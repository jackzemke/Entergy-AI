RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SOUTHERN's traditional business is primarily represented
by its five domestic electric utility operating companies, which provide
electric service in four Southeastern states. Another significant portion of
SOUTHERN's business is its non-traditional business primarily represented by
Southern Energy, which owns and manages international and domestic businesses
for SOUTHERN. Businesses acquired by Southern Energy have been included in the
consolidated statements of income since the date of acquisition. Certain changes
in operating revenues and expenses from the prior period result from such
acquisitions.

Earnings

SOUTHERN's consolidated net income for the second quarter
and year-to-date 1999 was $314 million ($0.45 per share) and $538 million ($0.77
per share), respectively, compared to $270 million ($0.39 per share) and $512
million ($0.74 per share) for the corresponding periods of 1998. Earnings for
the traditional business were relatively flat in the second quarter.
Year-to-date earnings for the traditional business were down due primarily to
mild weather. Earnings for the non-traditional business rose primarily due to
profits from significant new investments in power-generation businesses in New
England and California, improved performance and continued growth of Southern
Company Energy Marketing's trading business and increased profitability from
Southern Energy's Asian business units.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Operating revenues. Operating revenues for the traditional business for the
second quarter and year-to-date 1999 decreased $188 million or 7.7% and $260
million or 5.9%, respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of
1998. Traditional business revenues decreased for this second quarter and
year-to-date 1999 due primarily to mild weather which affected retail energy
sales and a retail rate reduction ordered by the Georgia PSC which affected
GEORGIA's revenues. Retail revenues, excluding fuel and any demand-side program
revenues which generally do not affect income, decreased $147 million for the
second quarter and $192 million year-to-date 1999. Operating revenues for
Southern Energy increased approximately $59 million or 13.3% and $72 million or
7.6%, respectively, during the second quarter and year-to-date 1999 when
compared to the corresponding periods in 1998. The increases in Southern
Energy's operating revenues are primarily attributed to its recent investments
in power-generation businesses in New England and California, which were
partially offset by a decrease in revenues at SWEB and the deconsolidation of
Mobile Energy. Effective with the bankruptcy filing in January 1999, Mobile
Energy is accounted for under the equity method, rather than being consolidated
as before. See Note (O) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements"
herein for further information regarding Mobile Energy. Reference is also made
to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Non-Traditional Business" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Fuel expense. The increases in this expense for the current quarter and
year-to-date 1999 are attributed to the acquisitions of power-generating
businesses in New England and California.

     Purchased power expense. Purchased power expense for the traditional
business fell approximately $19 million or 18.1% and $45 million or 25.6%,
respectively, for the second quarter and year-to-date 1999. The decrease in
these expenses for the traditional business is mainly attributed to a decrease
in energy purchases related to power marketing activities during this second
quarter and year-to-date 1999 when compared to the same periods in 1998. For the
non-traditional business, these expenses decreased $40 million or 20.1% for the
quarter and $47 million or 10.8% year-to-date due mainly to a decrease in
purchased power at SWEB.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. These decreases for the second
quarter and year-to-date 1999 when compared to the corresponding periods in 1998
are primarily attributed to higher depreciation charges recognized in 1998 under
the prior accounting order and the completion in 1998 of the amortization of
deferred Plant Vogtle costs. Under GEORGIA's new order, fixed rate reductions
and accelerated amortization are being recognized ratably throughout 1999.
During 1998, variable accelerated depreciation recorded under the previous
accounting order was primarily recognized during the higher revenue months.

     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. The second quarter
increase resulted from the continued improved profitability of Shajiao C
operations in China and Southern Company Energy Marketing. The year-to-date
increase in this item also reflects the $54 million settlement of Southern
Energy's claims against a contractor relating to the Shajiao C construction
project and the improvement in profitability of the Shajiao C operations. The
amount of the settlement of contractor claims was partially offset by other
related expenses and income taxes included in other income accounts.

     Interest income. Second quarter and year-to-date decreases are directly
related to the 1998 settlement of tax issues between SOUTHERN and the Internal
Revenue Service.

     Other, net. The changes in this item for the second quarter and
year-to-date are mainly due to reduced donations and contributions in these
periods when compared to the same periods in 1998.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     Interest on notes payable. The second quarter and year-to-date 1999
increases are attributed to the non-traditional business. These amounts
increased due to higher outstanding debt associated with Southern Energy's
acquisitions in late-1998 and the first half of 1999.

     Amortization of debt discount, premium and expense, net. These decreases
are related to accelerated amortization in 1998 of premiums incurred to
refinance high-cost debt.

     Other interest charges. These charges decreased in the second quarter and
year-to-date 1999 when compared to the same periods in 1998 due to the
recognition in 1998 of increased interest related to tax issues.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment, with non-traditional business becoming more
significant. For additional information relating to non-traditional business
activities, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Non-Traditional Business" in the Form 10-K.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is conducting an industry-wide
investigation concerning the compliance status of certain coal-fired generating
facilities, including certain units of the SOUTHERN system, under the new source
review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Although the outcome of this matter
cannot now be determined, if adverse it could result in substantial penalties
and additional capital costs.

     In April 1999, SOUTHERN, through its subsidiary Southern Energy, completed
the purchase of 3,065 megawatts of generating assets in California from Pacific
Gas & Electric for approximately $801 million.

     In June 1999, SOUTHERN, through its subsidiary Southern Energy, completed
its $484 million acquisition of 1,776 megawatts of generating capacity from
Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. and Consolidated Edison Company of New York.
Also, in June 1999, Southern Energy announced that it signed an agreement to
sell SWEB's supply business to London Electricity for $256 million or (pound)160
million and the assumption of certain liabilities. Further, Southern Energy
acquired a 9.99% interest in Shandong International Power Development Company
Limited for $104 million.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which was originally to be adopted by the year 2000.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral
of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which amends FASB Statement No.
133 to be effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 (January
1, 2001 for companies with calendar-year fiscal years). SOUTHERN has not yet
quantified the impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements;
however, the adoption could increase volatility in earnings and other
comprehensive income.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) through (F), (H) through (M), (O) and (P) in
the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of
various contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings
potential. Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings"
herein.


YEAR 2000 READINESS

Year 2000 Challenge

In recent decades, computer programmers shortened the year portion of date
entries to two digits to save processing time and storage space. Computers
assumed, in effect, that all years began with "19." This practice was widely
adopted and hard-coded into computer chips and processors found in some
equipment. This approach was used until the mid-1990s. Unless corrected before
the Year 2000, affected systems and devices containing a chip or microprocessor
with date and time functions could incorrectly process dates or the systems may
cease to function.

     SOUTHERN depends on complex computer systems for many aspects of its
operations, which include generation, transmission, and distribution of
electricity, as well as other business support activities. SOUTHERN met its Year
2000 readiness goal, when in June 1999 it announced that systems critical to
generating and delivering electricity to its customers in the Southeast are
ready for 2000. Year 2000 ready means that a system or application is determined
suitable for continued use through the Year 2000 and beyond. Critical systems
include, but are not limited to, reactor control systems, safe shutdown systems,
turbine generator systems, control center computer systems, customer service
systems, energy management systems, and telephone switches and equipment.

Year 2000 Program and Status

SOUTHERN's executive management recognizes the seriousness of the Year 2000
challenge and has dedicated what it believes to be adequate resources to address
the issue. The Millennium Project is a team of employees, IBM consultants, and
other contractors whose progress is reviewed regularly by a steering committee
of SOUTHERN executives.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     SOUTHERN's traditional business refers to the integrated utility services
within Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. For this traditional
business, the work was divided into two phases. Phase 1 began in 1996 and
consisted of identifying and assessing corporate assets related to software
systems and devices that contain a computer chip or clock. The first phase was
completed in June 1997. Phase 2 consisted of testing and remediating high
priority systems and devices. Also, contingency planning is included in this
phase. The second phase was completed on schedule in June 1999. The Millennium
Project will continue to monitor the affected computer systems, devices, and
applications into the Year 2000.

     For the traditional business, SOUTHERN completed the activities contained
in its work plan by function as follows:

                                                       Work Plan

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     For the non-traditional business, Southern Energy has adopted a three-phase
plan to address the Year 2000 challenge at its North American and international
business units in which they have management control. The first phase consists
of awareness and planning, inventory and assessment, and it includes the
identification of potentially impacted systems and an assessment of their
individual Year 2000 readiness. The second phase, which includes testing,
remediation, and validation, consists of modification or replacement of impacted
equipment, and verification that those modifications have addressed the issue.
Contingency planning is the third phase, and it includes backup plans for
unexpected events with critical systems, staffing plans for critical date
rollovers, and plans to address external dependencies. Business units are using
Year 2000 readiness information received from suppliers, including fuel
suppliers, to determine if inventory adjustments are needed for the transition
period.

     The following three tables summarize the status of progress of Southern
Energy's North American and international business units as of June 30, 1999.

     In a number of the international business units, Southern Energy is neither
the majority owner nor the managing concern. In these circumstances, Southern
Energy is providing technical assistance but does not control the schedule or
progress.

Year 2000 Costs

For the traditional business, current projected total costs for Year 2000
readiness are approximately $91 million, which includes $6 million of cost
billed to non-affiliated companies. These costs include labor necessary to
identify, test, and renovate affected devices and systems. From its inception
through June 30, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized primarily as
expense, amounted to $81 million based on SOUTHERN's ownership interest. In
addition to the traditional business costs, current projections for Year 2000
program costs are approximately $20 million for the non-traditional business -
based on SOUTHERN's ownership interest of which $14 million has been spent
through June 30, 1999.

Year 2000 Risks

SOUTHERN has implemented a detailed process to minimize the possibility of
service interruptions related to the Year 2000. Based on tests we have
conducted, we believe service interruptions related to Year 2000 challenges are
unlikely. These tests increase confidence, but do not guarantee error-free
operations. The company has taken what it believes to be prudent steps to
prepare for the Year 2000, and it expects any interruptions in service that may
occur within the traditional business service territory to be isolated and short
in duration, similar to service loss during a storm.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     SOUTHERN expects the risks associated with Year 2000 to be no more severe
than the scenarios that its electric system is routinely prepared to handle. The
most likely worst case scenario consists of the service loss of one of the
largest generating units and/or the service loss of any single bulk transmission
element in its traditional business service territory. There is a smaller risk
of sporadic and temporary fluctuations of power levels that would be aggravated
in the event of rapid and unscheduled changes to load patterns that resulted
from the activity of third parties. SOUTHERN has followed a proven methodology
for identifying and assessing software and devices containing potential Year
2000 challenges. Remediation and testing of those devices is complete. SOUTHERN
has prepared contingency plans as appropriate and has participated and will
continue to participate in North American Electric Reliability
Council-coordinated national drills during 1999.

     SOUTHERN continues to review the Year 2000 readiness of material third
parties that provide goods and services crucial to SOUTHERN's operations. Among
such critical third parties are fuel, transportation, telecommunications, water,
chemical, and other suppliers. There is some risk associated with
representations by third parties regarding their readiness and completion of
their own Year 2000 related work. Contingency plans based on the assessment of
each third party's ability to continue supplying critical goods and services to
SOUTHERN have been developed and are being reviewed.

     There is a potential for some earnings erosion caused by reduced electrical
demand by customers because of their own Year 2000 challenges. The risk
associated with the progress of some operations outside the United States is a
function of the local regulatory environment and the priorities of the entities
with management control. Year 2000 challenges are included in the list of due
diligence activities associated with acquisitions; there is some risk associated
with the subsequent validation of any given seller's representations.

Contingency Plans

Because of experience with hurricanes and other storms, the traditional business
is skilled at developing and using contingency plans in unusual circumstances.
As part of Year 2000 business continuity and contingency planning, SOUTHERN has
drawn on that experience to make risk assessments and develop additional plans
to deal specifically with Year 2000 challenges. SOUTHERN is identifying critical
operational locations, and scheduling key employees to be on duty at those
locations during the Year 2000 transition. SOUTHERN has already participated in
one of two North American Electric Reliability Council-coordinated national
drills during 1999, and has/is conducting additional drills to validate its
contingency plans. A successful drill focused on SOUTHERN's ability to maintain
critical voice and data exchange during partial loss of primary voice and data
communications systems. Because of the level of detail of the contingency
planning process, management feels that the contingency plans will keep any
service interruptions that may occur within the traditional business service
territory isolated and short in duration, similar to service loss during a
storm.

     Contingency planning efforts for the non-traditional business are complete
for North American assets and are underway for international assets. These
contingency plans are being developed by utilizing consistent formats and
guidelines.

     The material in this section constitutes forward-looking statements made
pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There can be
no assurance that the actual results of SOUTHERN, its suppliers, or other third
party dependencies will not materially differ from expectations.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first six months of
1999 included $1.1 billion used for gross property additions to utility plant,
and $1.5 billion used for Southern Energy acquisitions. The funds for these
additions and other capital requirements were from operations and sales of
securities. See SOUTHERN's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

     Reference is made to the SOUTHERN's Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Comprehensive Income herein for information relating to other comprehensive
income. During the first six months, Southern Energy recognized $116 million of
after-tax foreign exchange translation losses in other comprehensive income
which were principally related to shifts in exchange rates between the U.S.
dollar and the pound sterling and the Deutschemark, and to the 50% devaluation
of the Brazilian Real.

Financing Activities

During the first six months of 1999, retirements and redemptions of the
operating companies' first mortgage bonds and preferred stock totaled $525
million and $86 million, respectively. In February 1999, Alabama Power Capital
Trust III, a statutory business trust established for the purpose of holding
ALABAMA's junior subordinated notes and issuing trust preferred securities and

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     During the first six months of 1999, SOUTHERN raised $24 million from the
issuance of 885 thousand shares of common stock under SOUTHERN's various stock
plans. See Note (P) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for discussion of programs to repurchase SOUTHERN's common stock. The market
price of SOUTHERN's common stock at June 30, 1999 was $26.50 per share and the
book value was $13.81 per share, representing a market-to-book ratio of 192%,
compared to $29.0625, $14.04 and 207%, respectively, at the end of 1998. The
dividend for the second quarter of 1999 was $0.335 per share.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements for Construction", "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern electric
system's capital requirements for its construction program, sinking fund
requirements and maturing debt, and environmental compliance efforts.
Approximately $1.1 billion will be required by June 30, 2000, for redemptions
and maturities of long-term debt. Also, the operating companies plan to
continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and
preferred stock and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 1999, as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
See Item 1 - BUSINESS "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
June 30, 1999, approximately $449 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $6.1 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks of which
$124.7 million expired on July 14, 1999. Of the remaining $5.9 billion, $1.4
billion of such arrangements provide liquidity support to variable rate
pollution control bonds. At June 30, 1999, the system companies had outstanding
approximately $1.2 billion of short-term notes payable and $2.8 billion of
commercial paper. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

     See Note (D) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for discussion of financial derivative contracts entered into by SOUTHERN.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
and year-to-date 1999 was $93.0 million and $156.1 million, respectively,
compared to $94.8 million and $160.8 million for the corresponding periods of
1998. Earnings for the current quarter and year-to-date decreased $1.7 million
or 1.8% and $4.7 million or 2.9%, respectively, due primarily to decreases in
operating revenues.

</TABLE>

     Revenues. Including fuel revenues, revenues for the second quarter and
year-to-date 1999 were down from the corresponding periods in 1998 due primarily
to decreases in retail energy sales and revenues from unit power sales. Retail
energy sales for the current quarter and year-to-date 1999 decreased by 3.6% and
1.1%, respectively, due to milder weather in the second quarter of 1999 as
compared to extremely hot weather in the second quarter of 1998 and lower
industrial sales. Revenues from unit power sales for the current quarter and
year-to-date 1999 decreased 22.3% and 18.4%, respectively, as a result of lower
energy sales and a lowering of the equity return under formula rate contracts.
See Note (F) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for
further details. Retail revenues, excluding those revenues which represent the
recovery of fuel expense and certain other expenses and do not affect income,
decreased $12.7 million for the current quarter and $10.6 million year-to-date.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power from non-affiliates. These expenses dropped during this
quarter and year-to-date 1999 when compared to the corresponding periods of 1998
due primarily to increased purchases in 1998 related to power marketing
activities, a majority of which were resold to non-affiliated third parties.
These transactions had no significant effect on net income.

     Other operation expense. Current quarter and year-to-date 1999 increases
are due primarily to higher administrative and general expenses.

     Maintenance expense. These expenses decreased for the current quarter and
year-to-date 1999 due mainly to decreases in steam and distribution expenses.
For year-to-date 1999, the effect of these decreases was partially offset by an
increase in transmission expenses.

     Interest income. The decreases for the current quarter and year-to-date
1999 are primarily attributed to the recording by ALABAMA during the second

Internal Revenue Service. For additional information, see Note 3 to the
financial statements of ALABAMA under the caption "Tax Litigation" in Item 8 of
the Form 10-K.

     Amortization of debt discount, premium and expense, net. The decreases for
the current quarter and year-to-date when compared to the same periods in 1998
are directly related to accelerated amortization in 1998 of premiums incurred to
refinance high-cost debt. For additional information, see Note 3 to the
financial statements of ALABAMA under the caption "Retail Rate Adjustment
Procedures" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in
the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is conducting an industry-wide
investigation concerning the compliance status of certain coal-fired generating
facilities, including certain of ALABAMA's units, under the new source review
provisions of the Clean Air Act. Although the outcome of this matter cannot now
be determined, if adverse it could result in substantial penalties and
additional capital costs.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     ALABAMA's plans to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been implemented and
are included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related to
ALABAMA's Year 2000 program, including ALABAMA's share of costs of Southern
Nuclear Operating Company, are expected to be $37.0 million. From its inception
through June 30, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized primarily as
expense, amounted to $32.5 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
Condition - "Future Earnings Potential" herein.

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which was originally to be adopted by the year 2000.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral
of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which amends FASB Statement No.
133 to be effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 (January
1, 2001 for companies with calendar-year fiscal years). ALABAMA has not yet
quantified the impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements;
however, the adoption could increase volatility in reported earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), and (F) through (J) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first six months of
1999 included the addition of approximately $321.2 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Financing Activities

During the first six months of 1999, redemptions of first mortgage bonds and
preferred stock by ALABAMA totaled $300 million and $50 million, respectively.
In February 1999, Alabama Power Capital Trust III (the "Trust"), a statutory
business trust established for the purpose of holding ALABAMA's junior
subordinated notes and issuing trust preferred securities and common securities,
sold $50 million of its capital auction preferred securities which are
guaranteed by ALABAMA. The Trust invested the proceeds in Series C junior
subordinated notes. The net proceeds received by ALABAMA were used to repay a
portion of ALABAMA's outstanding short-term indebtedness. See Note (G) in the "
Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information.
In May 1999, ALABAMA issued $200 million of 6.75% senior notes due June 30,
2039. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of its outstanding short-term
indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. In June 1999, ALABAMA
sold, through public authorities, $101.6 million aggregate principal amount of
variable rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds due June 1, 2022. The
proceeds from the sale will be applied to the full redemption of the Series 1994
6 1/2% pollution control revenue refunding bonds on or about September 1, 1999.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     ALABAMA will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and
replace these securities with lower-cost capital as market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of ALABAMA
under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital requirements
for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental compliance
efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at June 30,
1999, approximately $15.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and had unused
committed lines of credit of approximately $1 billion of which $124.7 million
expired on July 14, 1999. Of the remaining $899.7 million of committed lines,
$418.7 million may be borrowed upon only to fund purchase obligations relating
to variable rate pollution control bonds. Additionally, in July 1999, ALABAMA
entered into an Extendible Commercial Note program. ALABAMA has regulatory
authority for up to $750 million of short-term borrowings. At June 30, 1999,
ALABAMA had outstanding $276.8 million of commercial paper.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of June 30, 1999, and the related condensed statements of income for
the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 1999 and 1998 and cash
flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 1999 and 1998. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1998
(not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 10, 1999, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1998 is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   SECOND QUARTER 1999 vs. SECOND QUARTER 1998

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
and year-to-date 1999 was $138.6 million and $230.2 million, respectively,
compared to $136.7 million and $242.6 million for the same periods in 1998.
Second quarter 1999 earnings increased slightly by $1.9 million or 1.4% while
year-to-date 1999 earnings decreased by $12.4 million or 5.1% due primarily to
lower operating revenues. Operating revenues were affected by fixed rate
reductions ordered by the 1998 Georgia PSC rate order and milder temperatures as
compared to 1998. Under the new order, fixed rate reductions and accelerated
amortization are being recognized ratably throughout 1999. During 1998, variable
accelerated depreciation recorded under the previous accounting order was
primarily recognized during the higher revenue months. See Note (K) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further details
regarding the retail rate order.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

     Revenues. Revenues within the service area decreased by $149.7 million and
$190.6 million, for the second quarter and year-to-date 1999, respectively, when
compared to the same periods in 1998. Retail revenues, excluding fuel revenues
which generally do not affect income, decreased $129.4 million and $176.8
million, respectively, for the second quarter and year-to-date 1999 when
compared to the corresponding periods in 1998 primarily due to retail rate
reductions ordered by the Georgia PSC and milder weather in 1999 compared to
1998. Energy sales in the second quarter and year-to-date 1999 decreased by 2.9%
for each of these periods when compared to the same periods in 1998 due to mild
temperatures. In particular, residential energy sales were down by 10.4% and
5.5%, respectively, for the second quarter and year-to-date.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     Wholesale revenues within the service area decreased $12.3 million and
$22.1 million, respectively, during the second quarter and year-to-date 1999
primarily as a result of a scheduled reduction in capacity revenues under a
power supply agreement with OPC and a decrease in energy sales. Wholesale
revenues outside the service area increased by $10.0 million for the second
quarter of 1999 and decreased by $3.9 million year-to-date 1999 when compared to
the corresponding periods in 1998. The second quarter increase in wholesale
revenues outside the service area is attributed to capacity adjustments under
long-term contracts recorded during the second quarter of 1998. The year-to-date
decrease was mainly due to lower energy sales.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The decreases for this second quarter
and year-to-date 1999 when compared to the same periods in 1998 were mainly due
to higher demand in 1998 for energy and higher energy purchases in 1998 related
to power marketing activities, a majority of which were resold to non-affiliated
third parties. These transactions had no significant effect on net income.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. This item decreased in the second
quarter and year-to-date 1999 when compared to the corresponding periods in 1998
due mainly to higher depreciation charges recognized in 1998 under the prior
accounting order and the completion in 1998 of the amortization of deferred
Plant Vogtle costs.

     Interest income. The decreases in this item for the current quarter and
year-to-date 1999 are related to the recognition, in the corresponding periods
of 1998, of increased interest income resulting from the resolution of tax
issues between SOUTHERN and the Internal Revenue Service.

     Other, net. The changes for the second quarter and year-to-date 1999 are
attributed to reduced donations and contributions in these periods when compared
to the corresponding periods in 1998.

     Income taxes applicable to other income. The second quarter and
year-to-date 1999 decreases are attributed to taxes in 1998 on the additional
interest income discussed above.

     Other interest charges. For the current quarter and year-to-date 1999,
these charges were lower when compared to the same periods in 1998 due to the
recognition in 1998 of increased interest related to tax issues.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary companies. Second
quarter and year-to-date 1999 increases are attributed to the issuance of
additional mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in February 1999.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including weather, regulatory matters and energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     Effective January 1, 1999, GEORGIA began operating under a new three-year
retail rate order. Under the order, GEORGIA's earnings are evaluated against a
retail return on common equity range of 10% to 12.5%. In compliance with the
order, retail rates were decreased by $262 million on an annual basis effective
January 1, 1999. Reference is made to Note (K) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein and Item 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     In September 1998, OPC decreased its purchases of capacity under a power
supply agreement by 250 megawatts, resulting in a $16 million reduction in 1999
revenues. The resources associated with the decreased purchases in 1998 will be
used to meet the needs of GEORGIA's retail customers through 2004. As a result
of additional reduction notices given by OPC under its agreement with GEORGIA,
GEORGIA's capacity revenues received from OPC were estimated to decrease by an
additional $7 million in 1999, $18 million in 2000 and $4 million in 2001.
Effective April 1, 1999, GEORGIA and OPC entered into a new agreement which will
delay, in part, planned purchase reductions by OPC. The new agreement has been
filed with the FERC under SOUTHERN's market-based rate authority. Based on the
above, GEORGIA's capacity revenues received from OPC are now estimated to
decrease by approximately $6 million in 1999, $15 million in 2000 and $7 million
in 2001.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings. For additional information, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the
Form 10-K.

     The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is conducting an industry-wide
investigation concerning the compliance status of certain coal-fired generating
facilities, including certain of GEORGIA's units, under the new source review
provisions of the Clean Air Act. Although the outcome of this matter cannot now
be determined, if adverse it could result in substantial penalties and
additional capital costs.

     GEORGIA's plans to achieve Year 2000 compliance have been implemented and
are included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related to
GEORGIA's Year 2000 program, including GEORGIA's share of costs of Southern
Nuclear Operating Company, are expected to be approximately $41 million. From
its inception through June 30, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized as
expense, amounted to $37 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which was originally to be adopted by the year 2000.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral
of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which amends FASB Statement No.
133 to be effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 (January
1, 2001 for companies with calendar-year fiscal years). GEORGIA has not yet
quantified the impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements;
however, the adoption could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (F), (G), and (K) through (M) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first six months of
1999 was the addition of approximately $353.5 million to gross plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations. See GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

During the first six months of 1999, redemptions of first mortgage bonds and
preferred stock by GEORGIA totaled $209 million and $35.7 million, respectively.
In February 1999, Georgia Power Capital Trust IV, a statutory business trust
established for the purpose of holding GEORGIA's junior subordinated notes and
issuing trust preferred securities and common securities, sold $200 million of
its 6.85% trust preferred securities, which are guaranteed by GEORGIA. (See Note
(G) in the " Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein and Item 7
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Financing Activities" of GEORGIA in the
Form 10-K for further details.) In March 1999, GEORGIA issued $100 million of 6
5/8% senior notes due March 31, 2039. The proceeds from this issuance were used
to repay a portion of GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness. In May
1999, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, $53 million of 5.45% pollution
control revenue bonds due May 1, 2034; $85 million of 5.40% pollution control
revenue bonds due May 1, 2034; and $100 million of 5.25% pollution control
revenue bonds due May 1, 2034. The proceeds of these sales were used to redeem
$50 million aggregate principal amount of 6.35% pollution control revenue bonds
in June 1999; $125 million aggregate principal amount of 6.60% pollution control
revenue bonds in July 1999; and $60 million aggregate principal amount of 6 3/8%
pollution control revenue bonds in August 1999.

     GEORGIA plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Issues" in the
Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital requirements for its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at June 30,
1999, approximately $24.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$1.3 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. Of the $1.3 billion, $980
million provides liquidity support to GEORGIA's variable rate pollution control
bonds. At June 30, 1999, GEORGIA had $318.2 million and $170.3 million
outstanding in short-term notes payable to banks and commercial paper,
respectively. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of June 30, 1999, and the related condensed
statements of income for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30,
1999 and 1998 and cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 1999 and
1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1998
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 10, 1999, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1998, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter and
year-to-date 1999 was $13.2 million and $18.0 million, respectively, compared to
$13.4 million and $20.2 million for the corresponding periods of 1998. While
earnings for the current quarter remained relatively flat when compared to the
same period in 1998, earnings year-to-date declined by 10.8%, primarily due to
higher maintenance expenses incurred during the first quarter of 1999.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>

     Revenues. The decreases in revenues for the second quarter and year-to-date
1999 reflect, for the most part, the recovery of lower fuel costs. The price per
ton of coal, which is GULF's primary fuel source, was lower in the second
quarter and year-to-date 1999 compared to the same periods in 1998 due to full
amortization, by March 1998, of costs related to prior year coal contract
renegotiations and the reduction of a major coal contract price. Excluding
recovery of fuel expense and certain other expenses that do not affect income,
retail revenues decreased $6.6 million for the quarter and $5.5 million
year-to-date, primarily due to a decrease in energy sales to residential
customers reflecting the impact of milder-than-normal temperatures during the
first half of 1999 as compared to hotter-than-normal temperatures recorded in
the same periods in 1998. Revenues from non-territorial wholesale energy sales
decreased $1.3 million and $4.0 million for the second quarter and year-to-date
1999, respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of 1998. The
decreases in non-territorial wholesale energy sales were primarily due to
decreased sales through power marketing activities.

     Revenues from affiliates. Revenues from sales to affiliated companies
within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. The decreases in fuel expense reflect lower fuel costs,
resulting from the reduction of a major coal contract price.

     Other operation expense. This item decreased in this quarter when compared
to the same period in 1998 due to lower administrative and general expenses.
Year-to-date 1999, this cost decreased due to lower administrative and general
expenses as well as prior year payments related to renegotiations of coal supply
contracts being fully amortized in 1998.

     Maintenance expense. The increases in these expenses for the second quarter
and year-to-date 1999 reflect scheduled maintenance on steam plant facilities.

     Other interest charges. The decreases for the current quarter and
year-to-date 1999 are primarily attributed to the recognition, in 1998, of
interest related to tax issues.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the
Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is conducting an industry-wide
investigation concerning the compliance status of certain coal-fired generating
facilities, including certain of GULF's units, under the new source review
provisions of the Clean Air Act. Although the outcome of this matter cannot now
be determined, if adverse it could result in substantial penalties and
additional capital costs.

     GULF's plans to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been implemented and are
included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related to GULF's
Year 2000 program are expected to be $5.2 million. From its inception through
June 30, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized as expense, amounted to
$4.2 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION - "Future Earnings
Potential" herein.

     In reference to the ongoing matters with the Florida PSC concerning GULF's
authorized return on equity (ROE) and the outstanding balances of certain
regulatory assets, GULF filed a revised plan on April 6, 1999. The staff of the
Florida PSC countered with another proposal on April 8, 1999. Both were
presented to the Commission at the April 20, 1999, agenda conference. The
Florida PSC approved the staff's proposal with several modifications. The
changes approved by the Florida PSC included the following: a reduction in the
authorized return mid-point from 12.0% to 11.5%, the sharing of revenues for a
period of 3 years above an earnings level of 12.5% ROE up to 14% ROE, revenue
credits to customers and the write-off of regulatory

sharing, and other regulatory issues on May 24, 1999. On June 14, 1999, the
Coalition for Equitable Rates filed a protest requesting a formal proceeding to
review the plan proposed by the Florida PSC order. Hearings in the docket are
expected later this year or early in 2000. On July 22, 1999, the Office of
Public Counsel petitioned the Florida PSC to initiate and conduct a full revenue
requirements base rate proceeding for GULF. No action has been taken by the
Florida PSC on the Office of Public Counsel's petition. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" and Item 1 - Business - "Regulation - State Commissions" of
GULF in the Form 10-K.

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which was originally to be adopted by the year 2000.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral
of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which amends FASB Statement No.
133 to be effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 (January
1, 2001 for companies with calendar-year fiscal years). Adoption of this
statement is not expected to have a material impact on GULF's financial
statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (F) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first six months of 1999
included the addition of approximately $33.2 million to utility plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

GULF plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost
debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and "Other
Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of GULF's capital
requirements for its construction program, environmental compliance efforts and
maturing debt.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at June 30, 1999,
approximately $3.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $31.5 million of
unused committed lines of credit with banks in addition to $61.9 million
liquidity support for variable rate pollution control bonds. At June 30, 1999,
GULF had $85.0 million of short-term notes payable to banks. Management believes
that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of
credit without maintaining large cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second
quarter and year-to-date 1999 was $14.9 million and $22.1 million, respectively,
compared to $13.7 million and $22.1 million for the corresponding periods of
1998. Earnings for the current quarter increased $1.2 million or 9.1% due
primarily to an increase in operating revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>


     Revenues. Revenue increases for the second quarter and year-to-date 1999
result primarily from increased energy sales to territorial wholesale customers
and year-to-date, to a lesser extent, from increased retail energy sales. These
revenue increases were partially offset by decreases in non-territorial
wholesale energy sales for the quarter and year-to-date of 21.8% and 40.7%,
respectively. Territorial wholesale energy sales were up 11.6% for the quarter
and 11.4% year-to-date due to strong growth in the wholesale service areas. In
addition, for the quarter, retail energy sales to industrial customers were up
3.9%, while energy sales to residential and commercial customers were down by
6.9% and 0.2%. Year-to-date, retail energy sales to commercial and industrial
customers were up 4.3% and 2.2%, respectively, while energy sales to residential
customers were down 6.1%. Industrial energy sales were positively impacted by
increased production by several larger industrial customers, while commercial
energy sales were positively impacted by increased tourism and strong growth in
this sector. Residential energy sales were lower due to milder temperatures
during the current quarter and year-to-date when compared same periods in 1998.
Retail revenues, excluding those revenues which represent the recovery of fuel
expense and certain other expenses and do not affect income, increased $1.3
million for the current quarter and $0.6 million year-to-date. Wholesale
territorial revenues, excluding fuel revenues which do not affect income,
increased $2.6 million for the current quarter and $5.7 million year-to-date.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. This item decreased for the quarter
and year-to-date 1999 when compared to the corresponding periods in 1998
reflecting the decrease in the demand for energy.

     Other operation expense. These costs decreased for the current quarter and
year-to-date due primarily to a decrease in administrative and general expenses.
Administrative and general expenses were down due to higher amortization of the
work force reduction plan in 1998.

     Maintenance expense. These expenses were up for the quarter and
year-to-date due to increased maintenance on distribution lines.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment. Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in
rates under the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force
on electric rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking place.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. MISSISSIPPI's 1999 ECO Plan filing was approved, as
filed, by the Mississippi PSC on March 18, 1999 and resulted in a slight
increase in customer prices. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is conducting an industry-wide
investigation concerning the compliance status of certain coal-fired generating
facilities, including certain of MISSISSIPPI's units, under the new source
review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Although the outcome of this matter
cannot now be determined, if adverse it could result in substantial penalties
and additional capital costs.

     MISSISSIPPI's plans to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been implemented
and are included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related
to MISSISSIPPI's Year 2000 program are expected to be $4.9 million. From its
inception through June 30, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized as
expense, amounted to $4.6 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION - "Future Earnings Potential" herein.

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which was to be adopted by the year 2000.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Deferral
of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133 - an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 133, which delayed adoption until the year 2001. MISSISSIPPI has not yet
quantified the impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements;
however, the adoption could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (F) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first six months
of 1999 included the addition of approximately $26.7 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
for further details.

Financing Activities

MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

In April 1999, MISSISSIPPI and Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership
("Escatawpa"), entered into a lease agreement whereby MISSISSIPPI will design
and construct, as agent for Escatawpa, a 1,064 megawatt natural gas combined
cycle facility. It is expected that the project will cost approximately $406
million, and upon completion of the facility, MISSISSIPPI will lease the
facility from Escatawpa for an initial term of approximately 10 years. For
additional information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS - "Capital Requirements for Construction" of MISSISSIPPI and Notes
3 and 4 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of
MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its construction program, environmental
compliance efforts, sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION




Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at June
30, 1999, approximately $4.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $76.3 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks
(including $10.8 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made
only to fund purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control
bonds). At June 30, 1999, MISSISSIPPI had short-term notes payable outstanding
of $69.0 million. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
and year-to-date 1999 was $5.3 million and $6.5 million, respectively, as
compared to $7.8 million and $10.2 million for the corresponding periods of
1998. Earnings decreased due to lower operating revenues primarily reflecting
the Georgia PSC's accounting order and, to a lesser extent, mild weather. For
additional information, see Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for details regarding the accounting order.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

</TABLE>


     Revenues. Revenues for the quarter and year-to-date 1999 fell primarily due
to lower total energy sales, particularly to the retail sector, and tariff
reductions implemented as a part of the Georgia PSC accounting order. Retail
energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers for the quarter
were down 8.3%, 1.8% and 9.2%, respectively. Year-to-date, retail energy sales
to these same customers were down 3.2%, 0.5% and 20.6%, respectively.
Residential and commercial energy sales were affected by the mild temperatures
while industrial energy sales were affected by reduced demand from one
industrial customer and the shut-down of another industrial customer's
facilities. In the second quarter and year-to-date 1999, the impacts on
SAVANNAH's revenues from this shut-down were $0.2 million and $0.4 million,
respectively. For additional information, see "Future Earnings Potential"
herein.

     Fuel expenses. The decreases in these costs from the corresponding periods
in 1998 are attributed to lower demand for energy and lower coal prices.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. This item increased during the
current quarter and year-to-date 1999 when compared to the corresponding periods
in 1998 due primarily to additional depreciation charges pursuant to the Georgia
PSC accounting order.

     Maintenance expense. The year-to-date increase is primarily attributed to
increased distribution line clearance expenses and a turbine dismantle
inspection of SAVANNAH's largest coal unit.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     In June 1998, the Georgia PSC approved a four-year accounting order for
SAVANNAH. Reference is made to Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     In mid-1998, one of SAVANNAH's largest industrial customers added an
additional steam turbine unit. The impact of this on SAVANNAH's revenues had
been planned for, and the customer is under contract for a minimum of 5
megawatts per year. In October 1998, another of SAVANNAH's largest customers
closed its Savannah operations. Base revenues from this customer had averaged $2
million annually. Under the terms of its contract with SAVANNAH, this customer
is obligated to pay $1 million annually through 2001.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH
in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is conducting an industry-wide
investigation concerning the compliance status of certain coal-fired generating
facilities, including certain of SAVANNAH's units, under the new source review
provisions of the Clean Air Act. Although the outcome of this matter cannot now
be determined, if adverse it could result in substantial penalties and
additional capital costs.

     SAVANNAH's plans to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been implemented and
are included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related to
SAVANNAH's Year 2000 program are expected to be $1.2 million. From its inception
through June 30, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized as expense,
amounted to $1.0 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION - "Future Earnings Potential" herein.

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which was originally to be adopted by the year 2000.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral
of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which amends FASB Statement No.
133 to be effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 (January
1, 2001 for companies with calendar-year fiscal years). SAVANNAH has not yet
quantified the impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements;
however, the adoption could increase volatility in earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first six months of
1999 included the addition of approximately $17 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations and credit arrangements with banks. See SAVANNAH's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

In June 1999, SAVANNAH purchased on the open market all $15 million outstanding
of its 7 7/8% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 1, 2025. This purchase was
financed with short-term debt. SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent
possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and replace these obligations
with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at June 30,
1999, approximately $3.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$25.1 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. At June 30, 1999,
SAVANNAH had $35.4 million outstanding of notes payable to banks. Since SAVANNAH
has no major generating plants under construction, management believes that the
need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)  The condensed financial  statements of the registrants included herein have
     been prepared by each registrant,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and
     regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of each registrant's management, the
     information   regarding  such  registrant  furnished  herein  reflects  all
     adjustments  necessary to present  fairly the results for the periods ended
     June 30,  1999 and  1998.  Certain  information  and  footnote  disclosures
     normally  included in  financial  statements  prepared in  accordance  with
     generally  accepted  accounting  principles  have been condensed or omitted
     pursuant to such rules and regulations,  although each registrant  believes
     that the  disclosures  regarding  such  registrant are adequate to make the
     information presented not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed
     financial  statements of each  registrant be read in  conjunction  with the
     financial  statements of such registrant and the notes thereto  included in
     the Form 10-K.  Certain  prior  period  amounts have been  reclassified  to
     conform with current period presentation.

         The condensed financial statements of ALABAMA and GEORGIA included
      herein have been reviewed by ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's independent public
      accountants as set forth in their reports included herein as Exhibit 1 to
      ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)   SOUTHERN's operating affiliates are subject to the provisions of FASB
      Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
      Regulation. In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no
      longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
      off related unrecoverable regulatory assets and liabilities, and determine
      if any other assets have been impaired. For additional information, see
      Note 1 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the
      Form 10-K.

(C)  The  staff of the SEC has  questioned  certain  of the  current  accounting
     practices of the electric utility industry--including SOUTHERN's--regarding
     the recognition,  measurement and classification of  decommissioning  costs
     for nuclear generating facilities in the financial statements.  In response
     to these  questions,  the FASB has  decided  to review the  accounting  for
     obligations  related to the  retirement  of  long-lived  assets,  including
     nuclear  decommissioning.  Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
     ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN,  ALABAMA and GEORGIA in
     Item 7 and Note 1 to the  financial  statements  of  SOUTHERN,  ALABAMA and
     GEORGIA under  "Depreciation and Nuclear  Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the
     Form 10-K.

(D)   SOUTHERN engages in price risk management activities. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Derivative Financial Instruments"
      and Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for a discussion of these activities. Activities for non-trading
      purposes consist of transactions that are employed to mitigate SOUTHERN's
      risk related to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate
      fluctuations. At June 30, 1999, the status of outstanding non-trading
      related derivative contracts was as follows:

      In January 1998, Southern Energy and Vastar Resources, Inc. combined their
      energy trading and marketing activities to form a joint venture. Southern
      Energy's investment in the joint venture is accounted for under the equity
      method of accounting. SOUTHERN and Vastar have made guarantees to certain
      counterparties regarding performance of contractual commitments by the
      joint venture. At June 30, 1999, outstanding guarantees related to the
      estimated fair value of net contractual commitments were approximately
      $115 million. Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
      "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 5 to the
      financial statements of SOUTHERN under the captions "Financial Instruments
      for Trading Activities" and "Energy Trading and Marketing Commitments",
      respectively, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(E)   SOUTHERN's principal business segment -- or its traditional business -- is
      the five regulated electric utility operating companies that provide
      electric service in four southeastern states. The other reportable
      business segment is non-traditional energy services provided by Southern
      Energy, which develops and manages electricity and other energy-related
      projects both in the United States and abroad. Intersegment revenues are
      not material. Financial data for business segments for the periods covered
      in the Form 10-Q are as follows:

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


      (Note) The all other category includes parent SOUTHERN, which does not
      allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category
      includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate
      disclosure. These segments include a wireless communication company and a
      developmental company for energy products and services.
      Non-traditional services exclude interest expense to parent SOUTHERN.

(F)   Reference is made to Notes 3 and 7 to each of the registrant's financial
      statements, except SAVANNAH'S, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a discussion
      of the FERC orders in proceedings regarding the reasonableness of the
      return on common equity on certain of the Southern electric system's
      wholesale rate schedules and contracts and a discussion of the long-term
      power sales agreements. A settlement agreement relating to the proceedings
      pending at the FERC which provides for an equity return of 11% under the
      formula rates has been filed with the FERC for its approval. If approved,
      these rates will be effective as of January 5, 1999 for three unit power
      sales contracts, and as of July 1, 1999 for the other contracts.

(G)   During the first six months of 1999, statutory business trusts, formed by
      ALABAMA and GEORGIA of which such companies own all the common securities,
      issued mandatorily redeemable preferred securities as follows: (in
      thousands)

</TABLE>

      Substantially all the assets of each trust are junior subordinated notes
      issued by the related company in the respective approximate principal
      amounts set forth above. ALABAMA and GEORGIA consider that the mechanisms
      and obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its
      benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by
      it of the respective trusts' payment obligations with respect to the
      preferred securities.

(H)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to retail rate
      adjustment procedures.

(I)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and to Note (I) to each registrant's
      quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1999, for
      information relating to a judgment against ALABAMA arising from discharges
      into Lake Martin.

(J)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to a class
      action charging ALABAMA with fraud and non-compliance with regulatory
      statutes relating to the offer, sale and financing of "extended service
      contracts" in connection with the sale of electric appliances. The class
      of plaintiffs has been decertified on the joint motion of the plaintiffs
      and ALABAMA, and it is expected that this action will be settled in the
      near future for an immaterial amount.

(K)  Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information  concerning a three-year
     rate order approved by the Georgia PSC effective January 1, 1999. The order
     decreased annual retail rates by $262 million effective January 1, 1999 and
     by an additional $24 million  effective  January 1, 2000. The order further
     provides for $85 million each year, plus up to $50 million  annually of any
     earnings in excess of a 12.5%  retail  return on common  equity  during the
     second  and third  years,  to be  applied to  accelerated  amortization  or
     depreciation of assets.  Two-thirds of any additional earnings in excess of
     the 12.5%  return  will be applied  to rate  reductions  and the  remaining
     one-third retained by GEORGIA.

(L)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
      designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
      Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
      environmental contingencies.

(M)  In September  1998,  OPC decreased its purchases of capacity  under a power
     supply agreement by 250 megawatts,  resulting in a $16 million reduction in
     1999 revenues.  The resources  associated  with the decreased  purchases in
     1998 will be used to meet the needs of GEORGIA's retail  customers  through
     2004.  As a result of additional  reduction  notices given by OPC under its
     agreement with GEORGIA,  GEORGIA's capacity revenues received from OPC were
     estimated to decrease by an additional  $7 million in 1999,  $18 million in
     2000 and $4  million in 2001.  Effective  April 1,  1999,  GEORGIA  and OPC
     entered into a new agreement  which will delay, in part,  planned  purchase
     reductions  by OPC.  The new  agreement  has been filed with the FERC under
     SOUTHERN's  market-based  rate  authority.  Based on the  above,  GEORGIA's
     capacity  revenues  received  from OPC are now  estimated  to  decrease  by
     approximately  $6  million in 1999,  $15  million in 2000 and $7 million in
     2001.

(N)   In 1998, the Georgia PSC approved a new accounting order for SAVANNAH.
      Under this order, SAVANNAH will reduce electric rates to its small
      business customers, expense additional storm damage accruals and accrue
      additional depreciation on generating assets. For additional information
      concerning the four-year accounting order approved by the Georgia PSC in
      June 1998, reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of
      SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(O)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item
     8 and to  Legal  Proceedings  in Item 3 of the Form  10-K  for  information
     relating to petitions for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  relief which were filed in
     the U. S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Alabama.  Effective
     with the bankruptcy  filing in January 1999, Mobile Energy is accounted for
     under  the  equity  method,  rather  than  being  consolidated  as  before.
     SOUTHERN's  equity  investment in Mobile Energy was $56 million at June 30,
     1999. At June 30, 1999,  Mobile Energy had total assets of $379 million and
     senior debt  outstanding  of $201 million of first  mortgage  bonds and $76
     million   related  to  tax-exempt   bonds.  In  connection  with  the  bond
     financings,  SOUTHERN  provided  certain  limited  guarantees,  in  lieu of
     funding debt service and maintenance  reserve  accounts with cash. In March
     1999,  under an agreement with the  bondholders,  SOUTHERN paid $36,144,000
     pursuant to the guarantees.  The bondholders  reserved the right to seek an
     additional $2,700,000,  which SOUTHERN believes was satisfied by an earlier
     transfer  of funds.  The  ultimate  outcome  of this  matter  cannot now be
     determined.

(P)   In 1998, SOUTHERN's Board of Directors authorized SOUTHERN to make open
      market purchases of its common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed
      $300 million through March 31, 1999. The purpose of the program was to
      provide shares of common stock for the purchase requirements of SOUTHERN's
      various stockholder, employee and outside director stock purchase plans.
      Under the program, 4.4 million shares had been repurchased and 2.4 million
      shares were reissued through June 30, 1999.

      Also, in April 1999, SOUTHERN's board approved the repurchase of up to 50
      million shares of SOUTHERN's common stock over the next two years through
      open market or privately negotiated transactions. The program does not
      establish a target stock price or timetable for specific repurchases.
      Under this program, 18,756,500 shares have been repurchased through August
      10, 1999, with funding provided from SOUTHERN's commercial paper program.
