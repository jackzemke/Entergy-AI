                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    THIRD QUARTER 1996 vs. THIRD QUARTER 1995
                                       AND
                     YEAR-TO-DATE 1996 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 1995


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SOUTHERN's  consolidated net income for the third quarter and year-to-date  1996
was  $467  million  ($0.69  per  share)  and $988  million  ($1.47  per  share),
respectively, compared to $469 million ($0.71 per share) and $943 million ($1.42
per  share)  for  the  corresponding   periods  of  1995.  This  resulted  in  a
consolidated net income decrease of 0.3% for the quarter and an increase of 4.8%
year to date. Milder weather during the third quarter of 1996 when compared with
the third quarter of 1995 kept earnings relatively flat;  however,  year-to-date
earnings of the core business were positively affected by more favorable weather
conditions  during the first half of 1996. The  performance  of Southern  Energy
(primarily  resulting from the acquisition of SWEB effective September 18, 1995)
also  contributed to 1996 earnings.  (Reference is made to Note 14 of SOUTHERN's
financial  statements  in Item 8 of the  Form  10-K for  additional  information
regarding the  acquisition of SWEB.  Reference is also made to "Future  Earnings
Potential" below relating to the sale, in July 1996, of a 25% share of SWEB to a
subsidiary of PP&L Resources, Inc.)

     SOUTHERN's  core  business is primarily  represented  by its five  domestic
electric  utility  operating  companies,  which provide electric service in four
Southeastern  states.  Another  significant  portion of  SOUTHERN's  business is
represented  by  Southern  Energy,  which  owns and  manages  international  and
domestic  businesses for SOUTHERN.  Businesses  acquired by Southern Energy have
been  included  in the  consolidated  statements  of  income  since  the date of
acquisition.  Certain changes in operating  revenues and expenses from the prior
period are the result of such acquisitions.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the
following:

     Operating revenues.  The changes in operating revenues of the core business
were  influenced  most  heavily by changes in the amount of retail  energy sold.
Compared to the corresponding  periods of 1995, total retail kilowatt-hour sales
for the third quarter  decreased  0.3%;  however,  for the current  year-to-date
period,  total retail  kilowatt-hour  sales  increased  3.7%.  Retail  revenues,
excluding  those revenues which  represent the  pass-through of fuel and certain
other  expenses and do not affect  income,  decreased  $48 million for the third
quarter and increased $79 million year-to-date 1996.  Residential and commercial
energy sales experienced the most significant changes for the third quarter and

year-to-date  periods,  respectively.  Compared to the corresponding  periods of
1995,  residential  kilowatt-hour  sales for the third quarter  decreased  5.2%;
however, for the current year-to-date  period,  residential  kilowatt-hour sales
increased 3.6%.  Commercial  kilowatt-hour sales increased 2.8% and 6.0% for the
current quarter and  year-to-date  periods,  respectively.  Compared to the same
periods of 1995,  there was growth in the number of  residential  and commercial
customers served;  however,  residential  energy sales were mainly influenced by
favorable weather conditions during the third quarter of 1995 and the first half
of 1996.  For the  third  quarter  and  year-to-date  1996,  operating  revenues
applicable to Southern  Energy-related  activities increased by $245 million and
$881 million,  respectively,  as compared to the corresponding  periods of 1995.
The primary reason for these increases relates to the acquisition of SWEB.

     Purchased  power  expense.  The  substantial  increase in  purchased  power
expense is attributable  to Southern  Energy-related  activities,  specifically,
SWEB's operations.  (SWEB's main business is the distribution of electricity. It
must purchase essentially all of its power.) Purchased power expense in the core
business  decreased  10.6% or $9 million  for the third  quarter  and 2.7% or $5
million for year-to-date 1996 compared to the corresponding periods of 1995.

     Maintenance expense. After excluding those amounts attributable to Southern
Energy-related  business  activities,  maintenance  expense  related to the core
business  increased $13 million or 9.3% for the third quarter and $46 million or
10.0% for year-to-date 1996 compared to the  corresponding  periods of 1995. The
increase  in the  current  quarter is  primarily  attributable  to the timing of
scheduled  maintenance  performed on generating units and a write-off by ALABAMA
of obsolete steam  generating  plant  inventory.  The  year-to-date  increase is
primarily  due to the timing of scheduled  maintenance  performed on  generating
units and an accrual by ALABAMA to  partially  replenish  its  natural  disaster
reserve.

     Depreciation  and  amortization  expense.  After  excluding  those  amounts
attributable to Southern  Energy-related  business activities,  depreciation and
amortization  expense in the core business  decreased $9 million or 3.7% for the
third quarter and increased $23 million or 3.5% for  year-to-date  1996 compared
to the  corresponding  periods of 1995.  The decrease in the current  quarter is
primarily due to a charge to  amortization  expense by GEORGIA in September 1995
for software  development costs. The increase in year-to-date 1996 is mainly due
to  accelerated  depreciation  of certain  generating  plants  pursuant to a new
retail rate plan at GEORGIA  effective  January 1, 1996,  and  additional  plant
investment.

     Taxes other than income taxes.  After excluding those amounts  attributable
to Southern  Energy-related  business activities,  taxes other than income taxes
associated  with the core business  increased $2 million or 1.4% for the current
quarter and $13 million or 3.4% for the current  year-to-date period compared to
the  corresponding  periods of 1995 primarily due to higher municipal and county
franchise  taxes.  Changes in such  franchise  taxes,  which are collected  from
customers, have no impact on earnings.

     Interest on long-term debt.  After excluding those amounts  attributable to
Southern Energy-related  business activities,  interest on long-term debt in the
core business decreased $12 million (9.6%) for the third quarter and $50 million
(13.3%)  year-to-date  1996  compared  to  the  corresponding  periods  of  1995
reflecting  the  redemption  and  refinancing of long-term debt by the operating
companies.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Interest on notes payable.  After excluding  those amounts  attributable to
Southern  Energy-related  business activities,  interest on notes payable in the
core  business  decreased  $3  million  or 20.0%  for the  current  quarter  and
increased  $5 million or 12.1%  year-to-date  1996  reflecting a lower amount of
short-term debt  outstanding in the current quarter  compared to the same period
of 1995 and a higher  amount  of  short-term  debt  outstanding  in the  current
year-to-date period compared to the corresponding period of 1995.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment, with Southern Energy and other business becoming more significant.

     With respect to Southern Energy-related  activities,  SOUTHERN received, in
April 1996,  an order from the SEC which in effect allows it to use the proceeds
from financings to increase its aggregate  investment in EWGs and FUCOs up to an
amount not  exceeding  100% of  SOUTHERN's  consolidated  retained  earnings.  A
consumer  group that had sought to intervene in the SEC  proceeding  has filed a
motion for  reconsideration  of such  order with the SEC and an appeal  with the
U.S.  Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.  At September 30, 1996,  SOUTHERN's
consolidated  retained  earnings  amounted to $3,836 million,  and its aggregate
investment  in  EWGs  and  FUCOs  amounted  to  $889  million.   For  additional
information   relating  to  Southern   Energy  and  SOUTHERN's   other  business
activities, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "New Business Development" in the Form 10-K.
In  addition to the  discussion  in the Form 10-K  relating to SWEB,  on July 1,
1996, Southern Energy sold,  indirectly,  a 25% share in SWEB to a subsidiary of
PP&L Resources, Inc. for some $189 million.

     On October 9, 1996, Southern Energy announced that a $2.7 billion agreement
had been entered into between Southern Energy,  Southern  Energy-Asia,  Inc. (an
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of SOUTHERN), Consolidated Electric Power Asia
Limited (CEPA) and Hopewell Holdings  Limited,  providing for the acquisition by
Southern  Energy-Asia of an 80% interest in CEPA.  For  additional  information,
reference  is made to the  Current  Report on Form 8-K,  dated  October 9, 1996,
filed by SOUTHERN.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is  positioning  the business to meet the challenge of  increasing  competition.
Legislation  has been  enacted in Alabama  that would  establish  a process  for
determining  whether  utilities  would  experience  "stranded  costs"  upon  the
transfer of an existing customer of a utility to another electric supplier. This
legislation  authorizes  the  Alabama  PSC to make a  determination  of  whether
stranded  costs  would  exist as a result of such a transfer  by a  customer  of
ALABAMA and could require the customer  seeking an  alternative  supplier to pay
any stranded costs found to exist.  The legislation  has termination  provisions
keyed  to  passage  of  comprehensive   retail  electric   service   competition
legislation which addresses  stranded costs of existing utilities and eliminates
the  obligation of utilities to provide  generating  resources.  For  additional
information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  "Competition"  and  Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS - "Future  Earnings  Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset.  For additional  information about the Clean Air Act and
other  environmental  issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

discussion  of various  contingencies  and other matters which may affect future
earnings  potential.  Reference  is  also  made  to  Part  II - Item 1 -  "Legal
Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in SOUTHERN's  financial condition during the first nine months
of 1996 was the addition of  approximately  $911 million to utility  plant.  The
funds for these additions and other capital  requirements were derived primarily
from operations.  See SOUTHERN's  Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

During the first nine months of 1996,  the operating  companies sold $60 million
of first  mortgage  bonds,  and  through  public  authorities,  $146  million of
pollution  control  revenue bonds.  Retirements,  including  maturities,  of the
operating  companies'  first mortgage bonds and pollution  control revenue bonds
totaled $463 million,  and redemptions of preferred stock totaled $79 million. A
subsidiary of ALABAMA  formed as a statutory  business trust sold $97 million of
trust preferred securities guaranteed by ALABAMA and loaned the proceeds of such
securities  to ALABAMA.  See Note (I) in the "Notes to the  Condensed  Financial
Statements"  herein for further  details.  A subsidiary  of GEORGIA  formed as a
statutory  business  trust  sold  $225  million  of trust  preferred  securities
guaranteed by GEORGIA and loaned the proceeds of such securities to GEORGIA. See
Note (K) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further
details.

     During the first nine months of 1996,  SOUTHERN raised $96 million from the
issuance of new common stock under  SOUTHERN's  various stock plans.  The market
price of SOUTHERN's  common stock at September 30, 1996 was $22.50 per share and
the book  value was $13.64 per share,  representing  a  market-to-book  ratio of
165%, compared to $24.625,  $13.10 and 188%,  respectively,  at the end of 1995.
The dividend for the third quarter of 1996 was $0.315 per share.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of SOUTHERN
under  "Capital  Requirements  for  Construction,"  "Environmental  Matters" and
"Other Capital  Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern
electric   system's  capital   requirements   for  its   construction   program,
environmental  compliance efforts,  sinking fund requirements and maturing debt.
Approximately  $312 million will be required by September 30, 1997,  for present
sinking fund  requirements,  redemption of preferred  stock and  redemptions and
maturities of long-term debt. Also, the operating companies plan to continue, to
the extent  possible,  a program to retire  higher-cost debt and preferred stock
and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the  financing  activities  previously  described,  SOUTHERN  may
require  additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of  additional  equity  capital  to be raised in 1996,  as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources  similar to those used in the past.  The amount,  type and
timing of any  financings--if  needed--will  depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings,  regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors.
Currently,  each of the operating  companies  expects to have adequate  earnings
coverage  ratios for any  anticipated  security sales through at least 1998. See
Item  1  BUSINESS  -  "Financing  Programs"  in the  Form  10-K  for  additional
information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
September 30, 1996,  approximately $381 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $4,119 million of unused credit arrangements with banks (including
$808 million of such  arrangements  under which  borrowings  may be made only to
fund purchase  obligations of the operating  companies relating to variable rate
pollution  control  bonds).  At September  30, 1996,  the system  companies  had
outstanding  approximately  $1,040 million of short-term  notes payable and $590
million of commercial paper. Since SOUTHERN's  construction program with respect
to major generating projects in the core business has been completed, management
believes that the need for working  capital can be  adequately  met by utilizing
lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

     See Note (D) in the "Notes to the Condensed  Financial  Statements"  herein
for discussion of financial derivative contracts entered into by SOUTHERN.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's  net income after  dividends on preferred  stock for the third quarter
and  year-to-date  1996 was $152.6  million  and $321.5  million,  respectively,
compared to $167.9 million and $322.2 million for the  corresponding  periods of
1995.  Earnings decreased by 9.1% for the third quarter,  primarily due to lower
retail energy sales, and by 0.2% year-to-date.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses  and do not affect net  income,  revenues  for the third  quarter  1996
decreased  $14.5  million,  compared to the  corresponding  period of 1995.  The
decrease in third  quarter  1996  revenues  reflects a decrease in the amount of
retail,  particularly  residential,  energy  sold as  well  as  rate  reductions
initiated by ALABAMA for certain  commercial  and industrial  customers.  Milder
weather during the third quarter of 1996 as compared to the  exceptionally  warm
summer of 1995 primarily impacted residential energy sales, which were down 7.3%
compared to the third quarter of 1995.  Commercial  energy sales increased 5.2%,
and industrial  energy sales  decreased  1.8% for the third quarter  compared to
1995. Total retail  kilowatt-hour  sales for the quarter were down 2.3% compared
to the same  period of 1995,  and  retail  revenues,  excluding  fuel  revenues,
decreased $20.1 million.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated  companies within the Southern  electric system,  as well as
purchases of energy,  will vary from period to period  depending on demand,  the
availability, and cost of generating resources at each company.

     Fuel expense. The increase in fuel expense for the year-to-date 1996 period
as  compared to the  corresponding  period of 1995 can be  attributed  to higher
generation.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Maintenance expense. Maintenance expense increased for the third quarter of
1996 compared to the same period of 1995 primarily due to a reclassification  of
expenses  previously  charged to operations  and the write-off of obsolete steam
generating plant inventory.  These items, plus an accrual to partially replenish
the natural disaster reserve, represent the primary reasons for the year-to-date
increase.

     Interest income. The 1996 year-to-date increase in interest income compared
to the same period of 1995 reflects  approximately $5 million resulting from the
recognition of gains on sales of securities  within the nuclear  decommissioning
trust.  This increase in income was offset by a concurrent  recognition of other
interest  charges in accordance with FERC  requirements.  In addition,  interest
income was reduced in May 1995, pursuant to litigation,  as a result of a charge
of $9 million to reflect the refund of interest on the sales of  merchandise  by
vendors other than ALABAMA.

     Other,  net.  The  change in this  item for the  year-to-date  1996  period
compared to the same period of 1995 is  primarily  due to a $5.6 million gain on
the  disposition  of  property  which  was  recognized  in  1995  and  increased
contributions and injuries and damages expenses during 1996.

     Amortization  of debt discount,  premium and expense,  net. The increase in
this item for the current quarter and year-to-date  periods compared to the same
periods of 1995 is the result of ALABAMA's reducing the asset account,  relating
to premiums  incurred in connection  with the  refinancing of high-cost debt, by
approximately  $5.0  million  and  $8.0  million  in  February  and  July  1996,
respectively,  as allowed by the Alabama  PSC. See Note (H) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further details.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is  positioning  the business to meet the challenge of  increasing  competition.
Legislation  has been  enacted in Alabama  that would  establish  a process  for
determining  whether  utilities  would  experience  "stranded  costs"  upon  the
transfer of an existing customer of a utility to another electric supplier. This
legislation  authorizes  the  Alabama  PSC to make a  determination  of  whether
stranded  costs  would  exist as a result of such a transfer  by a  customer  of
ALABAMA and could require the customer  seeking an  alternative  supplier to pay
any stranded costs found to exist.  The legislation  has termination  provisions
keyed  to  passage  of  comprehensive   retail  electric   service   competition
legislation which addresses  stranded costs of existing utilities and eliminates
the  obligation of utilities to provide  generating  resources.  For  additional
information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  "Competition"  and  Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS - "Future  Earnings  Potential"  of ALABAMA in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset.  For additional  information about the Clean Air Act and
other  environmental  issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (F), (G), (H) and (J) in the "Notes to
the  Condensed   Financial   Statements"   herein  for   discussion  of  various
contingencies  and other  matters which may affect  future  earnings  potential.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in ALABAMA's  financial  condition during the first nine months
of 1996 was the addition of  approximately  $325.3 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital  requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities.  See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Financing Activities

During the first quarter of 1996,  maturities and  redemptions of first mortgage
bonds of ALABAMA totaled $83.8 million.  Also,  Alabama Power Capital Trust I, a
statutory  business trust  established for the sole purpose of holding ALABAMA's
junior subordinated notes and issuing preferred  securities,  sold $97.0 million
of its 7.375% trust preferred  securities  which are guaranteed by ALABAMA.  See
Note (I) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further
details.  No additional  securities were issued,  redeemed or matured during the
second or third quarters.

     ALABAMA  has  authorized  the sale,  through a public  authority,  of $21.0
million of adjustable rate pollution  control revenue  refunding bonds due 2021.
It is expected  that proceeds from the sale of the new bonds will be applied not
later than  February 11, 1997, to the  redemption  of $21.0 million  outstanding
principal  amount of 7.40%  pollution  control  revenue  bonds  due  2016,  at a
redemption price of 102% plus accrued interest.  ALABAMA has also announced that
it  intends to redeem on January  2,  1997,  $19.8  million of its 9-1/4%  first
mortgage bonds due 2021, at par plus accrued interest, pursuant to provisions of
ALABAMA's  indenture  relating  to the  improvement  fund and use of proceeds of
released property.

     ALABAMA will continue to retire  higher-cost  debt and preferred  stock and
replace these securities with lower-cost capital, as market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS of ALABAMA
under "Capital  Requirements,"  "Other Capital  Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description  of ALABAMA's  capital  requirements
for  its  construction  program,  maturing  debt  and  environmental  compliance
efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing  activities  previously  described herein,  ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds  required for  construction  and other  purposes  from
sources  similar to those used in the past.  The amount,  type and timing of any
financings--if  needed--will  depend  upon  maintenance  of  adequate  earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
ALABAMA  expects to have adequate  earnings  coverage ratios for any anticipated
security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     To meet short-term cash needs and  contingencies,  ALABAMA had at September
30,  1996,  approximately  $20.6  million of cash and cash  equivalents  and had
committed lines of credit of approximately  $795 million (including $187 million
of  such  lines  under  which  borrowings  may be made  only  to  fund  purchase
obligations  relating to variable rate pollution  control bonds) with regulatory
authority for up to $750 million of short-term borrowing. At September 30, 1996,
ALABAMA had outstanding  $20.0 million of short-term  notes payable to banks and
$311.4 million of commercial paper. Since ALABAMA has no major generating plants
under construction, management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately  met by  utilizing  lines of credit  without  maintaining  large cash
balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying  condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of September 30, 1996, and the related condensed statements of income
for the  three-month  and nine-month  periods ended September 30, 1996 and 1995,
and  condensed  statements  of cash  flows  for  the  nine-month  periods  ended
September 30, 1996 and 1995. These financial  statements are the  responsibility
of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance  with  standards  established  by the
American  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants.  A  review  of  interim
financial  information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial  data and making  inquiries of persons  responsible  for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the  expression  of an opinion  regarding the  financial  statements  taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review,  we are not aware of any material  modifications  that
should be made to the financial  statements  referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously  audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards,  the balance  sheet of ALABAMA  POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1995
(not presented  herein) and, in our report dated February 21, 1996, we expressed
an unqualified  opinion on that statement.  In our opinion,  the information set
forth in the  accompanying  condensed  balance  sheet as of December 31, 1995 is
fairly stated, in all material  respects,  in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    THIRD QUARTER 1996 vs. THIRD QUARTER 1995

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's  net income after  dividends on preferred  stock for the third quarter
and  year-to-date  1996 was $255.5  million  and $524.2  million,  respectively,
compared to $244.7 million and $509.4 million for the  corresponding  periods of
1995.  Earnings  increased  by  4.4%  for the  quarter  primarily  due to  lower
operating and interest expenses and by 2.9%  year-to-date  primarily as a result
of increased retail revenues and lower interest costs.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses  and do not affect  income,  revenues for the third  quarter  decreased
$31.6 million and for  year-to-date  increased  $45.3  million,  compared to the
corresponding periods of 1995. The decrease in revenues for the third quarter is
primarily due to a 4.0% decrease in residential  kilowatt-hour  sales  resulting
from  milder-than-normal  weather.  Total retail  kilowatt-hour  sales increased
year-to-date primarily due to more favorable weather conditions during the first
and second  quarters of 1996 and a slight  increase  in the number of  customers
served.  Retail  revenues,  excluding  fuel  revenues,  decreased  3.1% or $30.3
million  for  the  current   quarter  and   increased   1.9%  or  $46.3  million
year-to-date.  Energy sales to non-affiliated  wholesale customers for the third
quarter 1996 compared to the same period in 1995 remained  relatively  flat, but
increased  6.5% for  year-to-date  1996 versus 1995  primarily  due to increased
demand by municipalities and cooperatives in Georgia. However, capacity revenues
from sales to  non-affiliated  utilities outside the service territory fell $0.2
million for the  quarter and $13.3  million  year-to-date  primarily  due to the
scheduled decline in megawatts of capacity under long-term contracts.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Revenues  from  affiliates.  Revenues  from sales to  affiliated  companies
within the Southern electric system,  as well as purchases of energy,  will vary
from  period to period  depending  on demand  and the  availability  and cost of
generating  resources  at  each  company.  These  transactions  do  not  have  a
significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel  expense.  Fuel  expense  decreased  primarily  due to a  decrease  in
generation resulting from the timing of maintenance at fossil and nuclear plants
and a slightly lower average cost of fuel.  (See Purchased power from affiliates
below.)

     Purchased power from  affiliates.  As a result of the timing of maintenance
at fossil and nuclear plants  discussed  above,  purchased power from affiliates
increased  compared to the same periods of 1995.  Purchased  power  transactions
among the affiliated  companies  within the Southern  electric  system will vary
from  period to period  depending  on demand  and the  availability  and cost of
generating  resources  at  each  company.  These  transactions  do  not  have  a
significant impact on earnings.

     Provision for separation benefits. The increase in provision for separation
benefits for each period is attributable to work force reduction programs, which
have been implemented to control growth in future operating  expenses.  See Note
(G) in the "Notes to the  Condensed  Financial  Statements"  herein for  further
details.

     Other operation  expense.  The decrease in other operation  expense for the
current  quarter and  year-to-date  is primarily due to a charge in July 1995 of
$21.8 million of  demand-side  option  program costs not collected  through rate
riders  (see  Note (O) in the  "Notes  to the  Condensed  Financial  Statements"
herein)  and a charge in August  1995 of $12.6  million  of  Nuclear  Regulatory
Commission mandated study costs,  partially offset by increased cost under a new
three-year retail rate plan effective January 1, 1996.

     Depreciation  and  amortization  expense.  The decrease in depreciation and
amortization  for the  current  quarter  compared  to the same period of 1995 is
primarily due to a $15.3  million  charge to  amortization  expense in September
1995 for software  development  costs.  Depreciation and amortization  increased
year-to-date  1996 compared to  year-to-date  1995  primarily due to accelerated
depreciation  of generating  plant  pursuant to a new retail rate plan effective
January 1, 1996, and an increase in plant-in-service.

     Other,  net and Income taxes  applicable to other  income.  For the current
quarter,  the change in each of these items is primarily  the result of expenses
incurred in connection with activities related to the 1996 Summer Olympic games.
For the year-to-date  period, the primary reason for the change in each of these
items is the  completion  of the sale,  in June 1995,  of Plant  Scherer Unit 4,
which resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $12.0 million.

     Interest on  long-term  debt.  The decline in  interest on  long-term  debt
reflects the redemption and refinancing of long-term debt.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors  ranging from energy sales growth to movement  towards a less regulated,
more competitive environment.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional  information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Competition"  and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in
the Form 10-K.

     Effective  January 1, 1996,  GEORGIA  began  operating  under a  three-year
retail rate plan. Under the plan, GEORGIA's earnings will be evaluated against a
retail  return on common  equity  range of 10% to 12.5%.  GEORGIA is required to
absorb cost increases of approximately  $29.0 million annually during the plan's
three-year   operation,   including   $14.0  million   annually  of  accelerated
depreciation of electric  plant.  Reference is made to Note (L) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset.  For additional  information about the Clean Air Act and
other  environmental  issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (B),  (C), (F) and (L) through (R) in the "Notes
to  the  Condensed  Financial  Statements"  herein  for  discussion  of  various
contingencies  and other  matters which may affect  future  earnings  potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's  financial  condition during the first nine months
of 1996 was the addition of approximately $328.2 million to utility plant. These
additions were primarily related to transmission and distribution facilities and
to the purchase of nuclear fuel. The funds for these additions and other capital
requirements  were derived  primarily from operations.  See GEORGIA's  Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first quarter of 1996,  $150.0  million of GEORGIA's  first  mortgage
bonds matured,  and GEORGIA sold $10.0 million of medium-term notes and redeemed
$6.8  million of  industrial  development  bonds.  In June 1996,  GEORGIA  sold,
through a public  authority,  $51.3 million of variable rate  pollution  control
revenue  bonds,  and the proceeds were applied to the redemption on July 1, 1996
of $51.3 million outstanding principal amount of 7.25% pollution control revenue
bonds. In August 1996, Georgia Power Capital Trust I, a statutory business trust
established for the sole purpose of holding GEORGIA's junior  subordinated notes
and  issuing  preferred  securities,  sold  $225.0  million  of its 7.75%  trust
preferred  securities,  which are  guaranteed  by GEORGIA.  (See Note (K) in the
"Notes to the Condensed  Financial  Statements"  herein for further details.) In
September  1996,  GEORGIA sold,  through  public  authorities,  $61.5 million of
variable rate  pollution  control  revenue bonds due 2026, and the proceeds were
applied  to the  redemption  on  October  1, 1996 of $61.5  million  outstanding
principal  amount of 6-3/8% to 8% pollution  control revenue bonds.  Also during
the third quarter 1996,  GEORGIA  redeemed $78.9 million of preferred  stock and
$60.9 million of first mortgage bonds.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     On November 2, 1996,  GEORGIA  redeemed  all of its  4,000,000  outstanding
shares of $2.125  preferred  stock at the redemption  price of $25.00 per share,
plus accrued  dividends.  GEORGIA plans to continue,  to the extent possible,  a
program  to  retire  higher-cost  debt and  preferred  stock and  replace  these
securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital  Requirements"  and  "Environmental  Issues" in the
Form  10-K  for  a  description  of  GEORGIA's  capital   requirements  for  its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing  activities  previously  described herein,  GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds  required for  construction  and other  purposes  from
sources  similar to those used in the past.  The amount,  type and timing of any
financings--if  needed--will  depend  upon  maintenance  of  adequate  earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
GEORGIA  expects to have adequate  earnings  coverage ratios for any anticipated
security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and  contingencies,  GEORGIA had at September
30,  1996,  approximately  $30.7  million  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and
approximately $854.7 million of unused credit arrangements with banks (including
$589.7 million of such  arrangements  under which borrowings may be made only to
fund purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds). At
September 30, 1996,  GEORGIA had  outstanding  $1.3 million of short-term  notes
payable to banks and $100.9  million of commercial  paper.  Since GEORGIA has no
major generating plants under  construction,  management  believes that the need
for working  capital can be adequately met by utilizing  lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying  condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia  corporation)  as of  September  30,  1996,  and the  related
condensed  statements of income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 1996 and 1995, and the condensed  statements of cash flows for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 1996 and 1995. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance  with  standards  established  by the
American  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants.  A  review  of  interim
financial  information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial  data and making  inquiries of persons  responsible  for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the  expression  of an opinion  regarding the  financial  statements  taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review,  we are not aware of any material  modifications  that
should be made to the financial  statements  referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously  audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards,  the balance  sheet of GEORGIA  POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1995
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 21, 1996, we expressed
an unqualified  opinion on that statement.  In our opinion,  the information set
forth in the  accompanying  condensed  balance sheet as of December 31, 1995, is
fairly stated, in all material  respects,  in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after  dividends on preferred  stock for the third quarter and
year-to-date 1996 was $23.7 million and $47.6 million, respectively, compared to
$26.6 million and $51.6 million for the corresponding  periods of 1995. Earnings
decreased by 10.8% for the quarter  primarily due to lower  revenues as a result
of this year's  milder summer  temperatures  compared to the  exceptionally  hot
summer of 1995 and due to increased other operation expense.  Earnings decreased
by 7.8% year-to-date primarily due to higher operation and maintenance expenses.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the

     Revenues.  Of the $16.5  million  increase in revenues  year-to-date  1996,
approximately $6.9 million impacted earnings.  Territorial  revenues,  excluding
those  revenues  which  represent the  pass-through  of fuel expense and certain
other expenses and do not affect income, increased $4.9 million. The increase in
territorial  revenues for the current  year-to-date  period was  influenced by a
2.6% increase in retail kilowatt-hour sales compared to the same period of 1995.
This change in  year-to-date  retail  energy  sales is  primarily  due to higher
residential  and  commercial  sales as a  result  of  colder-than-normal  winter
weather during the first quarter of 1996 and a slight  increase in the number of
customers  served.  Industrial  sales  were  up  for  the  current  quarter  and
year-to-date periods while industrial revenues were down for the current quarter
and  year-to-date  periods,  compared to a year ago,  primarily due to increased
participation  in the  Real-Time-Pricing  program.  See  Item  7 -  MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future  Earnings  Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K
for information on initiatives to remain  competitive  and to meet  conservation
goals set by the Florida PSC.

     Revenues  from  affiliates.  Revenues  from sales to  affiliated  companies
within the Southern electric system,  as well as purchases of energy,  will vary
from  period to period  depending  on demand  and the  availability  and cost of
generating  resources  at  each  company.  These  transactions  do  not  have  a
significant impact on earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased  power from  affiliates.  The  reduction in purchased  power from
affiliates for the current  quarter,  compared to one year ago, is primarily due
to increased  availability  of GULF's  generating  units.  Purchased  power from
affiliates  was  higher  for  the  year-to-date  1996  period  compared  to  the
corresponding period of 1995 due to maintenance outages at Plant Crist and Plant
Daniel during the first half of 1996.  Purchased  power  transactions  among the
affiliated  companies within the Southern  electric system will vary from period
to  period  depending  on demand  and the  availability  and cost of  generating
resources at each company.  These  transactions do not have a significant impact
on earnings.

     Other operation  expense.  Other operation  expense increased for the third
quarter  and   year-to-date   1996   primarily   due  to  increases  in  various
administrative and general expenses,  including expenses related to the approved
increase of GULF's  annual  accrual to the  accumulated  provision  for property
damage to amortize  deferred storm charges and restore the account  balance to a
reasonable  level.  For  additional  information  regarding  the  provision  for
property  damage,  see Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings  Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K.  Costs associated with work force
reduction  programs  also  contributed  to the  year-to-date  increase  in other
operation  expense.  For additional  information  regarding work force reduction
programs,  see Note (G) in the  "Notes to the  Condensed  Financial  Statements"
herein.

     Maintenance expense. The fluctuation in maintenance expense for the quarter
and  year-to-date  periods is primarily due to the  scheduling of maintenance on
production facilities.  The increase in maintenance expense for the year-to-date
1996 period compared to 1995 is primarily  attributable to scheduled maintenance
performed at Plant Crist and Plant Daniel during the first half of 1996.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition.  On
September  3,  1996,   the  Florida  PSC  approved   GULF's   petition  for  the
Commercial/Industrial   Service   Rider   (CISR)   to   be   implemented   on  a
pilot/experimental  basis. The CISR will allow GULF the flexibility to negotiate
prices  and other  terms of service  with its large  commercial  and  industrial
customers who have  competitive  alternatives  to taking  electric  service from
GULF.  For  additional  information,  see Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS  "Future  Earnings   Potential"  of  GULF  and  Item  1  -  BUSINESS  -
"Competition" in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's environmental cost recovery clause.
For  additional  information  about the  Clean  Air Act and other  environmental
issues,  see Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS -  "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     Reference  is made to  Notes  (B) and (F) in the  "Notes  to the  Condensed
Financial  Statements" herein for discussion of various  contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GULF's  financial  condition during the first nine months of
1996 was the addition of approximately $49.7 million to utility plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital  requirements  were derived primarily from
operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first half of 1996,  GULF sold $30.0 million of first mortgage bonds;
sold,  through public  authorities,  $33.3 million of pollution  control revenue
refunding  bonds and issued a $22.1 million bank note. GULF retired $1.8 million
of first mortgage bonds,  redeemed $12.075 million of pollution  control revenue
bonds,  redeemed $21.2 million of pollution  control revenue refunding bonds and
retired a $25.0  million  bank  note.  No  additional  securities  were  issued,
redeemed or matured during the third quarter.

     On November 6, 1996,  GULF entered into an agreement to sell $25.0  million
of 6-1/2% first mortgage bonds due 2006, and it is expected that delivery of the
bonds will be made on November 20, 1996.  Also, on November 20, 1996, GULF plans
to issue a $27.0  million bank note due 1999.  The proceeds from the sale of the
bonds  together  with  the  bank  borrowings  will  be  applied  by  GULF to the
redemption in December 1996 of the $49.2 million outstanding principal amount of
its 8-3/4% first mortgage bonds due 2021.  Such  redemption is subject to GULF's
closing the sale of the bonds and effecting the bank  borrowings.  GULF plans to
continue,  to the  extent  possible,  a program to retire  higher-cost  debt and
preferred stock and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.  Under the
terms of GULF's  supplemental  indenture  dated as of January 1, 1996,  retained
earnings of $127 million were  restricted  against the payment of cash dividends
on common stock at September 30, 1996.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital  Requirements  for  Construction,"  "Environmental  Matters" and "Other
Capital  Requirements"  in the Form 10-K for a  description  of  GULF's  capital
requirements for its construction program,  environmental compliance efforts and
maturing debt. GULF's capital requirements for its construction program for 1996
through  1998 were  reduced in October  1996 by $52 million due to various  cost
reduction initiatives.  GULF's gross property additions, including those amounts
related to environmental  compliance,  are now budgeted at $157 million for 1996
through 1998 ($61 million in 1996, $47 million in 1997 and $49 million in 1998).
Approximately  $40.8 million will be required  through  September 30, 1997,  for
maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities  previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds  required for  construction  and other purposes from sources
similar  to  those  used  in the  past.  The  amount,  type  and  timing  of any
financings--if  needed--will  depend  upon  maintenance  of  adequate  earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
GULF  expects to have  adequate  earnings  coverage  ratios for any  anticipated
security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies,  GULF had at September 30,
1996,  approximately $6.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $49.3 million
of  unused  committed  lines of  credit  with  banks  (including  $20.3  million
liquidity  support for variable rate pollution  control bonds). At September 30,
1996, GULF had outstanding  $37.5 million of short-term  notes payable to banks.
Since  GULF  has no  major  generating  plants  under  construction,  management
believes that the need for working  capital can be  adequately  met by utilizing
lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's  net  income  after  dividends  on  preferred  stock for the third
quarter and year-to-date 1996 was $21.8 million and $44.9 million, respectively,
compared to $22.2  million and $46.2  million for the  corresponding  periods of
1995. The 1.7% decrease in earnings for the current quarter was primarily due to
a decrease in revenues  and an increase in  operating  expenses.  An increase in
operating expenses also affected  year-to-date  results as evidenced by the 2.8%
decrease in earnings compared to prior year.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the

</TABLE>

     Revenues.  For the quarter and year-to-date  periods,  compared to one year
ago,  the  changes in  revenues  are due  primarily  to changes in the amount of
retail energy sold.  Retail  kilowatt-hour  sales decreased 0.3% for the quarter
and increased 3.8% year to date. Retail revenues, excluding those revenues which
represent  the  recovery of fuel expense and certain  other  expenses and do not
affect income, decreased $1.4 million for the quarter and increased $5.8 million
year to date.  The  changes in retail  sales for the  quarter  and  year-to-date
periods were primarily affected by favorable weather extremes experienced in the
summer  of 1995 and in the  first  half of  1996,  respectively.  For the  third
quarter,  sales to territorial wholesale customers were only slightly lower than
in 1995. For the year-to-date period,  sales to territorial  wholesale customers
were positively  impacted by favorable weather during the first half of 1996 and
customer  growth.   Year-to-date   1996  revenues  from  territorial   wholesale
customers,  excluding fuel revenues  which do not affect income,  increased $4.5
million compared to the same period of 1995, with an increase in energy sales of
7.4%.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated  companies within the Southern  electric system,  as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability   and  cost  of  generating   resources  at  each  company.   These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

                            MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel  expense.  The  increase  in fuel  expense  for the third  quarter and
year-to-date  1996 as  compared  to the  corresponding  periods  of 1995  can be
attributed  to  higher  generation  due  to  increased  kilowatt-hour  sales  to
affiliated companies.

     Purchased  power from  non-affiliates.  The  increase  in this item for the
current quarter and  year-to-date  periods results  primarily from the purchase,
beginning in June 1996, of capacity and energy from another utility as discussed
later under "Future Earnings Potential."

     Maintenance  expense.  The increase in maintenance  expense for the current
quarter is primarily  attributable  to  maintenance  performed at two generating
plants/units  during the third  quarter of 1996.  Maintenance  performed  at two
generating  plants during the first and second quarters of 1996 also contributed
to the increase in  maintenance  expense for the 1996  year-to-date  period.  In
1995,  maintenance  normally  performed  during the first  quarter was postponed
until the fourth quarter.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. Additional plant investment,  higher
depreciation  rates beginning in 1996, and increased  amortization of regulatory
assets,  primarily  those  assets  related  to the ECO plan,  accounted  for the
increases in this item.

     Interest on  long-term  debt.  The decline in  interest on  long-term  debt
reflects the redemption and refinancing of long-term debt.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.  Operating  revenues will be affected by any changes in rates under
the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing  force on electric
rates,   with  only  moderate   changes  in  rates  taking  place.   Based  upon
MISSISSIPPI's semi-annual PEP evaluation for the period ended June 30, 1996, the
Mississippi  PSC approved a retail  revenue  increase of $4.5 million  (1.06% of
annual retail revenue), effective October 1996. MISSISSIPPI's 1996 annual filing
under the ECO plan with the  Mississippi  PSC  resulted  in an  approved  annual
revenue requirement decrease of $3.0 million, effective April 1996.

     MISSISSIPPI  has entered into  agreements to purchase  summer peaking power
and  options  for  power for the  years  1996  through  2000.  For June  through
September of 1996, MISSISSIPPI entered into an agreement to buy 242 megawatts of
capacity  and  energy  from  another  electric  utility.  For each June  through
September  period of 1997 through 2000,  MISSISSIPPI has purchased  options from
power  marketers for up to 250 megawatts of peaking power in 1997; 300 megawatts
in 1998;  350 megawatts in 1999;  and 400  megawatts in 2000. In June 1996,  the
Mississippi  PSC  approved  MISSISSIPPI's  request  that it be allowed to earn a
return on the capacity portion of these agreements.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional  information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Competition"  and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S   DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  -  "Future   Earnings   Potential"  of

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered.  For additional  information  about the Clean Air Act
and  other  environmental  issues,  see  Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (F) and (G) in the "Notes to the  Condensed
Financial  Statements" herein for discussion of various  contingencies and other
matters which may affect future  earnings  potential.  Reference is also made to
Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major  change in  MISSISSIPPI's  financial  condition  during the first nine
months of 1996 was the addition of approximately $43.9 million to utility plant.
The funds for  these  additions  and other  capital  requirements  were  derived
primarily from operations and an increase in short-term debt. See  MISSISSIPPI's
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During  the  first  half of  1996,  $20.0  million  in bank  notes  matured  and
MISSISSIPPI issued a $30.0 million bank note and redeemed $45.4 million of first
mortgage bonds. No additional securities were issued, redeemed or matured during
the third quarter.

     MISSISSIPPI plans to continue,  to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost   debt  and  preferred  stock  and  replace  these  securities  with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference  is  made  to  Item  7  -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  of
MISSISSIPPI  under  "Capital  Requirements  for  Construction,"   "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital  Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of
MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its construction  program,  environmental
compliance efforts,  sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt.
Through  September  30, 1997,  approximately  $35.0 million will be required for
maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds  required for  construction  and other  purposes  from
sources  similar to those used in the past.  The amount,  type and timing of any
financings--if  needed--will  depend  upon  maintenance  of  adequate  earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
MISSISSIPPI   expects  to  have  adequate   earnings  coverage  ratios  for  any
anticipated  security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS -
"Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     To  meet  short-term  cash  needs  and  contingencies,  MISSISSIPPI  had at
September 30, 1996,  approximately $1.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately  $96.3 million of unused committed credit  arrangements with banks
(including $10.8 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made
only to fund purchase  obligations  relating to variable rate pollution  control
bonds).  At September 30, 1996,  MISSISSIPPI  had  outstanding  $16.5 million of
short-term  notes payable to banks.  Since  MISSISSIPPI has no major  generating
plants under construction, management believes that the need for working capital
can be adequately  met by utilizing  lines of credit without  maintaining  large
cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's  earnings for the quarter and  year-to-date  periods  remained fairly
constant compared to the corresponding  periods of 1995,  increasing by 1.0% and
1.2%, respectively. SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for
the third quarter and  year-to-date  1996 was $12.8  million and $21.4  million,
respectively,  compared to $12.7 million and $21.2 million for the corresponding
periods of 1995.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the

</TABLE>

         Revenues.  Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of
fuel expenses and do not affect income, revenues for the quarter remained fairly
constant,  while revenues  year-to-date 1996 increased  approximately  $227,000,
compared to the  corresponding  periods of 1995.  The  increase in  year-to-date
revenues was due  primarily to an increase in the amount of retail  energy sold.
Year-to-date 1996 total retail  kilowatt-hour sales increased 2.1% over the same
period  of  1995,  and  retail  revenues,  excluding  fuel  revenues,  increased
approximately  $1.0 million. A slight increase in the number of customers served
coupled with increased usage per customer  accounted for most of the increase in
residential  and  commercial  demand;   however,   kilowatt-hour  sales  to  the
industrial  sector  were down  primarily  due to a reduction  in the  production
schedule of one of SAVANNAH's major industrial customers.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated  companies within the Southern  electric system,  as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability   and  cost  of  generating   resources  at  each  company.   These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel  expense.  The  decrease in fuel  expense  for the current  quarter as
compared  to the  same  period  of 1995 is  primarily  attributable  to a timing
difference  in  accrual  of gas  invoices.  The  increase  in fuel  expense  for
year-to-date  1996 as compared to year-to-date  1995 can be attributed to higher
generation  necessary to meet the increased  demand for electricity and a higher
average cost of fuel.

     Other,  net. For the current  quarter  compared to the same period of 1995,
the  change in this item is  primarily  due to  employee  stock  ownership  plan
contributions  in  September  1996  versus  October  1995 and due to the sale of
timber in 1995. The year-to-date change in this item is attributable to the same
factors affecting the third quarter as well as the  discontinuation of incentive
revenues under the demand-side  option program  effective  October 1, 1995. (For
additional  information about the demand-side option program,  reference is made
to Note (S) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein.)

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional  information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Competition"  and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings  Potential" of SAVANNAH
in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset.  For additional  information about the Clean Air Act and
other  environmental  issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     Reference  is made to  Notes  (B) and (T) in the  "Notes  to the  Condensed
Financial  Statements" herein for discussion of various  contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in SAVANNAH's  financial condition during the first nine months
of 1996 was the addition of  approximately  $21.1 million to utility plant.  The
funds for these additions and other capital  requirements were derived primarily
from operations.  See SAVANNAH's  Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

During the first  quarter of 1996,  SAVANNAH  retired $1.2 million of its 9 3/8%
first  mortgage  bonds  to meet  sinking  fund  requirements  and  entered  into
arrangements  with the Savannah Economic  Development  Authority to provide $7.0
million for the financing of a new coal handling facility at Plant Kraft. During
the second quarter,  SAVANNAH issued $20.0 million of 6.90% first mortgage bonds
due 2006 and a $10.0 million 6.88% bank note due 2001. The proceeds were used to
redeem on July 1, 1996 all remaining outstanding 9 3/8% first mortgage bonds due
2021. No additional securities were issued, redeemed or matured during the third
quarter. SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for  construction and other purposes
from sources  similar to those used in the past. The amount,  type and timing of
any  financings--if  needed--will  depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
SAVANNAH expects to have adequate  earnings  coverage ratios for any anticipated
security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies,  SAVANNAH had at September
30,  1996,   approximately  $1.7  million  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and
approximately  $39.0  million  of unused  credit  arrangements  with  banks.  At
September  30, 1996,  SAVANNAH had $1.5 million of  short-term  notes payable to
banks.  Since  SAVANNAH  has no  major  generating  plants  under  construction,
management  believes that the need for working  capital can be adequately met by
utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)  The condensed financial  statements of the registrants included herein have
     been prepared by each registrant,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and
     regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of each registrant's management, the
     information   regarding  such  registrant  furnished  herein  reflects  all
     adjustments (which included only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to
     present  fairly the results for the periods  ended  September  30, 1996 and
     1995.  Certain  information and footnote  disclosures  normally included in
     financial   statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
     accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules
     and  regulations,  although each  registrant  believes that the disclosures
     regarding such  registrant are adequate to make the  information  presented
     not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed financial  statements
     be read in conjunction with the financial  statements and the notes thereto
     included in each  registrant's  latest annual report on Form 10-K.  Certain
     prior-period  amounts have been reclassified to conform with current-period
     presentation.

         The  condensed  financial  statements  of ALABAMA and GEORGIA  included
     herein have been  reviewed by ALABAMA's and  GEORGIA's  independent  public
     accountants as set forth in their reports  included  herein as Exhibit 1 to
     ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)  SOUTHERN's  operating  affiliates  are  subject to the  provisions  of FASB
     Statement  No.  71,   Accounting  for  the  Effects  of  Certain  Types  of
     Regulation.  In the event that a portion of a  company's  operations  is no
     longer subject to these provisions,  the company would be required to write
     off related  regulatory assets and liabilities,  and determine if any other
     assets have been impaired.  For additional  information,  see Note 1 to the
     financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(C)  The  staff of the SEC has  questioned  certain  of the  current  accounting
     practices of the electric utility industry--including SOUTHERN's--regarding
     the recognition,  measurement and classification of  decommissioning  costs
     for nuclear generating facilities in the financial statements.  In response
     to these  questions,  the FASB has  decided  to review the  accounting  for
     liabilities related to closure and removal of long-lived assets,  including
     nuclear  decommissioning.  Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
     ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN,  ALABAMA and GEORGIA in
     Item 7 and Note 1 to the  financial  statements  of  SOUTHERN,  ALABAMA and
     GEORGIA under  "Depreciation and Nuclear  Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the
     Form 10-K.

(D)  The SOUTHERN system utilizes certain financial  derivative contracts solely
     for the  purpose  of  risk  management.  The  companies'  participation  in
     derivative contracts has been to hedge business exposure in connection with
     Southern  Energy  activities to  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
     currency  exchange  rates. At September 30, 1996, the status of outstanding
     derivative contracts was as follows:

                                    Maturity or        Notional      Unrealized
                  Type              Termination         Amount       Gain (Loss)
                  ----              -----------        --------      -----------

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(E)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item
     8 of the Form  10-K  for a  description  of the  proceedings  related  to a
     derivative  action filed against certain  current and former  directors and
     officers of SOUTHERN. In May 1996, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
     the 11th Circuit  affirmed the trial  court's  dismissal of this suit.  The
     plaintiffs'  subsequent  request for rehearing by the full appellate  court

     return on common  equity  on  certain  of the  Southern  electric  system's
     wholesale rate schedules and contracts.

(H)  In June  1995,  the  Alabama  PSC issued a rate  order  granting  ALABAMA's
     request  for  gradual  adjustments  to move toward  parity  among  customer
     classes. This order also calls for a moratorium on any periodic retail rate
     increases  (but not  decreases)  until July 2001.  In  December  1995,  the
     Alabama PSC issued an order  authorizing  ALABAMA to reduce  balance  sheet
     items--such as plant and deferred  charges--at  any time  ALABAMA's  actual
     base rate revenues exceed the budgeted revenues.  Reference is made to Note
     3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form
     10-K for additional information.

(I)  In January 1996,  Alabama Power  Capital  Trust I (the  "Trust"),  of which
     ALABAMA  owns all the  common  securities,  issued  $97  million  of 7.375%
     mandatorily  redeemable  preferred  securities.  Substantially  all  of the
     assets  of the  Trust  are  $100  million  aggregate  principal  amount  of
     ALABAMA's  7.375%  Junior  Subordinated  Notes due March 31, 2026.  ALABAMA
     considers  that the mechanisms  and  obligations  relating to the preferred
     securities,  taken together,  constitute a full and unconditional guarantee
     by ALABAMA of the Trust's payment obligations with respect to the preferred
     securities.

(J)  Actions  against  ALABAMA  have been filed in several  counties  in Alabama
     charging  ALABAMA with fraud and  non-compliance  with regulatory  statutes
     relating to the offer, sale and financing of "extended  service  contracts"
     in  connection  with the sale of electric  appliances.  Some of these cases
     have been filed as class actions, while others have been filed on behalf of
     multiple individual plaintiffs. The plaintiffs in these actions seek

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


     damages in an  unspecified  amount.  ALABAMA has offered  extended  service
     agreements to its customers since January 1984, and  approximately  175,000
     extended  service  agreements could be involved in these  proceedings.  The
     final outcome of these cases cannot now be determined.

(K)  In August 1996,  Georgia  Power  Capital  Trust I (the  "Trust"),  of which
     GEORGIA  owns all the  common  securities,  issued  $225  million  of 7.75%
     mandatorily  redeemable  preferred  securities.  Substantially  all  of the
     assets  of the  Trust  are  $232  million  aggregate  principal  amount  of
     GEORGIA's  7.75%  Junior  Subordinated  Notes  due June 30,  2036.  GEORGIA
     considers  that the mechanisms  and  obligations  relating to the preferred
     securities,  taken together,  constitute a full and unconditional guarantee
     by GEORGIA of the Trust's payment obligations with respect to the preferred
     securities. Reference is also made to Note 9 to the financial statements of
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(L)  On February  16, 1996,  the Georgia PSC  approved a three-year  retail rate
     plan for GEORGIA  effective  January 1, 1996. For  additional  information,
     reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA  in Item 8 of the Form  10-K.  In  November  1996,  on  appeal by a
     consumer group, the Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia)  reversed the
     order of the Georgia PSC approving the rate plan and remanded the matter to
     the Georgia PSC. The court found that statutory requirements  applicable to
     rate cases  should have been,  but were not,  followed.  GEORGIA  currently
     intends to appeal the court's decision.

(M)  Pursuant to orders from the Georgia PSC,  GEORGIA  deferred  financing  and
     depreciation  costs under  phase-in  plans for Plant  Vogtle  Units 1 and 2
     until the allowed  investment  was fully  reflected  in rates as of October
     1991. In addition,  the Georgia PSC issued two separate  accounting  orders
     that required  GEORGIA to defer  substantially  all operating and financing
     costs related to both units until rate orders  addressed  these costs.  The
     Georgia PSC orders  provide for recovery of deferred costs within 10 years.
     The Georgia PSC also ordered GEORGIA to levelize declining capacity buyback
     expense from the  co-owners of the plant over a six-year  period  beginning
     October 1991. The unamortized  balance of these deferred costs at September
     30, 1996, was $206.6 million. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements
     of  SOUTHERN  and  GEORGIA,  respectively,  in Item 8 of the Form  10-K for
     additional information.

(N)  Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information  concerning the recovery
     by GEORGIA of its costs  associated  with the Rocky Mountain pumped storage
     hydroelectric plant.

(O)  Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for  information  regarding  recovery by
     GEORGIA  of  its  costs  associated  with  its   discontinued   demand-side
     conservation programs.

(P)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial  statements of GEORGIA in Item
     8 of the Form 10-K for information  concerning a joint complaint filed with
     the FERC by OPC and MEAG seeking  recovery of alleged partial  requirements
     rates  overcharges and the order of the FERC dismissing such complaint.  In
     June 1996, the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  Circuit
     vacated the FERC's  order  insofar as it denied  OPC's claim for a share of
     the settlement  proceeds that GEORGIA  received from Gulf States  Utilities
     Company and remanded the case to the FERC.

(Q)  In May 1996, MEAG filed a complaint with the FERC seeking termination as of
     December  31, 1996 of the  partial  requirements  tariff  pursuant to which
     GEORGIA  currently sells wholesale energy to MEAG. The complaint also seeks
     refunds  in an  unspecified  amount as a result of alleged  overcharges  by
     GEORGIA  under the tariff for the years 1993,  1994,  1995 and 1996. In its
     response,  filed with the FERC in June 1996, GEORGIA also requests that its
     partial  requirements  service  obligation  to MEAG be terminated as of the
     date  sought by MEAG.  GEORGIA  further  denies  that any refund is owed to
     MEAG.

(R)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA  in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for  information  regarding  GEORGIA's
      designation  as a potentially  responsible  party under the  Comprehensive
      Environmental   Response,   Compensation   and  Liability  Act  and  other
      environmental contingencies.

(S)   Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SAVANNAH in
      Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding SAVANNAH's  discontinued
      demand-side conservation programs. In May and June 1996, SAVANNAH refunded
      to  customers  a total  of  $266,000,  which is the  amount  that had been
      overcollected from demand-side rate riders as of December 31, 1995.

(T)   SAVANNAH is currently  undergoing  an earnings  review by the Georgia PSC,
      and to date, the Georgia PSC has made no determination.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1.   Legal Proceedings.

          (1)  Reference  is  made  to  the  Notes  to the  Condensed  Financial
               Statements  herein for  information  regarding  certain legal and
               administrative  proceedings  in which  SOUTHERN and its reporting
               subsidiaries are involved.

          (2)  Reference is made to Item 3 - LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS in the Form 10-K
               for information  regarding a tax deficiency  notice received from
               the Internal Revenue Service relating to GEORGIA's tax accounting
               for the sale in 1984 of an interest  in Plant  Vogtle and related
               capacity and energy buyback commitments.

          (3)  Reference is made to Item 3 - LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS in the Form 10-K
               for information regarding an action filed by ALABAMA, GEORGIA and
               MISSISSIPPI  in January  1996 which  seeks to enjoin the TVA from
               violating a 1959 act that  prohibits  the TVA from selling  power
               outside the area that was being  served by it in 1957.  On August
               28, 1996, the U.S.  District  Court for the Northern  District of
               ALABAMA granted a summary  judgment in favor of ALABAMA,  GEORGIA
               and  MISSISSIPPI,  finding  that the LG&E Power  Marketing  (LPM)
               contract was unlawful.  It is not currently  known whether TVA or
               LPM will appeal this judgment.
