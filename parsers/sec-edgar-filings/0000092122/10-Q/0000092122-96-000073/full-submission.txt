                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1996 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1995


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SOUTHERN's  consolidated  net  income  for the  first  quarter  of 1996 was $233
million  ($0.35 per share),  compared to $206 million  ($0.31 per share) for the
same quarter of 1995, representing a 12.9% increase.  Colder-than-normal weather
during the first three months of 1996  increased the demand for  electricity  by
residential and commercial  customers which positively  affected earnings of the
core  business.  Compared to the first quarter of 1995,  core business  earnings
increased 6.9% or $14 million.  The  performance of the non-core  portion of the
business (primarily  resulting from the acquisition of SWEB in the third quarter
of 1995) also  contributed to the  improvement  in 1996 earnings.  (Reference is
made to Note 14 of  SOUTHERN's  financial  statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K
for additional information regarding the acquisition of SWEB.)

     SOUTHERN's core business is its five electric utility operating  companies,
which provide electric service in four Southeastern states. The non-core portion
of the  business  is  primarily  represented  by SEI,  which  owns  and  manages
international and domestic  businesses for SOUTHERN.  Businesses acquired by SEI
have been  included in the  consolidated  statements of income since the date of
acquisition.  Certain changes in operating  revenues and expenses from the prior
period are the result of such acquisitions.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the
following:

                                                     Increase (Decrease)
                                             -----------------------------------
                                             (in thousands)              %
Operating revenues...........................   $486,575                25.2
Fuel expense.................................     52,846                11.7
Purchased power expense......................    212,959               363.8
Maintenance expense..........................     26,965                16.9
Depreciation and amortization expense........     32,524                15.3
Taxes other than income taxes................     45,197                36.6
Interest on long-term debt...................      3,370                 2.5
Interest on notes payable....................      8,949                65.8


     Operating revenues. The increase in operating revenues of the core business
was influenced  most heavily by an increase in the amount of retail energy sold.
For the first three months of 1996, total retail  kilowatt-hour  sales increased
8.0% over the same period of 1995.  Retail  revenues,  excluding  those revenues
which represent the  pass-through of fuel expense and certain other expenses and
do not  affect  income,  increased  $69  million.  Residential,  commercial  and
industrial energy sales increased 13.0%, 10.4% and 3.0%, respectively, primarily
due to colder  temperatures  and an increase in the number of customers  served.
Weather was also a factor in increased  wholesale  energy  sales,  which were up
28.5% compared to the corresponding  period of 1995. However,  capacity revenues
from  off-system  sales were down $17  million  primarily  due to the  scheduled
decline in megawatts of capacity under long-term contracts compared to the first
quarter of 1995.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel  expense.  Fuel expense in the core business rose 10.9% or $48 million
compared to the same period of 1995 primarily due to higher generation necessary
to meet the increased  demand for  electricity,  partially  offset by a slightly
lower average cost of fuel.

     Purchased  power  expense.  The  substantial  increase in  purchased  power
expense is attributable to non-core operations, specifically, SWEB's operations.
(SWEB's main  business is the  distribution  of  electricity.  It must  purchase
essentially all of its power.) Purchased power expense increased only 4.9% or $2
million in the core business.

     Maintenance  expense.  Maintenance  expense  related  to the core  business
increased  $12 million or 7.6%  compared to the first quarter of 1995 due to the
timing of scheduled maintenance performed on generating units.

     Depreciation  and  amortization  expense.   Depreciation  and  amortization
expense in the core business  increased $17 million or 8.3% compared to the same
period of 1995 mainly due to accelerated  depreciation of generating  plants and
additional plant investment.

     Taxes other than income  taxes.  For the first three months of 1996,  taxes
other than income taxes associated with the core business increased $10 million,
a 7.9%  increase,  compared to the same quarter of 1995  primarily due to higher
municipal and county franchise taxes resulting from increased sales.

     Interest on long-term  debt.  The increase in interest on long-term debt is
attributable  to non-core  business  activities.  In the first  quarter of 1996,
interest on long-term  debt in the core business  decreased $29 million  (23.2%)
compared to the  corresponding  period of 1995  reflecting  the  redemption  and
refinancing of long-term debt by the operating companies.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment, with non-core business becoming more significant.

     With respect to non-core activities,  SOUTHERN received,  in April 1996, an
order from the SEC which in effect allows it to use the proceeds from financings
to  increase  its  aggregate  investment  in EWGs and FUCOs up to an amount  not
exceeding 100% of SOUTHERN's  consolidated retained earnings. At March 31, 1996,
SOUTHERN's  consolidated  retained earnings amounted to $3,505 million,  and its
aggregate  investment in EWGs and FUCOs amounted to $934 million. For additional
information  relating to SOUTHERN's non-core business  activities,  see Item 1 -
BUSINESS - "New Business Development" in the Form 10-K.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is  positioning  the business to meet the challenge of  increasing  competition.
Legislation  has been  enacted in Alabama  that would  establish  a process  for
determining  whether  utilities  would  experience  "stranded  costs"  upon  the
transfer of an existing customer of a utility to another electric supplier. This
legislation  authorizes  the  Alabama  PSC to make a  determination  of  whether
stranded  costs  would  exist as a result of such a transfer  by a  customer  of
ALABAMA and would require the customer  seeking an  alternative  supplier to pay
any stranded costs found to exist.  The legislation  has termination  provisions
keyed  to  passage  of  comprehensive   retail  electric   service   competition
legislation which addresses stranded costs of existing utilities and eliminates

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first three months
of 1996 was the addition of  approximately  $306 million to utility  plant.  The
funds for these additions and other capital  requirements were derived primarily
from  operations  and  increased   short-term  debt.  See  SOUTHERN's  Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first three months of 1996, the operating  companies sold $40 million
of first  mortgage  bonds,  and  through  public  authorities,  $21  million  of
pollution  control  revenue bonds.  Retirements,  including  maturities,  of the
operating  companies'  first mortgage bonds and pollution  control revenue bonds
totaled $244  million.  A subsidiary of ALABAMA  formed as a statutory  business
trust sold $97 million of trust preferred  securities  guaranteed by ALABAMA and
loaned the proceeds of such securities to ALABAMA. See Note (H) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for further details.

     During the first  quarter of 1996,  SOUTHERN  raised $19  million  from the
issuance of new common stock under  SOUTHERN's  various stock plans.  The market
price of SOUTHERN's common stock at March 31, 1996 was $23.875 per share and the
book  value was $13.09 per share,  representing  a  market-to-book  ratio of 182
percent, compared to $24.625, $13.10 and 188 percent,  respectively,  at the end
of 1995. The dividend for the first quarter of 1996 was 31.5 cents per share.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of SOUTHERN
under  "Capital  Requirements  for  Construction,"  "Environmental  Matters" and
"Other Capital  Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern
electric   system's  capital   requirements   for  its   construction   program,
environmental  compliance efforts,  sinking fund requirements and maturing debt.
Approximately  $100  million  will be  required by March 31,  1997,  for present
sinking fund  requirements and maturities of long-term debt. Also, the operating
subsidiaries  plan to  continue,  to the  extent  possible,  a program to retire
higher-cost  debt  and  preferred  stock  and  replace  these  obligations  with
lower-cost capital.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Sources of Capital

In addition to the  financing  activities  previously  described,  SOUTHERN  may
require  additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of  additional  equity  capital  to be raised in 1996,  as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources  similar to those used in the past.  The amount,  type and
timing of any  financings--if  needed--will  depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings,  regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors.
Currently,  each of the operating  companies  expects to have adequate  earnings
coverage  ratios for any  anticipated  security sales through at least 1998. See
Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing  Programs"  in the Form  10-K  for  additional
information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
March 31,  1996,  approximately  $312 million of cash and cash  equivalents  and
approximately  $2.7 billion of unused credit  arrangements  with banks. At March
31, 1996, the system  companies had  outstanding  approximately  $1.4 billion of
short-term notes payable and $932 million of commercial paper.  Since SOUTHERN's
construction  program  with  respect to major  generating  projects  in the core
business  has been  completed,  management  believes  that the need for  working
capital can be adequately met by utilizing  lines of credit without  maintaining
large cash balances.

     See Note (D) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for discussion of
financial derivative contracts entered into by SOUTHERN.

                              ALABAMA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1996 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1995


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter of
1996 was $73.2 million,  compared to $65.3 million for the same quarter of 1995.
This 12.0%  increase  in earnings  is  principally  the result of an increase in
operating revenues offset somewhat by an increase in operating expenses.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the
following:

                                                        Increase (Decrease)
                                                --------------------------------
                                                (in thousands)              %
Revenues........................................    $36,431                 5.9
Revenues from affiliates........................     49,607               178.4
Fuel expense....................................     54,359                34.6
Interest income.................................      4,775                97.5
Interest on long-term debt......................     (2,824)               (6.2)
Amortization of debt discount, premium and
  expense, net..................................      4,853               192.6
Other interest charges..........................      6,743               140.7


     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses  and do not  affect  income,  revenues  for the first  quarter  of 1996
increased  $21.7  million,  compared to the  corresponding  period of 1995.  The
increase in revenues was influenced most heavily by an increase in the amount of
retail  energy  sold.  For  the  first  three  months  of  1996,   total  retail
kilowatt-hour  sales  increased  8.6% over the same  period of 1995,  and retail
revenues,  excluding  fuel  revenues,  increased  $26.0  million.   Residential,
commercial  and  industrial  energy  sales  increased  13.9%,  13.8%  and  2.8%,
respectively.  Weather and a strong economy in ALABAMA's service territory had a
positive effect on retail sales.

     Revenues  from  affiliates.  Revenues  from sales to  affiliated  companies
within the Southern electric system,  as well as purchases of energy,  will vary
from  period  to period  depending  on  demand,  the  availability,  and cost of
generating  resources  at  each  company.  These  transactions  did  not  have a
significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. The increase in fuel expense for the first quarter of 1996 as
compared  to the same  quarter of 1995 can be  attributed  to higher  generation
necessary to meet the increased demand for electricity.

     Interest  income and Other  interest  charges.  Interest  income  increased
approximately  $5  million as the  result of the  recognition  of gains from the
sales of securities  from the nuclear  decommissioning  trust.  This increase in
income was  offset by a  concurrent  recognition  of other  interest  charges in
accordance with FERC requirements.

     Interest on  long-term  debt.  The decline in  interest on  long-term  debt
reflects the redemption  and  refinancing of long-term debt over the past twelve
months.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Amortization of debt discount,  premium and expense,  net. This increase is
the result of ALABAMA's  reducing the asset  account,  as allowed by the Alabama
PSC,  relating  to premiums  incurred  in  connection  with the  refinancing  of
high-cost debt. See Note (G) to the Condensed  Financial  Statements  herein for
further details.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is  positioning  the business to meet the challenge of  increasing  competition.
Legislation  has been  enacted in Alabama  that would  establish  a process  for
determining  whether  utilities  would  experience  "stranded  costs"  upon  the
transfer of an existing customer of a utility to another electric supplier. This
legislation  authorizes  the  Alabama  PSC to make a  determination  of  whether
stranded  costs  would  exist as a result of such a transfer  by a  customer  of
ALABAMA and would require the customer  seeking an  alternative  supplier to pay
any stranded costs found to exist.  The legislation  has termination  provisions
keyed  to  passage  of  comprehensive   retail  electric   service   competition
legislation which addresses  stranded costs of existing utilities and eliminates
the  obligation of utilities to provide  generating  resources.  For  additional
information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  "Competition"  and  Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS - "Future  Earnings  Potential"  of ALABAMA in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset.  For additional  information about the Clean Air Act and
other important  environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     Reference  is made to Notes  (B),  (C),  (F) and (G) in the  "Notes  to the
Condensed Financial  Statements" herein for discussion of various  contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.  Reference is also
made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in ALABAMA's  financial condition during the first three months
of 1996 was the addition of  approximately  $105.7 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital  requirements were derived primarily
from  operating  activities  and an increase in short-term  debt.  See ALABAMA's
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

In January  1996,  Alabama Power  Capital  Trust I, a statutory  business  trust
established for the sole purpose of holding ALABAMA's junior  subordinated notes
and issuing preferred securities, sold $97,000,000 of its 7.375% trust preferred
securities  which  are  guaranteed  by  ALABAMA.  See Note (H) to the  Condensed
Financial  Statements  herein for  further  details.  Also in  January,  ALABAMA
redeemed $23.8 million of its 9 1/4% first mortgage bonds due 2021.  ALABAMA's
4 1/2% first  mortgage bonds in the principal amount of $60.0 million matured on
March 1, 1996.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     ALABAMA will continue to retire  higher-cost  debt and preferred  stock and
replace these obligations with lower-cost capital, as market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS of ALABAMA
under "Capital  Requirements,"  "Other Capital  Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description  of ALABAMA's  capital  requirements
for  its  construction  program,  maturing  debt  and  environmental  compliance
efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing  activities  previously  described herein,  ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds  required for  construction  and other  purposes  from
sources  similar to those used in the past.  The amount,  type and timing of any
financings--if  needed--will  depend  upon  maintenance  of  adequate  earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
ALABAMA  expects to have adequate  earnings  coverage ratios for any anticipated
security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and  contingencies,  ALABAMA had at March 31,
1996,  approximately $4.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and had committed
lines of credit of approximately  $488 million with regulatory  authority for up
to $750  million  of  short-term  borrowing.  At March  31,  1996,  ALABAMA  had
outstanding  $10.0  million  of  short-term  notes  payable  to banks and $426.0
million of commercial  paper.  As of May 3, 1996, the committed  lines of credit
had been  increased to  approximately  $608 million.  Since ALABAMA has no major
generating  plants under  construction,  management  believes  that the need for
working  capital can be  adequately  met by  utilizing  lines of credit  without
maintaining large cash balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying  condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of March 31, 1996, and the related condensed statements of income for
the three-month periods ended March 31, 1996 and 1995, and condensed  statements
of cash flows for the three-month  periods ended March 31, 1996 and 1995.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance  with  standards  established  by the
American  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants.  A  review  of  interim
financial  information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial  data and making  inquiries of persons  responsible  for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the  expression  of an opinion  regarding the  financial  statements  taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review,  we are not aware of any material  modifications  that
should be made to the financial  statements  referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously  audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards,  the balance  sheet of ALABAMA  POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1995
(not presented  herein) and, in our report dated February 21, 1996, we expressed
an unqualified  opinion on that statement.  In our opinion,  the information set
forth in the  accompanying  condensed  balance  sheet as of December 31, 1995 is
fairly stated, in all material  respects,  in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1996 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1995


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter of
1996 was $114.4  million,  compared to $116.1  million  for the same  quarter of
1995.  The  increase in  operating  expenses  outpaced the increase in operating
revenues for the quarter, resulting in a 1.5% decline in earnings.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the
following:

                                                      Increase (Decrease)
                                              ----------------------------------
                                              (in thousands)              %
Revenues......................................   $ 54,306                 5.7
Fuel expense..................................    (12,449)               (6.2)
Purchased power from affiliates...............     35,746               120.2
Provision for separation benefits.............     17,440              1645.3
Maintenance expense...........................      9,857                14.9
Depreciation and amortization expense.........     11,360                11.8
Interest on long-term debt....................    (15,135)              (22.1)


     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses  and do not  affect  income,  revenues  for the first  quarter  of 1996
increased  $26.2  million,  compared to the  corresponding  period of 1995.  The
increase in revenues was influenced most heavily by an increase in the amount of
retail  energy  sold.  For  the  first  three  months  of  1996,   total  retail
kilowatt-hour  sales  increased  7.0% over the same  period of 1995,  and retail
revenues, excluding fuel revenues, increased 5.0% or $33.8 million. Residential,
commercial  and  industrial   energy  sales  increased  11.0%,  8.8%  and  3.2%,
respectively.  Colder-than-normal  temperatures  and a  slight  increase  in the
number of customers  served had a positive effect on retail sales.  Energy sales
to  non-affiliated  wholesale  customers for the first quarter of 1996 increased
16.0%  compared to the  corresponding  period of 1995 primarily due to increased
demand by municipalities and cooperatives in Georgia. However, capacity revenues
from sales to non-affiliated  utilities outside the service territory fell $10.3
million  primarily due to the scheduled  decline in megawatts of capacity  under
long-term contracts.

     Fuel  expense.  Fuel  expense  decreased  primarily  due to a  decrease  in
generation by GEORGIA  resulting from the timing of maintenance at fossil plants
and a slightly lower average cost of fuel.  (See Purchased power from affiliates
below.)

     Purchased power from  affiliates.  As a result of the timing of maintenance
at fossil plants  discussed  above,  purchased power from  affiliates  increased
compared  to the same period of 1995.  Purchased  power  transactions  among the
affiliated  companies within the Southern  electric system will vary from period
to  period  depending  on demand  and the  availability  and cost of  generating
resources at each company.  These  transactions do not have a significant impact
on earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Provision for separation benefits. The increase in provision for separation
benefits for the first  quarter of 1996 compared to the first quarter of 1995 is
attributable to work force reduction  programs,  which have been  implemented to
control growth in future operating expenses.

     Maintenance expense. The increase in maintenance expense is attributable to
the timing of maintenance performed primarily on fossil plants.

     Depreciation  and  amortization  expense.   Depreciation  and  amortization
increased in the first quarter of 1996 primarily due to accelerated depreciation
of generating  plants  pursuant to a new retail rate plan  effective  January 1,
1996, an increase in plant-in-service and an increase in nuclear decommissioning
expense.

     Interest on  long-term  debt.  The decline in  interest on  long-term  debt
reflects the redemption  and  refinancing of long-term debt over the past twelve
months.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional  information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Competition"  and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in
the Form 10-K.

     Effective  January 1, 1996,  GEORGIA  began  operating  under a  three-year
retail rate plan. Under the plan, GEORGIA's earnings will be evaluated against a
retail  return on common  equity  range of 10% to 12.5%.  GEORGIA is required to
absorb cost increases of approximately  $29.0 million annually during the plan's
three-year   operation,   including   $14.0  million   annually  of  accelerated
depreciation of electric  plant.  Reference is made to Note (I) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for additional information.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset.  For additional  information about the Clean Air Act and
other important  environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (B),  (C), (F) and (I) through (N) in the "Notes
to  the  Condensed  Financial  Statements"  herein  for  discussion  of  various
contingencies  and other  matters which may affect  future  earnings  potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's  financial condition during the first three months
of 1996 was the addition of  approximately  $112.0 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital  requirements were derived primarily
from operations.  See GEORGIA's  Condensed  Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Financing Activities

In January  1996,  GEORGIA  sold $10.0  million of 6.07%  first  mortgage  bonds
secured  medium-term  notes due 2005. In February 1996, $6.8 million of proceeds
from such sale were applied to the  redemption  of three  outstanding  series of
industrial development bonds at rates ranging from 6 3/8% to 6 3/4%. GEORGIA's
4 3/4% first mortgage bonds in the principal  amount of $150.0 million  matured
on March 1, 1996.

     GEORGIA  plans to  continue,  to the extent  possible,  a program to retire
higher-cost  debt  and  preferred  stock  and  replace  these  obligations  with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital  Requirements"  and  "Environmental  Issues" in the
Form  10-K  for  a  description  of  GEORGIA's  capital   requirements  for  its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing  activities  previously  described herein,  GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds  required for  construction  and other  purposes  from
sources  similar to those used in the past.  The amount,  type and timing of any
financings--if  needed--will  depend  upon  maintenance  of  adequate  earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
GEORGIA  expects to have adequate  earnings  coverage ratios for any anticipated
security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and  contingencies,  GEORGIA had at March 31,
1996, approximately $14.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$740.0  million of unused  credit  arrangements  with banks.  At March 31, 1996,
GEORGIA had outstanding  $254.8 million of short-term notes payable to banks and
$218.3 million of commercial paper. Since GEORGIA has no major generating plants
under construction, management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately  met by  utilizing  lines of credit  without  maintaining  large cash
balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying  condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia  corporation) as of March 31, 1996, and the related condensed
statements of income for the three-month  periods ended March 31, 1996 and 1995,
and the  condensed  statements of cash flows for the  three-month  periods ended
March 31, 1996 and 1995. These financial  statements are the  responsibility  of
the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance  with  standards  established  by the
American  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants.  A  review  of  interim
financial  information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial  data and making  inquiries of persons  responsible  for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the  expression  of an opinion  regarding the  financial  statements  taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review,  we are not aware of any material  modifications  that
should be made to the financial  statements  referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously  audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards,  the balance  sheet of GEORGIA  POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1995
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 21, 1996, we expressed
an unqualified  opinion on that statement.  In our opinion,  the information set
forth in the  accompanying  condensed  balance sheet as of December 31, 1995, is
fairly stated, in all material  respects,  in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                               GULF POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1996 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1995


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after  dividends on preferred  stock for the first  quarter of
1996 was $11.3 million,  compared to $10.9 million for the same quarter of 1995.
This 3.5%  increase  in  earnings  is  principally  the result of an increase in
retail revenues offset somewhat by an increase in operating expenses.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the
following:

                                                Increase (Decrease)
                                        -------------------------------------
                                        (in thousands)              %
Revenues................................    $17,894                13.2
Fuel expense............................     (5,741)              (13.1)
Purchased power from affiliates.........     13,277               219.7
Other operation expense.................     (2,646)               (9.4)
Maintenance expense.....................      5,415                56.2


     Revenues.  Of the $17.9 million  increase in revenues,  approximately  $6.8
million impacted earnings.  Territorial revenues, excluding those revenues which
represent the pass-through of fuel expense and certain other expenses and do not
affect  income,  increased  $6.4  million.  The increase in retail  revenues was
influenced  significantly  by an 11.3%  increase in total  retail  kilowatt-hour
sales  over the same  period  of 1995.  The  change in  retail  energy  sales is
primarily  due to  higher  residential  and  commercial  sales  as a  result  of
colder-than-normal  winter  weather  and a  slight  increase  in the  number  of
customers  served.  Industrial sales were also up 3.9% compared to one year ago;
however,  industrial  revenues  were  down  slightly  mainly  due  to  increased
participation  in the  Real-Time-Pricing  program.  The increase in revenues can
also be attributed  to higher  capacity  revenues  from sales to  non-affiliated
utilities outside the service territory of $379,000.

     Fuel expense.  The reduction in fuel expense is primarily  attributable  to
decreased  generation by GULF due to the scheduled  maintenance outages at Plant
Crist and Plant Daniel during the first quarter of 1996.  (See  Purchased  power
from  affiliates  below.)  The  average  cost of fuel  was  unchanged  from  the
corresponding period in 1995.

     Purchased power from  affiliates.  As a result of the  maintenance  outages
discussed above,  purchased power from affiliates increased compared to the same
period of 1995.  Purchased  power  transactions  among the affiliated  companies
within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on
demand and the  availability  and cost of generating  resources at each company.
These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operation expense. Other operation expense decreased primarily due to
a reduction in amortization  costs related to the buyout of long-term  contracts
for the  supply  of  coal  to  Plant  Daniel  and  also a  decrease  in  various
administrative and general expenses.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Maintenance expense. The increase in maintenance expense is attributable to
the  scheduled  maintenance  of  production  facilities at Plant Crist and Plant
Daniel during the first quarter of 1996.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition.  In
September  1995,  GULF filed with the Florida PSC a petition for approval of its
proposed  Commercial/Industrial  Service Rider, which would be applicable to the
rate schedules  serving GULF's  largest and most at-risk  customers.  During the
first quarter of 1996, testimony was filed,  interrogatories were answered,  and
hearings were held.  GULF filed its  post-hearing  brief with the Florida PSC on
April 8, 1996.  A decision  by the  Florida  PSC is  expected  by late May.  For
additional  information,  see Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the
Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's environmental cost recovery clause.
For  additional  information  about  the  Clean  Air  Act  and  other  important
environmental  issues,  see Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  -
"Environmental Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     Reference  is made to  Notes  (B) and (F) in the  "Notes  to the  Condensed
Financial  Statements" herein for discussion of various  contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GULF's financial  condition during the first three months of
1996 was the addition of approximately $16.7 million to utility plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital  requirements  were derived primarily from
operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

In January  1996,  GULF sold $30.0  million of 6.875% first  mortgage  bonds due
2026. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of GULF's outstanding short-term
debt.  GULF's  first  mortgage  bond  indenture  contains  various  common stock
dividend  restrictions  which  remain  in  effect  as  long  as  the  bonds  are
outstanding.  Under  the  terms of  GULF's  supplemental  indenture  dated as of
January 1, 1996,  retained earnings of $127 million were restricted  against the
payment of cash dividends on common stock at March 31, 1996.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In February 1996,  GULF sold through a public  authority,  $21.2 million of
5.5%  pollution  control  revenue  refunding  bonds due 2026.  The proceeds were
applied  to the  redemption  on  April  1,  1996 of  $21.2  million  outstanding
principal  amount  of 7.125%  pollution  control  revenue  refunding  bonds.  In
February  1996,  GULF issued a $22.1  million  5.2125%  bank note due 1998.  The
proceeds  were used to buy out a portion  of an  existing  coal  contract.  Bond
retirements  during  the first  quarter  of 1996  totaled  $1.8  million to meet
improvement fund requirements.

     In April 1996,  GULF sold through a public  authority,  $12.075  million of
5.25% pollution  control revenue  refunding bonds due 2006. The proceeds will be
applied to the redemption in May 1996 of $12.075 million  outstanding  principal
amount of 6% pollution  control  revenue bonds.  GULF plans to continue,  to the
extent  possible,  a program to retire  higher-cost debt and preferred stock and
replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital  Requirements  for  Construction,"  "Environmental  Matters" and "Other
Capital  Requirements"  in the Form 10-K for a  description  of  GULF's  capital
requirements for its construction program,  environmental compliance efforts and
maturing debt.  Approximately  $40.6 million will be required by March 31, 1997,
for maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities  previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds  required for  construction  and other purposes from sources
similar  to  those  used  in the  past.  The  amount,  type  and  timing  of any
financings--if  needed--will  depend  upon  maintenance  of  adequate  earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
GULF  expects to have  adequate  earnings  coverage  ratios for any  anticipated
security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet  short-term  cash  needs and  contingencies,  GULF had at March 31,
1996,  approximately $0.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $36.0 million
of unused  committed  lines of credit with banks.  At March 31,  1996,  GULF had
outstanding  $35.5 million of short-term notes payable to banks.  Since GULF has
no major generating plants under construction, management believes that the need
for working  capital can be adequately met by utilizing  lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

                            MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1996 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1995


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's  net  income  after  dividends  on  preferred  stock for the first
quarter of 1996 was $11.7 million, compared to $9.3 million for the same quarter
of 1995.  This  26.2%  increase  in  earnings  is  principally  the result of an
increase in revenues offset somewhat by an increase in operating expenses.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the
following:

                                                     Increase (Decrease)
                                             -----------------------------------
                                             (in thousands)              %
Revenues.....................................    $17,761                16.6
Fuel expense.................................      5,110                20.6
Purchased power from affiliates..............      3,451                36.1
Maintenance expense..........................      1,769                20.7
Depreciation and amortization expense........      1,455                14.7
Taxes other than income taxes................      1,345                14.3


     Revenues.  The  increase  in revenues  was  influenced  most  heavily by an
increase in the amount of retail  energy  sold.  For the first  three  months of
1996,  total retail  kilowatt-hour  sales increased 9.5% over the same period of
1995. Retail revenues,  excluding those revenues which represent the recovery of
fuel expense and certain other expenses and do not affect income, increased $4.6
million.  Colder-than-normal  winter weather and a slight increase in the number
of  customers  served  had a  positive  effect  on  retail  sales.  Residential,
commercial  and  industrial  energy  sales  increased  16.2%,  12.1%  and  5.0%,
respectively.  Colder temperatures also positively impacted sales to territorial
wholesale customers.  Revenues from territorial  wholesale customers,  excluding
fuel revenues which do not affect income, increased $4.2 million compared to the
same period of 1995, with an increase in energy sales of 20%.

     Fuel expense. The increase in fuel expense for the first quarter of 1996 as
compared  to the same  quarter of 1995 can be  attributed  to higher  generation
necessary to meet the increased  demand for  electricity  and a slightly  higher
average cost of fuel.

     Purchased power from  affiliates.  Purchased power  transactions  among the
affiliated  companies within the Southern  electric system will vary from period
to  period  depending  on demand  and the  availability  and cost of  generating
resources at each company.  These  transactions do not have a significant impact
on earnings.

     Maintenance  expense.  The  increase in  maintenance  expense is  primarily
attributable  to maintenance  performed at Plant Daniel during the first quarter
of 1996. In 1995,  maintenance  normally  performed during the first quarter was
postponed until later in the year.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Depreciation and amortization  expense. Due to additional plant investment,
depreciation expense for the first quarter of 1996 increased  approximately $0.5
million  compared  to the  first  quarter  of 1995.  Increased  amortization  of
regulatory assets, primarily those assets related to the ECO plan, accounted for
the remaining $1.0 million increase in this item.

     Taxes other than income taxes. Taxes other than income taxes rose above the
amount  recorded  for the first  quarter of 1995 due to higher  retail  revenues
which resulted in higher municipal franchise taxes.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.  Operating  revenues will be affected by any changes in rates under
the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing  force on electric
rates,  with only  moderate  changes in rates taking place.  MISSISSIPPI's  1996
annual  filing  under  the ECO plan  with the  Mississippi  PSC  resulted  in an
approved annual revenue  requirement  decrease of $3.0 million,  effective April
1996.

     MISSISSIPPI  has entered into  agreements to purchase  summer peaking power
and  options  for  power for the  years  1996  through  2000.  For June  through
September  of  1996,  MISSISSIPPI  has  entered  into  an  agreement  to buy 242
megawatts of capacity and energy from another electric utility. For June through
September of 1997 through 2000,  MISSISSIPPI  has purchased from power marketers
options for up to 250 megawatts of peaking power in 1997; 300 megawatts in 1998;
350 megawatts in 1999;  and 400  megawatts in 2000.  In April 1996,  MISSISSIPPI
filed a petition with the Mississippi PSC requesting that MISSISSIPPI be allowed
to  earn a  return  on the  capacity  portion  of such  agreements.  MISSISSIPPI
anticipates a decision from the PSC within 120 days.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional  information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Competition"  and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S   DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  -  "Future   Earnings   Potential"  of
MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered.  For additional  information  about the Clean Air Act
and other important  environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     Reference  is made to  Notes  (B) and (F) in the  "Notes  to the  Condensed
Financial  Statements" herein for discussion of various  contingencies and other
matters which may affect future  earnings  potential.  Reference is also made to
Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in  MISSISSIPPI's  financial  condition  during the first three
months of 1996 was the addition of approximately $12.2 million to utility plant.
The funds for  these  additions  and other  capital  requirements  were  derived
primarily from operations and an increase in short-term debt. See  MISSISSIPPI's
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Financing Activities

During the first three months of 1996,  maturities  of long-term  notes to banks
totaled $20.0 million,  while  short-term  indebtedness to banks increased $31.0
million.

     MISSISSIPPI plans to continue,  to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost  debt  and  preferred  stock  and  replace  these  obligations  with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference  is  made  to  Item  7  -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  of
MISSISSIPPI  under  "Capital  Requirements  for  Construction,"   "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital  Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of
MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its construction  program,  environmental
compliance efforts,  sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt.
Approximately  $37.2  million  will be required by March 31,  1997,  for present
sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds  required for  construction  and other  purposes  from
sources  similar to those used in the past.  The amount,  type and timing of any
financings--if  needed--will  depend  upon  maintenance  of  adequate  earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
MISSISSIPPI   expects  to  have  adequate   earnings  coverage  ratios  for  any
anticipated  security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS -
"Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and  contingencies,  MISSISSIPPI had at March
31,  1996,   approximately  $2.2  million  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and
approximately  $97.0 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks.
At March 31, 1996, MISSISSIPPI had outstanding $31.0 million of short-term notes
payable  to  banks.  Since  MISSISSIPPI  has no major  generating  plants  under
construction,  management  believes  that the need for  working  capital  can be
adequately  met by  utilizing  lines of credit  without  maintaining  large cash
balances.

                       SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1996 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1995


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income after  dividends on preferred  stock for the first quarter
of 1996 was $2.7 million, compared to $2.4 million for the same quarter of 1995.
This 13.2%  increase  in earnings  is  principally  the result of an increase in
retail  revenues  and a decrease  in  interest  expense  offset  somewhat  by an
increase in operating expenses.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the
following:

                                                 Increase (Decrease)
                                         -------------------------------------
                                         (in thousands)              %
Revenues................................      $4,351                 9.7
Fuel expense............................       2,599               192.5
Interest on long-term debt..............        (215)               (6.9)


     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses  and do not  affect  income,  revenues  for the first  quarter  of 1996
increased approximately $466,000,  compared to the corresponding period of 1995.
The  increase  in revenues  was  influenced  most  heavily by an increase in the
amount of retail energy sold.  For the first three months of 1996,  total retail
kilowatt-hour  sales  increased  6.1% over the same  period of 1995,  and retail
revenues,   excluding   fuel   revenues,   increased   approximately   $767,000.
Colder-than-normal  winter  weather  and a  slight  increase  in the  number  of
customers served accounted for most of the 13.8% increase in residential  demand
and 11% increase commercial demand. Kilowatt-hour sales to the industrial sector
were down  8.8% and  industrial  revenues  were down  6.2%,  primarily  due to a
reduction in the production schedule,  and hence energy requirements,  of one of
SAVANNAH's major industrial  customers and the implementation of new time-of-use
rates for industrial customers in the first quarter of 1996.

     Fuel expense. The increase in fuel expense for the first quarter of 1996 as
compared  to the same  quarter of 1995 can be  attributed  to higher  generation
necessary to meet the increased  demand for  electricity,  partially offset by a
lower average cost of fuel.

     Interest on long-term  debt.  Interest on long-term  debt  decreased in the
first  quarter of 1996 as  compared to the same  period of 1995  primarily  as a
result of the replacement by SAVANNAH, during the second quarter of 1995, of its
9 1/4% first  mortgage  bonds with 7 7/8% first mortgage bonds and variable rate
bank notes.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.

                       SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional  information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Competition"  and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings  Potential" of SAVANNAH
in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset.  For additional  information about the Clean Air Act and
other important  environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (O) and (P) in the "Notes to the  Condensed
Financial  Statements" herein for discussion of various  contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first three months
of 1996 was the addition of  approximately  $6.7 million to utility  plant.  The
funds for these additions and other capital  requirements were derived primarily
from internal sources and bank debt. See SAVANNAH's Condensed Statements of Cash
Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first three months of 1996,  SAVANNAH  issued no new  securities  and
retired  $1.2  million of its 9 3/8% first  mortgage  bonds to meet sinking fund
requirements.  SAVANNAH  entered into  arrangements  with the Savannah  Economic
Development  Authority  to  provide  for the  financing  of a new coal  handling
facility at Plant Kraft. The related  capitalized lease amount at March 31, 1996
was $7.0 million.

     SAVANNAH  plans to continue,  to the extent  possible,  a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of SAVANNAH
under  "Capital  Requirements  for  Construction,"  "Environmental  Matters" and
"Other  Capital  Requirements"  in the Form 10-K for a description of SAVANNAH's
capital  requirements for its  construction  program,  environmental  compliance
efforts, sinking fund requirements and long-term debt maturities.  Approximately
$0.6  million will be required by March 31, 1997,  for  maturities  of long-term
debt.

Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for  construction and other purposes
from sources  similar to those used in the past. The amount,  type and timing of
any  financings--if  needed--will  depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
SAVANNAH expects to have adequate  earnings  coverage ratios for any anticipated
security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies,  SAVANNAH had at March 31,
1996,  approximately $0.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$37.0  million of unused  credit  arrangements  with banks.  At March 31,  1996,
SAVANNAH had  outstanding  $3.5 million of  short-term  notes  payable to banks.
Since SAVANNAH has no major  generating  plants under  construction,  management
believes that the need for working  capital can be  adequately  met by utilizing
lines of credit.

        The  condensed  financial  statements  of ALABAMA and GEORGIA  included
     herein have been reviewed by ALABAMA's and  GEORGIA's  independent  public
     accountants as set forth in their reports  included herein as Exhibit 1 to
     ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)  SOUTHERN's  operating  affiliates  are subject to the  provisions  of FASB
     Statement  No.  71,  Accounting  for  the  Effects  of  Certain  Types  of
     Regulation.  In the event that a portion of a company's  operations  is no
     longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
     off related regulatory assets and liabilities,  and determine if any other
     assets have been impaired. For additional  information,  see Note 1 to the
     financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(C)  The staff of the SEC has  questioned  certain  of the  current  accounting
     practices     of     the     electric     utility      industry--including
     SOUTHERN's--regarding  the recognition,  measurement and classification of
     decommissioning  costs for nuclear generating  facilities in the financial
     statements. In response to these questions, the FASB has decided to review
     the  accounting  for  liabilities   related  to  closure  and  removal  of
     long-lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning. Reference is made to
     MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS - "Future  Earnings  Potential"  of
     SOUTHERN,  ALABAMA  and  GEORGIA  in  Item 7 and  Note 1 to the  financial
     statements  of  SOUTHERN,  ALABAMA and  GEORGIA  under  "Depreciation  and
     Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)  The SOUTHERN system utilizes certain financial derivative contracts solely
     for the  purpose  of risk  management.  The  companies'  participation  in
     derivative  contracts  has been to hedge  non-core  business  exposure  to
     fluctuations  in interest rates and foreign  currency  exchange  rates. At
     March 31, 1996,  the status of  outstanding  derivative  contracts  was as
     follows:

                                    Maturity or         Notional    Unrealized
                  Type              Termination          Amount     Gain (Loss)
                  ----              -----------         --------    -----------
                                                             (in thousands)
      Interest rate swaps           1999-2006           $423,503       $4,233
      Foreign currency forwards     Renewed monthly      386,724          464

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(E)   Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN in
      Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a description of the proceedings  related to a
      derivative  action filed against certain current and former  directors and
      officers of SOUTHERN.

(F)   Reference  is  made  to  Note  3  to  each  of  the  registrant's,  except
      SAVANNAH's,  financial  statements  in  Item  8 of  the  Form  10-K  for a
      discussion  of  the  proceedings  initiated  by  the  FERC  regarding  the
      reasonableness  of the return on common  equity on certain of the Southern
      electric system's wholesale rate schedules and contracts.

(G)   In June 1995,  the  Alabama  PSC issued a rate  order  granting  ALABAMA's
      request  for gradual  adjustments  to move toward  parity  among  customer
      classes.  This order also calls for a moratorium  on any  periodic  retail
      rate increases (but not decreases) until July 2001.  In December 1995, the
      Alabama PSC issued an order  authorizing  ALABAMA to reduce  balance sheet
      items--such as plant and deferred  charges--at  any time ALABAMA's  actual
      base rate revenues exceed the budgeted revenues. Reference is made to Note
      3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN  and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the
      Form 10-K for additional information.

(H)   In January 1996,  Alabama Power  Capital Trust I (the  "Trust"),  of which
      ALABAMA  owns all the  common  securities,  issued  $97  million of 7.375%
      mandatory redeemable preferred securities. Substantially all of the assets
      of the Trust are $100  million  aggregate  principal  amount of  ALABAMA's
      7.375% Junior  Subordinated  Notes due March 31, 2026.  ALABAMA  considers
      that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the preferred  securities,
      taken together,  constitute a full and unconditional  guarantee by ALABAMA
      of  the  Trust's  payment   obligations  with  respect  to  the  preferred
      securities.

(I)   On February  16, 1996,  the Georgia PSC approved a three-year  retail rate
      plan for GEORGIA  effective  January 1, 1996. For additional  information,
      reference is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(J)   Pursuant to orders from the Georgia PSC, GEORGIA  deferred  financing  and
      depreciation  costs under  phase-in plans for Plant  Vogtle  Units 1 and 2
      until the allowed  investment was fully  reflected  in rates as of October
      1991. In addition, the Georgia PSC issued two separate  accounting  orders
      that required  GEORGIA to defer substantially  all operating and financing
      costs related to both units until rate orders addressed  these costs.  The
      Georgia PSC orders provide for recovery of deferred costs within 10 years.
      The Georgia PSC also ordered GEORGIA to levelize declining capacity 
      buyback expense from the co-owners of the plant over a six-year period
      beginning October 1991. The unamortized  balance of these deferred costs
      at March 31, 1996, was $273.9 million. See Note 3 to the financial
      statements of GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional
      information.

(K)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information concerning the recovery
      by GEORGIA of its costs  associated with the Rocky Mountain pumped storage
      hydroelectric plant.

(L)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information  regarding  recovery by
      GEORGIA  of  its  costs  associated  with  its  discontinued   demand-side
      conservation programs.

(M)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item
      8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding joint complaints filed by OPC
      and MEAG seeking  recovery from GEORGIA for alleged  partial  requirements
      rates overcharges plus interest.

      designation  as a potentially  responsible  party under the  Comprehensive
      Environmental   Response,   Compensation   and  Liability  Act  and  other
      environmental contingencies.

(O)   Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SAVANNAH in
