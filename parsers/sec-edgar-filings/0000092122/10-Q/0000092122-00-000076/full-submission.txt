                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   FIRST QUARTER 2000 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1999

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SOUTHERN's traditional business is primarily represented
by its five integrated Southeast utilities, which provide electric service in
four states. Another significant portion of SOUTHERN's business is represented
by Southern Energy, which owns and manages domestic and international businesses
for SOUTHERN. Businesses acquired by Southern Energy have been included in the
consolidated statements of income since the date of acquisition. Certain changes
in operating revenues and expenses from the prior period result from such
acquisitions. Reference is made to Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for information relating to the planned initial
public offering and subsequent spin-off of Southern Energy.

Earnings

SOUTHERN's  consolidated  net income for the first quarter of 2000 was $245
million  ($0.38 per share)  compared to $224  million  ($0.32 per share) for the
corresponding  period of 1999.  Earnings for the integrated  Southeast utilities
increased  during the first  quarter of 2000 when compared to the same period in
1999 by $8  million  or 3.8% due  primarily  to  increased  operating  revenues.
Earnings  for Southern  Energy in the first  quarter of 2000 rose $13 million or
14.9%  above the  amount  recorded  in the same  period of the prior  year.  The
increase   in  Southern   Energy's   earnings  is  mainly  due  to  the  growing
profitability from its Asian business units primarily due to the Sual generating
units being placed in service during the latter part of 1999.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                     Increase (Decrease)
                                                 -----------------------------
                                                          First Quarter

                                                 (in thousands)        %
Operating revenues...............................  $131,022            5.4
Fuel expense.....................................   136,283           26.6
Purchased power expense..........................  (170,005)         (61.9)
Maintenance expense..............................    19,892            9.0
Depreciation and amortization expense............    62,211           19.7
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries   (73,524)         (77.7)
Other, net.......................................    19,947           74.7
Interest on long-term debt.......................    33,996           20.4
Interest on notes payable........................    39,647          144.4

     Operating revenues. For the integrated Southeast utilities, operating
revenues increased $123 million or 6.6% during the first quarter of 2000 over
the corresponding period in 1999 due primarily to a $108 million increase in
retail revenues. Retail revenues increased as a result of growth in the number
of customers and increased demand for energy. Energy sales to residential,
commercial and industrial customers were up by 3.9%, 7.5% and 2.9%,
respectively.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel expense. These expenses for the integrated Southeast utilities were up
$53 million or 11.3% when compared to the corresponding period in 1999, due
primarily to higher demand for energy. Southern Energy's fuel expense in the
first quarter of 2000 was up $84 million or 200.5% from the same period in 1999.
This increase is primarily due to the acquisitions in 1999 of generating assets
in New York and California.

     Purchased power expense. The first quarter 2000 decrease is attributed
primarily to Southern Energy which had a decrease of $198 million or 86.8% due
to the sale of SWEB's supply business and was partially offset by a $27 million
increase in purchased power expense at the integrated Southeast utilities.

     Maintenance expense. Maintenance expenses were up $13 million or 6.3% for
the integrated Southeast utilities during the first quarter of 2000 as compared
to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to
maintenance performed on steam and nuclear power generation facilities and
distribution lines. Southern Energy's first quarter 2000 maintenance expenses
were up $8 million or 28.9% from the corresponding period in 1999. The increase
was primarily due to the acquisitions in 1999 of generating assets in New York
and California.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. This expense for the integrated
Southeast utilities increased $29 million in the first quarter of 2000 as
compared to the corresponding period in 1999, principally due to accelerated
amortization of $36.6 million recorded by GEORGIA under a three-year rate order.
See Note (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for
further details regarding the retail rate order. Depreciation and amortization
expense for Southern Energy during the first quarter of 2000 increased $32
million or 58.7% primarily due to the increase in assets in Asia and North
America.

     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. During the first quarter
of 2000, the decrease in this item when compared to the same period in 1999 is
attributed to Southern Energy. The decrease is a direct result of the $54
million settlement recognized during the first quarter of 1999 representing
Southern Energy's claims against a contractor relating to the Shajiao C
construction project in China and the improvement in profitability of the
Shajiao C operation which was partially offset by other related expenses and
income taxes included in other income accounts,and a decrease in the sales price
of electricity at BEWAG due to the onset of deregulation and price competition
in Germany.

     Other, net. The first quarter of 2000 increased when compared to the
corresponding period in 1999 due primarily to Southern Energy. This increase is
primarily the result of recovery of $29 million in receivables related to
Shajiao C reserved as uncollectible in 1999 which were partially offset by
various contract settlements and gains on asset sales that were recognized
during the first quarter of 1999.

     Interest on long-term debt. The increase in this item during the first
quarter of 2000 from the amount recorded in 1999 primarily reflects Southern
Energy's higher outstanding long-term debt.

     Interest on notes payable. This first quarter 2000 increase in interest on
notes payable when compared to the same period in 1999 is attributed primarily
to Southern Energy which had an increase of $23 million and, to a lesser extent,
SOUTHERN which had an increase of $11 million as a result of borrowings in
connection with its recently completed common stock repurchase program.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment, with non-traditional business becoming more
significant. For additional information relating to Southern Energy and other
businesses, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Southern Energy" and "Other Business" in
the Form 10-K. Also, reference is made to Note (N) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for information relating to the planned
initial public offering and subsequent spin-off of Southern Energy.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     On December 20, 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs. Reference is
made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings
Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for information on this matter.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Protection Agency Litigation" and Note 3 to the financial
statements of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by January 2001. This statement
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. SOUTHERN has not yet quantified the impact of adopting this
statement on its financial statements; however, the adoption could increase
volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) through (D), (F) through (J), (L), (M) and
(O) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion
of various contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings
potential. Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings"
herein.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first three months of
2000 included $539.6 million used for gross property additions to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were from
operations, short-term borrowings and other long-term debt. See SOUTHERN's
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details. Reference
is made to the SOUTHERN's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive
Income herein for information relating to other comprehensive income.

Financing Activities

During the first three months of 2000, maturities of the integrated Southeast
utilities' first mortgage bonds totaled $200 million. In February 2000, GEORGIA
issued $300 million of floating rate senior notes due February 22, 2002. The
proceeds of the sale were used to repay a portion of its outstanding short-term
indebtedness. In March 2000, MISSISSIPPI issued $100 million of floating rate
senior notes due March 28, 2002. The proceeds were used to prepay bank loans of
$45 million maturing in November 2001 and $5 million maturing in October 2002.
The balance was applied to repay a portion of its outstanding short-term
indebtedness.

     Reference is made to Note (M) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for discussion of a program to repurchase SOUTHERN's common
stock.

     The market price of SOUTHERN's common stock at March 31, 2000 was $21.75
per share and the book value was $13.59 per share, representing a market-to-book
ratio of 160%, compared to $23.50, $13.82 and 170%, respectively, at the end of
1999. The dividend for the first quarter of 2000 was $0.335 per share.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements for Construction", "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern electric
system's capital requirements for its construction program, sinking fund
requirements and maturing debt, and environmental compliance efforts.
Approximately $379 million will be required by March 31, 2001, for redemptions
and maturities of long-term debt. Also, the integrated Southeast utilities plan
to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and
preferred stock and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 2000, as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
March 31, 2000, approximately $471.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $5.9 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. These
unused credit arrangements also provide liquidity support to variable rate
pollution control bonds and commercial paper programs. At March 31, 2000, the
system companies had outstanding approximately $2.2 billion of short-term notes
payable and $2.3 billion of commercial paper. Management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

     See Note (D) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for discussion of financial derivative contracts entered into by SOUTHERN.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2000 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1999

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter of
2000 was $67.5 million compared to $63.1 million for the corresponding period of
1999. First quarter earnings increased $4.4 million or 7% primarily due to an
increase in operating revenues, which was partially offset by an increase in
operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenues increased for the first quarter 2000 due primarily
to a 3.1% increase in retail energy sales. Retail energy sales increased by
2.3%, 7.5% and 1.5% to residential, commercial and industrial customers,
respectively.

     Sales for resale-non-affiliates. Increased revenues from unit power energy
sales was the primary reason for the increase in the first quarter 2000 as
compared to the same period in 1999. Energy is usually sold at variable cost and
has no significant impact on net income.

     Sales for resale-affiliates. Revenues from sales to affiliated companies
within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
These transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. Increased amounts of purchased power were
needed to meet territorial demand in the first quarter of 2000 to offset
decreased nuclear and hydro power generation related to a refueling outage and
lower stream flows, respectively.

     Maintenance expense. These expenses increased due primarily to maintenance
performed on the fossil and nuclear power generation facilities.

     Interest income. This item was lower for the first quarter of 2000 when
compared to the first quarter of 1999 due primarily to a decrease in recognized
gains on investments held by the nuclear decommissioning trust. Interest income
related to the nuclear decommissioning trust was offset by a concurrent
reduction of other interest charges in accordance with FERC requirements.

     Interest on long-term debt. This first quarter 2000 increase compared to
the same period in 1999 is primarily due to the issuance of senior notes during
the last half of 1999.

     Other interest charges, net. The decrease in other interest charges for the
first quarter 2000 is primarily attributable to an increase in Allowance for
Funds Used During Construction resulting in a larger credit to interest expense
than was recorded in the corresponding period for 1999. Also, there was a
decrease in interest charges related to the nuclear decommissioning trust, which
was offset by a concurrent reduction of interest income in accordance with FERC
requirements.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, ALABAMA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     On December 20, 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs. Reference is
made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings
Potential" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K for information on this matter.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of ALABAMA in the
Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     The FASB has issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by January 2001. This
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. ALABAMA has not yet quantified the impact
of adopting this statement on its financial statements; however, the adoption
could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (F), (G) and (O) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first three months of
2000 included the addition of approximately $193.9 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Financing Activities

During the first three months of 2000, maturities of first mortgage bonds by
ALABAMA totaled $100 million. ALABAMA will continue to retire higher-cost debt
and preferred stock and replace these securities with lower-cost capital as
market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of ALABAMA
under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital requirements
for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental compliance
efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at March 31,
2000, approximately $18.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and had unused
committed lines of credit of approximately $907 million (including $418 million
of such lines under which borrowings may be made only to fund purchase
obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds). ALABAMA has
regulatory authority for up to $750 million of short-term borrowings. At March
31, 2000, ALABAMA had outstanding $322 million of commercial paper and $50
million of extendible commercial notes.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of March 31, 2000, and the related condensed statements of income for
the three-month periods ended March 31, 2000 and 1999 and cash flows for the
three-month periods ended March 31, 2000 and 1999. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of
December 31, 1999 (not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 16,
2000, we expressed an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the
information set forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December
31, 1999 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance
sheet from which it has been derived.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2000 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1999


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter of
2000 was $93.7 million compared to $91.6 million for the corresponding period in
1999. This $2.1 million or 2.3% increase in first quarter earnings was primarily
due to higher revenues and lower interest charges, partially offset by higher
depreciation and amortization expense.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                     Increase (Decrease)
                                             ----------------------------------
                                                      First Quarter
                                             ----------------------------------
                                               (in thousands)        %
Retail sales.............................         $47,251            5.5
Sales for resale - affiliates............           4,027           50.9
Other operating revenues.................           7,497           38.5
Fuel expense.............................          32,695           18.3
Purchased power from non-affiliates .....          10,952           34.1
Purchased power from affiliates..........          (7,181)         (13.1)
Other operation expense..................          (9,299)          (5.5)
Maintenance expense......................           6,597            7.2
Depreciation and amortization expense....          25,332           19.1
Interest on long-term debt...............          (2,239)          (5.4)


     Retail sales. Retail sales revenues, excluding fuel revenues which
generally do not affect income, increased $17.5 million during the first quarter
of 2000 when compared to the same period in 1999 due primarily to a 4.7%
increase in retail energy sales. This increase had no significant effect on
earnings due to additional depreciation and amortization under GEORGIA's retail
rate order as discussed below.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company. These transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operating revenues. This first quarter increase is mainly due to
recognition of the open-access transmission tariff settlement in 1999.

     Fuel expense. The increase in this expense for the first quarter 2000, when
compared to the corresponding period of 1999, is primarily a result of increased
generation to meet energy demands and lower hydro generation in 2000 when
compared to 1999.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The first quarter of 2000 increase
when compared to the same period of 1999 results from higher demand for energy.

     Other operation expense. For the current quarter of 2000 these expenses
decreased when compared to the corresponding period in 1999 due primarily to
lower injuries and damages claims and a larger nuclear insurance refund.

     Maintenance expense. These costs increased during the first quarter of 2000
as compared to the first quarter of 1999 due primarily to maintenance performed
on nuclear plant and distribution lines.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in this first quarter
when compared to the same period in 1999 is a result of increased plant and
equipment in service and accelerated amortization and depreciation required
under the three-year rate order which became effective in January 1, 1999. See
Note (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further
details regarding the retail rate order.

     Interest on long-term debt. The decrease in this charge during the first
quarter of 2000 compared to the same period in 1999 is primarily due to the
refinancing of higher cost debt.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including weather, regulatory matters and energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GEORGIA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form
10-K.

     Effective January 1, 1999, GEORGIA began operating under a new three-year
retail rate order. Under the order, GEORGIA's earnings are evaluated against a
retail return on common equity range of 10% to 12.5%. In compliance with the
order, retail rates were decreased by $24 million on an annual basis effective
January 1, 2000. Reference is made to Note (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     Effective June 1, 2000, the Georgia PSC will modify the calculation of
prices under certain of GEORGIA's retail commercial and industrial rates. These
modifications will reduce retail revenues by approximately $14 million in 2000
and $20 million in 2001.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings. For additional information, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the
Form 10-K.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by January 2001. This statement
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts - and for
hedging activities. GEORGIA has not yet quantified the impact of adopting this
statement on its financial statements; however, the adoption could increase
volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (H), (I) and (O) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first three months
of 2000 was the addition of approximately $212 million to gross plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations. See GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

During the first three months of 2000, maturities of first mortgage bonds by
GEORGIA totaled $100 million. In February 2000, GEORGIA issued $300 million of
floating rate senior notes due February 22, 2002. The proceeds of the sale were
used to repay a portion of its outstanding short-term indebtedness. GEORGIA
plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt
and preferred stock and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Issues" in the
Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital requirements for its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at March 31,
2000, approximately $13 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$1.5 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. The credit arrangements
provide liquidity support to GEORGIA's obligations with respect to variable rate
pollution control bonds and its commercial paper program. At March 31, 2000,
GEORGIA had $134.8 million and $451.3 million outstanding in short-term notes
payable to banks and commercial paper, respectively. Management believes that
the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit
without maintaining large cash balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of March 31, 2000, and the related condensed
statements of income for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2000 and 1999
and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2000 and 1999. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of
December 31, 1999 (not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 16,
2000, we expressed an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the
information set forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December
31, 1999, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance
sheet from which it has been derived.

                               GULF POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2000 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1999


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter of
2000 was $4.7 million compared to $4.8 million for the same period in 1999. The
slight decrease in earnings was primarily due to an increase in total interest
charges and other, net.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                     Increase (Decrease)
                                             ----------------------------------
                                                        First Quarter
                                             ---------------------------------
                                                (in thousands)         %
Retail sales................................        9,526              8.9
Sales for resale - affiliates...............        1,596             22.6
Other operating revenues....................       (6,914)           (77.2)
Fuel expense................................        2,890              7.5
Purchased power from non-affiliates ........        2,458             59.1
Maintenance expense.........................       (2,417)           (14.6)
Interest on long-term debt..................          670             13.5

     Retail sales. Excluding recovery of fuel expense and certain other expenses
that do not effect net income, retail sales revenues remained relatively flat
during the first quarter of 2000 when compared to the first quarter of 1999.
Retail energy sales increased 5.3% during the first three months of 2000 when
compared to the same period of the prior year due, mostly, to growth in the
number of retail customers served by GULF. Retail energy sales to residential,
commercial and industrial customers were up 5.4%, 5.3% and 4.8%, respectively.
This increase in energy sales was offset, for the most part, by retail base rate
reductions and the recording of estimated revenues to be shared under GULF's
Sharing Plan, which was approved by the Florida PSC in October 1999. For
additional information regarding the reduction to retail base rates and the
Sharing Plan, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     Sales for resale - affiliates. Revenues from sales for resale to affiliated
companies within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operating revenues. This decrease in the first quarter of 2000 when
compared to the same period in 1999 is mainly due to a decrease in fuel,
conservation and capacity clause revenues. The decrease in these revenues was a
result of adjustments to reflect differences between recoverable costs and the
amounts actually reflected in current rates. The recovery provisions generally
equal the related expenses and have no material effect on net income.

     Fuel expense. The increase in fuel expense for the first three months of
2000 when compared to the same period in 1999 can be attributed, for the most
part, to increased generation due to a higher demand for energy and a higher
average cost of fuel consumed.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. This increase in the first quarter
2000 when compared to the same period in 1999 is attributed primarily to an
increase in energy purchases due to increased power marketing activities, the
majority of which were resold to non-affiliated third parties. These
transactions had no significant effect on net income.

     Maintenance expense. These expenses decreased in the first quarter of 2000
when compared to the first quarter of 1999 mainly due to scheduled outages
during the first quarter of 1999.

     Interest on long-term debt.   This increase for the first quarter of 2000
is primarily due to the sale of senior notes during the third quarter of 1999.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GULF is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

      On November 4, 1999, the Florida PSC approved GULF's plan to reduce its
authorized rate of return, reduce retail base rates and share revenues with its
customers. For additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     On December 20, 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs. Reference is
made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings
Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K for information on this matter.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Protection Agency Litigation" and Note 3 to the financial
statements of GULF in the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by January 2001. This statement
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. GULF has not yet quantified the impact of adopting this
statement on its financial statements; however, the adoption could increase
volatility in earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (O) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first three months of
2000 included the addition of approximately $18.6 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

GULF plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost
debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and "Other
Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of GULF's capital
requirements for its construction program, environmental compliance efforts and
maturing debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at March 31,
2000, approximately $1.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $41.5 million
of unused committed lines of credit with banks in addition to $61.9 million
liquidity support for GULF's obligations with respect to variable rate pollution
control bonds. At March 31, 2000, GULF had $52.5 million outstanding of notes
payable to banks. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

                            MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2000 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1999

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first
quarter of 2000 was $6.7 million compared to $7.2 million for the corresponding
period of 1999. Earnings during this first quarter of 2000 were down as a 10%
increase in operating revenues was offset by a 11.3% increase in operating
expenses and a 16.7% increase in total interest charges and other, net.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                    Increase (Decrease)
                                               -------------------------------
                                                      First Quarter
                                               -------------------------------
                                                 (in thousands)        %
Retail sales................................         $8,944            9.7
Sales for resale - affiliates...............          3,546          342.6
Other operating revenues....................            447           20.8
Fuel expense................................          5,538           17.6
Purchased power from non-affiliates ........          1,663           70.9
Purchased power from affiliates.............          2,720           30.6
Maintenance expense.........................          1,336           11.5
Interest on notes payable...................            633          153.6


     Retail sales. Retail sales revenues were up in the first quarter due to a
9.9% increase in retail energy sales which resulted from growth in the number of
customers. Energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers
during the first quarter of 2000 when compared to the same period in 1999 were
up 4.8%, 9.7% and 12.4%, respectively.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operating revenues. The increase in these revenues primarily reflects
increased revenues from the transmission of electricity for others.

     Fuel expense. During the first quarter of 2000 compared to the same period
in 1999, fuel expense increased due to higher demand for energy.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increase in the current quarter
when compared to the same period in 1999 is reflective of increased demand for
energy.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Maintenance expense. This expense was up during the first quarter of 2000
as compared to the corresponding period of 1999 principally due to additional
maintenance performed on steam power generation facilities.

     Interest on notes payable. This item has increased due primarily to
increased borrowing at higher interest rates during the first quarter of 2000
compared to the same period in 1999.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment. Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in
rates under the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force
on electric rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking place. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K. See Note (J) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for information regarding
an agreement between MISSISSIPPI and certain of its wholesale customers to
reduce rates.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, MISSISSIPPI is positioning
the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. MISSISSIPPI's 2000 ECO Plan filing was approved, as
filed, by the Mississippi PSC on March 22, 2000 and resulted in a slight
decrease in customer prices. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     On December 20, 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs. Reference is
made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings
Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K for information on this matter.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in
the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     In May 2000, the Mississippi PSC ordered that its docket reviewing
restructuring of the electric industry in the State of Mississippi be suspended.
The Mississippi PSC found that retail competition may not be in the public
interest at this time and ordered that no further formal hearings would be held
on this subject. It found that the current regulatory structure had produced
reliable low cost power and "should not be changed without clear and convincing
demonstration that change would be in the public interest." The Mississippi PSC
will continue to monitor retail and wholesale restructuring activities
throughout the United States and reserved "its right to order further formal
hearings on the matter should new evidence demonstrate that retail competition
would be in the public interest and all customers could receive a reduction in
the total cost of their electric service."

                            MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by January 2001. This statement
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. MISSISSIPPI has not yet quantified the impact of adopting
this statement on its financial statements; however, the adoption could increase
volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (J) and (O) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first three months
of 2000 included the addition of approximately $16.4 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
for further details.

Financing Activities

In March 2000, MISSISSIPPI issued $100 million of floating rate senior notes due
March 28, 2002. The proceeds were used to prepay bank loans of $45 million
maturing in November 2001 and $5 million maturing in October 2002. The balance
was applied to repay a portion of its outstanding short-term indebtedness.
MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" and Note 3 to the financial statements
in the Form 10-K for a description of MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its
construction program, environmental compliance efforts, sinking fund
requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at March
31, 2000, approximately $192 thousand of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $124.3 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks.
At March 31, 2000, MISSISSIPPI had short-term notes payable outstanding of $27
million. Management believes that the need for working capital can be adequately
met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2000 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1999


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter
of 2000 was $1.6 million as compared to $1.2 million for the corresponding
period of 1999. First quarter 2000 earnings were up due primarily to increased
operating revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                 Increase (Decrease)
                                             -------------------------------
                                                      First Quarter
                                             -------------------------------
                                               (in thousands)        %
Retail sales.............................          $3,978            8.7
Sales for resale - affiliates............           1,355          370.2
Fuel expense.............................           3,154           47.8
Purchased power from non-affiliates......           1,096          100.4
Purchased power from affiliates..........          (1,127)         (12.3)
Interest on notes payable................             432            N/M

N/M - Not meaningful

     Retail sales. Retail sales revenues were higher in the first quarter of
2000 than in the same period of the prior year due to an 8% increase in retail
energy sales. Energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers
were up by 8.4%, 9.9% and 5.8%, respectively. These energy sales increases were
a direct result of growth in the number of customers.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. This first quarter 2000 increase over the corresponding
period in 1999 is principally due to increased demand for energy and increased
use of higher cost fuel.

      Purchased power from non-affiliates. This expense increased in the first
quarter of 2000 reflecting the increased demand for energy and increased costs
for purchased power.

      Interest on notes payable. For the first quarter of 2000, these expenses
increased from the same period in 1999 due primarily to SAVANNAH's purchase
during 1999 of long-term fixed rate debt with the proceeds from lower cost
short-term debt. This short-term debt is being carried until there is a
favorable opportunity to refinance.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     In 1998, the Georgia PSC approved a four-year accounting order for
SAVANNAH. Reference is made to Note (K) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SAVANNAH is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     On December 20, 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs. Reference is
made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings
Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K for information on this matter.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of SAVANNAH in
the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by January 2001. This statement
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. SAVANNAH has not yet quantified the impact of adopting this
statement on its financial statements; however, the adoption could increase
volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (K) and (O) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first three months of
2000 included the addition of approximately $7 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations and credit arrangements with banks. See SAVANNAH's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at March 31,
2000, approximately $3.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$42.1 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. At March 31, 2000,
SAVANNAH had $33.9 million outstanding of notes payable to banks. Since SAVANNAH
has no major generating plants under construction, management believes that the
need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)   The condensed financial statements of the registrants included herein
      have been prepared by each registrant, without audit,
      pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.  In the opinion of each
      registrant's management, the information regarding
      such registrant furnished herein reflects all adjustments necessary to
      present fairly the results of operations for the periods
      ended March 31, 2000 and 1999.  Certain information and footnote
      disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
      in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted  in the
      United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to
      such rules and regulations, although each registrant believes that the
      disclosures regarding such registrant are adequate to
      make the information presented not misleading.  It is suggested that
      these condensed financial statements of each registrant be
      read in conjunction with the financial statements of such registrant and
      the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K.  Certain
      prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current
      period presentation.  Due to seasonal variations in the
      demand for energy, operating results for the periods presented do not
      necessarily indicate operating results for the entire year.

      The condensed financial statements of ALABAMA and GEORGIA included herein
      have been reviewed by ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's independent public
      accountants as set forth in their reports included herein as Exhibit 1 to
      ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)   SOUTHERN's operating affiliates are subject to the provisions of FASB
      Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
      Regulation. In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no
      longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
      off related unrecoverable regulatory assets and liabilities, and determine
      if any other assets have been impaired. For additional information, see
      Note 1 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the
      Form 10-K.

(C)   The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
      practices of the electric utility industry--including
      SOUTHERN's--regarding the recognition, measurement and classification of
      decommissioning costs for nuclear generating facilities in the financial
      statements. In response to these questions, the FASB has decided to review
      the accounting for obligations related to the retirement of long-lived
      assets, including nuclear decommissioning. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
      SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial
      statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA under "Depreciation and
      Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)   SOUTHERN engages in price risk management activities. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Derivative Financial Instruments"
      and Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for a discussion of these activities. Activities for non-trading
      purposes consist of transactions that are employed to mitigate SOUTHERN's
      risk related to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate
      fluctuations. At March 31, 2000, the status of outstanding non-trading
      related derivative contracts was as follows:

      In January 1998, Southern Energy and Vastar Resources, Inc. combined their
      energy trading and marketing activities to form a joint venture. Southern
      Energy's investment in the joint venture is accounted for under the equity
      method of accounting. SOUTHERN and Vastar have made guarantees to certain
      counterparties regarding performance of contractual commitments by the
      joint venture. At March 31, 2000, outstanding guarantees related to the
      estimated fair value of net contractual commitments were approximately
      $196.8 million. Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
      - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 5 to
      the financial statements of SOUTHERN under the captions "Financial
      Instruments for Trading Activities" and "Energy Trading and Marketing
      Commitments", respectively, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(E)   SOUTHERN's principal business segment -- or its traditional business -- is
      the five integrated Southeast utilities that provide electric service in
      four states. The other reportable business segment is non-traditional
      energy services provided by Southern Energy, which develops and manages
      electricity and other energy-related projects both in the United States
      and abroad. Intersegment revenues are not material. Financial data for
      business segments for the periods covered in the Form 10-Q are as follows:

       (Note) The all other category includes parent SOUTHERN, which does not
      allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category
      includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate
      disclosure. These segments include a wireless communication company and a
      developmental company for energy products and services. Amounts for
      Southern Energy exclude interest expense to parent SOUTHERN.

(F)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information
      relating to retail rate adjustment procedures.

(G)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to a judgment
      against ALABAMA arising from discharges into Lake Martin.

(H)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information
      concerning a three-year rate order approved by the Georgia PSC effective
      January 1, 1999. The order decreased annual retail
      rates by $262 million effective January 1, 1999 and by an additional
      $24 million effective January 1, 2000.  The order further
      provides for $85 million each year, plus up to $50 million annually of
      any earnings in excess of a 12.5% retail return on common
      equity during the second and third years, to be applied to accelerated
      amortization or depreciation of assets.  Two-thirds of
      any additional earnings above the 12.5% return will be applied to rate
      reductions and the remaining one-third retained by
      GEORGIA.  Pursuant to this provision, GEORGIA recognized accelerated
      amortization of  $36.6 million in the first quarter of 2000
      and $21.3 million in the first quarter of 1999.

(I)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
      designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
      Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
      environmental contingencies.

(J)   In April 2000, MISSISSIPPI reached an agreement with certain of its
      wholesale customers to reduce its rates effective
      January 1, 2000.  The agreement results in an annual rate reduction of
      approximately $3 million and a temporary annualized rate
      reduction of approximately $3 million for a period of 18 months ending
      June 30, 2001.  MISSISSIPPI and its customers will file
      the agreement with the FERC for its approval.  In anticipation of FERC
      approval, MISSISSIPPI recognized a liability for
      approximately $1.5 million in revenues subject to refund during the first
      quarter ended March 31, 2000 related to energy
      delivered during the first quarter.  In addition, MISSISSIPPI and its
      customers agreed that neither party would seek a
      unilateral change to the new rates prior to January 1, 2002, except for
      changes due to the operation of the fuel cost adjustment
      clause under the tariff.

(K)   In 1998, the Georgia PSC approved a new accounting order for SAVANNAH.
      Under this order, SAVANNAH will reduce electric rates to its small
      business customers, expense additional storm damage accruals and accrue
      additional depreciation on generating assets. For additional information
      concerning the four-year accounting order approved by the Georgia PSC in
      June 1998, reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of
      SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)



(L)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in
      Item 8 and to Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of the Form
      10-K for information relating to (i) petitions for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
      relief which were filed in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court
      for the Southern District of Alabama and (ii) proposed settlement
      discussions among the affected parties.   At March 31, 2000,
      Mobile Energy had total assets of $391.9 million and senior debt
      outstanding of $190 million of first mortgage bonds and $72.2
      million related to tax-exempt bonds.  In connection with the bond
      financings, SOUTHERN provided certain limited guarantees, in
      lieu of funding debt service and maintenance reserve accounts with cash.
      As of March 31, 2000, under an agreement with the
      bondholders, SOUTHERN had paid $38.3 million pursuant to the guarantees.
      SOUTHERN continues to have guarantees outstanding of
      certain potential environmental and other obligations of Mobile Energy
      that represent a maximum contingent liability of $21
      million at March 31, 2000.  The final outcome of this matter cannot now
      be determined.

(M)   In April 1999, SOUTHERN's board approved the repurchase of up to 50
      million shares of SOUTHERN's common stock over the next two years through
      open market or privately negotiated transactions. The program did not
      establish a target stock price or timetable for specific repurchases. As
      of March 31, 2000, a total of 50 million shares had been purchased, thus
      completing the program.

(N)   On April 17, 2000, SOUTHERN announced that its board of directors approved
      an initial public offering of up to 19.9 percent of its Southern Energy
      subsidiary. SOUTHERN also announced that it is planning to spin-off to
      holders of SOUTHERN common stock the remaining ownership of Southern
      Energy within 12 months of the initial public offering. The spin-off will
      be subject to a number of market and other conditions. Reference is made
      to SOUTHERN's Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 17, 2000 for
      additional information.

      On April 21, 2000, Southern Energy filed a registration statement with the
      SEC for the initial public offering of Southern Energy shares. The
      offering is expected to take place as soon as practicable after the
      effective date of the registration statement.

(O)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN,
      ALABAMA , GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for information on EPA Litigation.

PART II       -  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.          Legal Proceedings.

(1)  An administrative  law judge held hearings in March 2000 in connection with
     a FERC  proceeding  that will  determine the percentage of a settled $158.8
     million  revenue  requirement  for the  period  from June 1,  1999  through
     December 31, 2001 to be paid to Southern Energy California,  L.L.C. and its
     subsidiaries  (collectively,  "SE California")  under reliability  must-run
     agreements  between SE California  and the  California  Independent  System
     Operator  ("CAISO").  SE California has proposed to allocate  approximately
     75% of the  responsibility  for payment of the revenue  requirement  to the
     CAISO, while CAISO and other aligned parties argue that CAISO should pay no
     more than  approximately  7%. The outcome of this proceeding  cannot now be
     determined.


(2)  Reference is made to the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
     for information  regarding certain legal and administrative  proceedings in
     which SOUTHERN and its reporting subsidiaries are involved.
