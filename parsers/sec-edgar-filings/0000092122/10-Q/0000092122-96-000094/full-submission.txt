                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   SECOND QUARTER 1996 vs. SECOND QUARTER 1995
                                       AND
                     YEAR-TO-DATE 1996 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 1995


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SOUTHERN's  consolidated net income for the second quarter and year-to-date 1996
was  $287  million  ($0.43  per  share)  and $520  million  ($0.78  per  share),
respectively, compared to $268 million ($0.40 per share) and $474 million ($0.71
per  share)  for  the  corresponding   periods  of  1995.  This  resulted  in  a
consolidated net income increase of 7.4% for the quarter and 9.8%  year-to-date.
Colder-than-normal  weather  during the first three  months of 1996 coupled with
warmer-than-usual  weather  during late spring and early  summer  increased  the
demand for electricity by residential and commercial  customers which positively
affected  earnings of the core  business.  The  performance  of the  SEI-related
portion of the business (primarily resulting from the acquisition of SWEB in the
third quarter of 1995) also  contributed  to the  improvement  in 1996 earnings.
(Reference  is made to Note 14 of SOUTHERN's  financial  statements in Item 8 of
the Form 10-K for  additional  information  regarding the  acquisition  of SWEB.
Reference  is also made to "Future  Earnings  Potential"  below  relating to the
sale, in July 1996, of a 25% share of SWEB to PP&L Resources, Inc.)

     SOUTHERN's  core  business is primarily  represented  by its five  domestic
electric  utility  operating  companies,  which provide electric service in four
Southeastern  states.  Another  significant  portion of  SOUTHERN's  business is
represented by SEI, which owns and manages international and domestic businesses
for SOUTHERN.  Businesses acquired by SEI have been included in the consolidated
statements of income since the date of acquisition. Certain changes in operating
revenues and expenses from the prior period are the result of such acquisitions.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the
following:

     Operating revenues. The increase in operating revenues of the core business
was influenced  most heavily by an increase in the amount of retail energy sold.
For the second quarter and year-to-date 1996, total retail  kilowatt-hour  sales
increased  4.7% and 6.3%,  respectively,  over the same periods of 1995.  Retail
revenues,  excluding those revenues which represent the pass-through of fuel and
certain other expenses and do not affect  income,  increased $58 million for the
second quarter and $127 million year-to-date 1996.  Residential energy sales for
the second quarter and year-to-date 1996 increased 7.6% and 10.3%, respectively,

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


primarily due to favorable  weather  conditions and an increase in the number of
customers  served.  The same factors  affected  commercial  energy sales for the
second  quarter  and   year-to-date   1996,   which  increased  5.8%  and  7.9%,
respectively.  Weather was also a factor in increased  wholesale  energy  sales,
which  were up 8.6% and 17.6%  compared  to the  corresponding  periods of 1995.
However,  capacity  revenues from off-system  sales were down $2 million for the
second quarter and $20 million  year-to-date 1996 primarily due to the scheduled
decline in  megawatts  of capacity  under  long-term  contracts  compared to the
previous  periods  of  1995.  For the  second  quarter  and  year-to-date  1996,
operating  revenues  applicable  to  SEI-related  activities  increased  by $279
million and $636 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods
of 1995. The primary reason for these  increases  relates to the  acquisition of
SWEB.

     Purchased  power  expense.  The  substantial  increase in  purchased  power
expense  is  attributable  to  SEI-related  activities,   specifically,   SWEB's
operations.  (SWEB's main business is the  distribution of electricity.  It must
purchase  essentially  all of its power.)  Purchased  power  expense in the core
business increased only 2.5% or $1 million for the second quarter and 3.5% or $4
million for year-to-date 1996.

     Maintenance  expense.  Maintenance  expense  related  to the core  business
increased  $21 million or 12.9% for the second  quarter and $33 million or 10.3%
for year-to-date 1996 compared to the  corresponding  periods of 1995 due to the
timing of scheduled  maintenance  performed  on  generating  units.  SEI-related
activities accounted for the remainder.

     Depreciation  and  amortization  expense.   Depreciation  and  amortization
expense  in the core  business  increased  $14  million  or 6.9% for the  second
quarter  and  $31  million  or  7.6%  for  year-to-date  1996  compared  to  the
corresponding  periods  of  1995  mainly  due  to  accelerated  depreciation  of
generating plants and additional plant investment.
SEI-related activities accounted for the remainder.

     Taxes  other than income  taxes.  For the second  quarter and  year-to-date
1996, taxes other than income taxes associated with the core business  increased
$1  million  or 1.1% and $11  million  or 4.5%,  respectively,  compared  to the
corresponding  periods  of 1995  primarily  due to higher  municipal  and county
franchise taxes resulting from increased sales. SEI-related activities accounted
for the remainder.

     Interest on long-term debt.  After excluding those amounts  attributable to
SEI-related business activities, interest on long-term debt in the core business
decreased  $20 million  (15.4%) for the second  quarter and $38 million  (14.7%)
year-to-date 1996 compared to the  corresponding  periods of 1995 reflecting the
redemption and refinancing of long-term debt by the operating companies.

     Interest on notes payable.  After excluding  those amounts  attributable to
SEI-related business activities,  interest on notes payable increased $2 million
or 16.6% for the  current  quarter  and $8  million or 29.6%  year-to-date  1996
reflecting higher amounts of short-term debt outstanding.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment, with SEI and other business becoming more significant.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     With respect to SEI-related  activities,  SOUTHERN received, in April 1996,
an order  from the SEC  which  in  effect  allows  it to use the  proceeds  from
financings  to  increase  its  aggregate  investment  in EWGs and FUCOs up to an
amount not exceeding 100% of SOUTHERN's  consolidated retained earnings. At June
30, 1996, SOUTHERN's  consolidated retained earnings amounted to $3,580 million,
and its aggregate  investment in EWGs and FUCOs amounted to $1,275 million.  For
additional  information  relating to SOUTHERN's  SEI-related  and other business
activities, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "New Business Development" in the Form 10-K.
In  addition to the  discussion  in the Form 10-K  relating to SWEB,  on July 1,
1996, SEI sold, indirectly, a 25% share in SWEB to PP&L Resources, Inc. for some
$185 million.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is  positioning  the business to meet the challenge of  increasing  competition.
Legislation  has been  enacted in Alabama  that would  establish  a process  for
determining  whether  utilities  would  experience  "stranded  costs"  upon  the
transfer of an existing customer of a utility to another electric supplier. This
legislation  authorizes  the  Alabama  PSC to make a  determination  of  whether
stranded  costs  would  exist as a result of such a transfer  by a  customer  of
ALABAMA and would require the customer  seeking an  alternative  supplier to pay
any stranded costs found to exist.  The legislation  has termination  provisions
keyed  to  passage  of  comprehensive   retail  electric   service   competition
legislation which addresses  stranded costs of existing utilities and eliminates
the  obligation of utilities to provide  generating  resources.  For  additional
information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  "Competition"  and  Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS - "Future  Earnings  Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset.  For additional  information about the Clean Air Act and
other  environmental  issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (B),  (C),  (E),  (F),  (H), (J), (K), (L), (M),
(O), (P) and (S) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for
discussion  of various  contingencies  and other matters which may affect future
earnings  potential.  Reference  is  also  made  to  Part  II - Item 1 -  "Legal
Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first half of 1996
was the addition of  approximately  $643 million to utility plant. The funds for
these  additions  and other capital  requirements  were derived  primarily  from
operations and increased short-term debt. See SOUTHERN's Condensed Statements of
Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first half of 1996, the operating companies sold $60 million of first
mortgage bonds, and through public authorities, $85 million of pollution control
revenue bonds.  Retirements,  including maturities,  of the operating companies'
first mortgage bonds and pollution control revenue bonds totaled $322 million. A
subsidiary of ALABAMA  formed as a statutory  business trust sold $97 million of
trust preferred securities guaranteed by ALABAMA and loaned the proceeds of such
securities to ALABAMA. See Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for further details.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     During  the  first  half of 1996,  SOUTHERN  raised  $96  million  from the
issuance of new common stock under  SOUTHERN's  various stock plans.  The market
price of SOUTHERN's  common stock at June 30, 1996 was $24.625 per share and the
book  value was $13.26 per share,  representing  a  market-to-book  ratio of 186
percent, compared to $24.625, $13.10 and 188 percent,  respectively,  at the end
of 1995. The dividend for the second quarter of 1996 was 31.5 cents per share.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of SOUTHERN
under  "Capital  Requirements  for  Construction,"  "Environmental  Matters" and
"Other Capital  Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern
electric   system's  capital   requirements   for  its   construction   program,
environmental  compliance efforts,  sinking fund requirements and maturing debt.
Approximately  $203  million  will be  required  by June 30,  1997,  for present
sinking fund  requirements,  redemption  of preferred  stock and  maturities  of
long-term debt. Also, the operating subsidiaries plan to continue, to the extent
possible,  a program to retire  higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace
these securities with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the  financing  activities  previously  described,  SOUTHERN  may
require  additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of  additional  equity  capital  to be raised in 1996,  as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources  similar to those used in the past.  The amount,  type and
timing of any  financings--if  needed--will  depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings,  regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors.
Currently,  each of the operating  companies  expects to have adequate  earnings
coverage  ratios for any  anticipated  security sales through at least 1998. See
Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing  Programs"  in the Form  10-K  for  additional
information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
June 30,  1996,  approximately  $620  million of cash and cash  equivalents  and
approximately  $4.0 billion of unused credit  arrangements with banks (including
$745 million of such  arrangements  under which  borrowings  may be made only to
fund purchase  obligations of the operating  companies relating to variable rate
pollution control bonds). At June 30, 1996, the system companies had outstanding
approximately  $1.4  billion of  short-term  notes  payable and $1.2  billion of
commercial paper.  Since SOUTHERN's  construction  program with respect to major
generating projects in the core business has been completed, management believes
that the need for working  capital can be adequately  met by utilizing  lines of
credit without maintaining large cash balances.

     See Note (D) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for discussion of
financial derivative contracts entered into by SOUTHERN.

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses  and do not affect net income,  revenues  for the second  quarter  1996
increased $12.4 million and year-to-date 1996 increased $34.1 million,  compared
to the  corresponding  periods of 1995.  The increase in revenues was influenced
most  heavily  by  an  increase  in  the  amount  of  retail  energy  sold.  For
year-to-date 1996, total retail kilowatt-hour sales increased 6.3% over the same
period of 1995, and retail  revenues,  excluding fuel revenues,  increased $36.2
million.  Residential,  commercial and industrial  energy sales increased 10.1%,
11.4% and 1.3%, respectively.  Weather and a strong economy in ALABAMA's service
territory had a positive effect on retail sales.

     Revenues  from  affiliates.  Revenues  from sales to  affiliated  companies
within the Southern electric system,  as well as purchases of energy,  will vary
from  period  to period  depending  on  demand,  the  availability,  and cost of
generating  resources  at  each  company.  These  transactions  did  not  have a
significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel  expense.  The  increase in fuel  expense  for the second  quarter and
year-to-date  1996 as  compared  to the  corresponding  periods  of 1995  can be
attributed  to higher  generation  necessary  to meet the  increased  demand for
electricity.

     Interest  income.  Interest  income was  reduced in May 1995,  pursuant  to
litigation,  as a result of a charge of $9  million  to  reflect  the  refund of
interest on the sales of merchandise by vendors other than ALABAMA. In addition,
interest income increased  approximately $5 million for year-to-date 1996 as the

result of the recognition of gains from the sales of securities from the nuclear
decommissioning  trust.  This  increase  in income  was  offset by a  concurrent
recognition of other interest charges in accordance with FERC requirements.

     Other,  net. For the second  quarter  1996,  donations,  contributions  and
injuries and damages expenses were approximately $9.0 million higher than in the
corresponding  period of 1995.  To a lesser  extent,  these  same  factors  also
contributed to the year-to-date  1996 period, in addition to a $5.6 million gain
on the disposition of property which was recognized in 1995.

     Income taxes  applicable to other  income.  In June 1996,  ALABAMA  donated
certain nonutility property to the Economic Development  Partnership of Alabama.
This donation resulted in a reduction of income taxes applicable to other income
of approximately $10.6 million.

     Interest on  long-term  debt.  The decline in  interest on  long-term  debt
reflects the redemption  and  refinancing of long-term debt over the past twelve
months.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is  positioning  the business to meet the challenge of  increasing  competition.
Legislation  has been  enacted in Alabama  that would  establish  a process  for
determining  whether  utilities  would  experience  "stranded  costs"  upon  the
transfer of an existing customer of a utility to another electric supplier. This
legislation  authorizes  the  Alabama  PSC to make a  determination  of  whether
stranded  costs  would  exist as a result of such a transfer  by a  customer  of
ALABAMA and would require the customer  seeking an  alternative  supplier to pay
any stranded costs found to exist.  The legislation  has termination  provisions
keyed  to  passage  of  comprehensive   retail  electric   service   competition
legislation which addresses  stranded costs of existing utilities and eliminates
the  obligation of utilities to provide  generating  resources.  For  additional
information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  "Competition"  and  Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS - "Future  Earnings  Potential"  of ALABAMA in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset.  For additional  information about the Clean Air Act and
other  environmental  issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (B),  (C), (F), (H) and (S) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial  Statements" herein for discussion of various  contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.  Reference is also

                              ALABAMA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in ALABAMA's  financial condition during the first half of 1996
was the addition of approximately $221.0 million to utility plant. The funds for
these  additions  and other capital  requirements  were derived  primarily  from
operating activities and an increase in short-term debt. See ALABAMA's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first quarter of 1996,  maturities and  redemptions of first mortgage
bonds of ALABAMA totaled $83.8 million.  Also,  Alabama Power Capital Trust I, a
statutory  business trust  established for the sole purpose of holding ALABAMA's
junior subordinated notes and issuing preferred securities,  sold $97,000,000 of
its 7.375% trust preferred  securities which are guaranteed by ALABAMA. See Note
(I) to the  Condensed  Financial  Statements  herein  for  further  details.  No
additional  securities  were  issued,  redeemed  or  matured  during  the second
quarter.

     ALABAMA will continue to retire  higher-cost  debt and preferred  stock and
replace these securities with lower-cost capital, as market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS of ALABAMA
under "Capital  Requirements,"  "Other Capital  Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description  of ALABAMA's  capital  requirements
for  its  construction  program,  maturing  debt  and  environmental  compliance
efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing  activities  previously  described herein,  ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds  required for  construction  and other  purposes  from
sources  similar to those used in the past.  The amount,  type and timing of any
financings--if  needed--will  depend  upon  maintenance  of  adequate  earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
ALABAMA  expects to have adequate  earnings  coverage ratios for any anticipated
security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet  short-term cash needs and  contingencies,  ALABAMA had at June 30,
1996, approximately $18.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and had committed
lines of credit of approximately  $608 million with regulatory  authority for up
to  $750  million  of  short-term  borrowing.  At June  30,  1996,  ALABAMA  had
outstanding  $15.0  million  of  short-term  notes  payable  to banks and $460.0
million of commercial paper.  Since ALABAMA has no major generating plants under
construction,  management  believes  that the need for  working  capital  can be
adequately  met by  utilizing  lines of credit  without  maintaining  large cash
balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying  condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of June 30, 1996, and the related condensed  statements of income for
the  three-month  and  six-month  periods  ended  June 30,  1996 and  1995,  and
condensed statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 1996
and 1995.  These financial  statements are the  responsibility  of the Company's
management.

     We conducted our review in accordance  with  standards  established  by the
American  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants.  A  review  of  interim
financial  information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial  data and making  inquiries of persons  responsible  for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the  expression  of an opinion  regarding the  financial  statements  taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review,  we are not aware of any material  modifications  that
should be made to the financial  statements  referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously  audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards,  the balance  sheet of ALABAMA  POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1995
(not presented  herein) and, in our report dated February 21, 1996, we expressed
an unqualified  opinion on that statement.  In our opinion,  the information set
forth in the  accompanying  condensed  balance  sheet as of December 31, 1995 is
fairly stated, in all material  respects,  in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after  dividends on preferred  stock for the second quarter
and  year-to-date  1996 was $154.3  million  and $268.7  million,  respectively,
compared to $148.5 million and $264.7 million for the  corresponding  periods of
1995. Earnings increased by 3.9% for the quarter and 1.5% year-to-date primarily
as a result of increased retail revenues and lower interest costs.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses and do not affect  income,  revenues for the second  quarter  increased
$50.5 million and for  year-to-date  increased  $76.9  million,  compared to the
corresponding  periods of 1995.  The  increase in revenues was  influenced  most
heavily by an increase in the amount of retail energy sold. Retail kilowatt-hour
sales increased 6.1% for the current  quarter and 6.6%  year-to-date as compared
to the corresponding periods of 1995. Retail revenues,  excluding fuel revenues,
increased  5.7% or  $42.8  million  for the  current  quarter  and 5.4% or $76.6
million  year-to-date.  Residential,  commercial and industrial energy sales for
the second quarter and  year-to-date  1996 increased  10.4% and 10.7%;  5.2% and
6.9%;  and 4.3% and 3.7%,  respectively.  Warmer-than-usual  weather during late
spring and a slight  increase in the number of  customers  served had a positive
effect on retail sales.  Energy sales to non-affiliated  wholesale customers for
the second quarter and year-to-date 1996 increased 5.5% and 10.7%, respectively,
compared to the corresponding  periods of 1995 primarily due to increased demand
by municipalities and cooperatives in Georgia.  However,  capacity revenues from
sales to  non-affiliated  utilities  outside  the  service  territory  fell $2.7
million for the  quarter and $13.0  million  year-to-date  primarily  due to the
scheduled decline in megawatts of capacity under long-term contracts.

     Fuel  expense.  Fuel  expense  decreased  primarily  due to a  decrease  in
generation  resulting  from the  timing of  maintenance  at fossil  plants and a
slightly  lower  average  cost of fuel.  (See  Purchased  power from  affiliates
below.)

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power from  affiliates.  As a result of the timing of maintenance
at fossil plants  discussed  above,  purchased power from  affiliates  increased
compared to the same periods of 1995.  Purchased  power  transactions  among the
affiliated  companies within the Southern  electric system will vary from period
to  period  depending  on demand  and the  availability  and cost of  generating
resources at each company.  These  transactions do not have a significant impact
on earnings.

     Provision for separation benefits. The increase in provision for separation
benefits for each period is attributable to work force reduction programs, which
have been implemented to control growth in future operating  expenses.  See Note
(G) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for further details.

     Other operation expense.  Other operation expense increased for the quarter
and  year-to-date  1996  primarily  as a result of  increased  cost  under a new
three-year  retail rate plan  effective  January 1, 1996, and an adjustment to a
deferred  regulatory asset as a result of changes in GEORGIA's  retiree benefits
plan.

     Depreciation  and  amortization  expense.   Depreciation  and  amortization
increased in each period primarily due to accelerated depreciation of generating
plants pursuant to a new retail rate plan effective January 1, 1996, an increase
in plant-in-service and an increase in nuclear decommissioning expense.

     Other, net and Income taxes applicable to other income.  The primary reason
for the  decrease in these two items for the quarter and  year-to-date  1996 was
due to the  completion  of the sale, in June 1995, of Plant Scherer Unit 4 which
resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $12 million.

     Interest on  long-term  debt.  The decline in  interest on  long-term  debt
reflects the redemption and refinancing of long-term debt.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional  information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Competition"  and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in
the Form 10-K.

     Effective  January 1, 1996,  GEORGIA  began  operating  under a  three-year
retail rate plan. Under the plan, GEORGIA's earnings will be evaluated against a
retail  return on common  equity  range of 10% to 12.5%.  GEORGIA is required to
absorb cost increases of approximately  $29.0 million annually during the plan's
three-year   operation,   including   $14.0  million   annually  of  accelerated
depreciation of electric  plant.  Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for additional information.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset.  For additional  information about the Clean Air Act and
other  environmental  issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Reference is made to Notes (B),  (C), (F) and (J) through (P) in the "Notes
to  the  Condensed  Financial  Statements"  herein  for  discussion  of  various
contingencies  and other  matters which may affect  future  earnings  potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first six months of
1996 was the addition of  approximately  $242.5 million to utility plant.  These
additions were primarily related to transmission and distribution facilities and
to the purchase of nuclear fuel. The funds for these additions and other capital
requirements  were derived  primarily from operations.  See GEORGIA's  Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first quarter of 1996,  $150.0  million of GEORGIA's  first  mortgage
bonds matured,  and GEORGIA sold $10.0 million of medium-term notes and redeemed
$6.8  million of  industrial  development  bonds.  In June 1996,  GEORGIA  sold,
through a public  authority,  $51.3 million of variable rate  pollution  control
revenue bonds due 2023,  and the proceeds were applied to the redemption on July
1, 1996 of $51.3 million outstanding principal amount of 7.25% pollution control
revenue bonds.

     On August 2, 1996,  GEORGIA redeemed in full all $75.0 million  outstanding
shares of its $7.80  preferred  stock at the  redemption  price of  $101.82  per
share,  plus  accrued  dividends.  GEORGIA  plans  to  continue,  to the  extent
possible,  a program to retire  higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace
these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital  Requirements"  and  "Environmental  Issues" in the
Form  10-K  for  a  description  of  GEORGIA's  capital   requirements  for  its
construction program and environmental  compliance efforts.  Approximately $59.7
million will be required by June 30, 1997, in connection  with  redemptions  and
maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing  activities  previously  described herein,  GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds  required for  construction  and other  purposes  from
sources  similar to those used in the past.  The amount,  type and timing of any
financings--if  needed--will  depend  upon  maintenance  of  adequate  earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
GEORGIA  expects to have adequate  earnings  coverage ratios for any anticipated
security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet  short-term cash needs and  contingencies,  GEORGIA had at June 30,
1996, approximately $16.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$792.2  million  of unused  credit  arrangements  with banks  (including  $527.2
million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made only to fund

purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds). At June
30, 1996,  GEORGIA had outstanding $217.2 million of short-term notes payable to
banks and  $223.9  million  of  commercial  paper.  Since  GEORGIA  has no major
generating  plants under  construction,  management  believes  that the need for
working  capital can be  adequately  met by  utilizing  lines of credit  without
maintaining large cash balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying  condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia  corporation) as of June 30, 1996, and the related  condensed
statements of income for the  three-month  and six-month  periods ended June 30,
1996 and 1995,  and the  condensed  statements  of cash flows for the  six-month
periods  ended  June 30,  1996 and  1995.  These  financial  statements  are the
responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance  with  standards  established  by the
American  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants.  A  review  of  interim
financial  information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial  data and making  inquiries of persons  responsible  for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the  expression  of an opinion  regarding the  financial  statements  taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review,  we are not aware of any material  modifications  that
should be made to the financial  statements  referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously  audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards,  the balance  sheet of GEORGIA  POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1995
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 21, 1996, we expressed
an unqualified  opinion on that statement.  In our opinion,  the information set
forth in the  accompanying  condensed  balance sheet as of December 31, 1995, is
fairly stated, in all material  respects,  in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after  dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter and
year-to-date 1996 was $12.6 million and $23.8 million, respectively, compared to
$14.1 million and $25.0 million for the corresponding  periods of 1995. Earnings
decreased  by 10.7% for the  quarter  and by 4.6%  year-to-date  primarily  as a
result of increases in operating expenses.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the

</TABLE>

     Revenues.  Of the $20.9  million  increase in revenues  year-to-date  1996,
approximately $8.8 million impacted earnings.  Territorial  revenues,  excluding
those  revenues  which  represent the  pass-through  of fuel expense and certain
other expenses and do not affect income, increased $7.6 million. The increase in
retail revenues for the current year-to-date period was influenced significantly
by a 5.1% increase in total retail  kilowatt-hour  sales over the same period of
1995.  The change in retail energy sales is primarily due to higher  residential
and commercial sales as a result of colder-than-normal winter weather during the
first quarter of 1996 and a slight  increase in the number of customers  served.
Industrial  sales and revenues were down for the quarter and  year-to-date  1996
compared to the previous  periods  primarily  because of increased  sales in the
second quarter of 1995 to a large industrial customer who experienced mechanical
failures at its cogeneration facilities. The reduction in industrial revenues in
each  period  can  also  be  attributed  to  increased   participation   in  the
Real-Time-Pricing  program. See Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future  Earnings  Potential"  of GULF  in the  Form  10-K  for  information  on
initiatives  to remain  competitive  and to meet  conservation  goals set by the
Florida PSC.

     Fuel expense.  The reduction in fuel expense is primarily  attributable  to
decreased generation due to the scheduled maintenance outages at Plant Crist and
Plant Daniel during the first half of 1996. (See Purchased power from affiliates
below.)

     Purchased power from  affiliates.  As a result of the  maintenance  outages
mentioned above,  purchased power from affiliates increased compared to the same
periods of 1995.  Purchased power transactions among the affiliated companies

within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on
demand and the  availability  and cost of generating  resources at each company.
These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operation  expense.  Other operation expense increased for the second
quarter 1996  primarily due to increases in various  administrative  and general
expenses,  including  expenses related to the approved increase of GULF's annual
accrual to the accumulated  provision for property  damage to amortize  deferred
storm  charges  and  restore  the account  balance to a  reasonable  level.  For
additional  information  regarding the provision for property damage, see Item 7
MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future  Earnings  Potential" of GULF in
the Form  10-K.  Costs  associated  with  work  force  reduction  programs  also
contributed  to  the  increase  in  other  operation  expense.   For  additional
information  regarding  work  force  reduction  programs,  see  Note  (G) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein.

     Maintenance  expense.  The  increase in  maintenance  expense is  primarily
attributable  to the scheduled  maintenance  of  production  facilities at Plant
Crist and Plant Daniel during the first half of 1996.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition.  In
September  1995,  GULF filed with the Florida PSC a petition for approval of its
proposed  Commercial/Industrial  Service Rider (CISR), which would be applicable
to the rate schedules serving GULF's largest and most at-risk customers. On June
11,  1996,  the Florida  PSC denied  GULF's  petition.  GULF plans to modify its
request for approval of the CISR after further  discussions with the Florida PSC
staff.  For  additional  information,  see Item 7  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND
ANALYSIS  -  "Future  Earnings  Potential"  of  GULF  and  Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -
"Competition" in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's environmental cost recovery clause.
For  additional  information  about the  Clean  Air Act and other  environmental
issues,  see Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS -  "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     Reference  is made to  Notes  (B) and (F) in the  "Notes  to the  Condensed
Financial  Statements" herein for discussion of various  contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GULF's financial condition during the first half of 1996 was
the addition of  approximately  $38.2  million to utility  plant.  The funds for
these  additions  and other capital  requirements  were derived  primarily  from
operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Financing Activities

During the first  quarter of 1996,  GULF sold  $30.0  million of first  mortgage
bonds;  sold,  through a public  authority,  $21.2 million of pollution  control
revenue  refunding  bonds;  issued a $22.1  million bank note;  and retired $1.8
million  of  first  mortgage  bonds.  Under  the  terms of  GULF's  supplemental
indenture  dated as of January 1, 1996,  retained  earnings of $127 million were
restricted  against the payment of cash  dividends  on common  stock at June 30,
1996.

     In April 1996, GULF sold,  through a public  authority,  $12.075 million of
5.25%  pollution  control  revenue  refunding  bonds due 2006. The proceeds were
applied to the redemption in May 1996 of $12.075 million  outstanding  principal
amount of 6% pollution  control revenue bonds.  During the second quarter,  GULF
also redeemed $21.2 million  outstanding  principal  amount of 7.125%  pollution
control  revenue  refunding  bonds and  retired a $25.0  million  bank note that
matured in June 1996. GULF plans to continue,  to the extent possible, a program
to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital  Requirements  for  Construction,"  "Environmental  Matters" and "Other
Capital  Requirements"  in the Form 10-K for a  description  of  GULF's  capital
requirements for its construction program,  environmental compliance efforts and
maturing  debt.  Approximately  $15.5 million will be required by June 30, 1997,
for maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities  previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds  required for  construction  and other purposes from sources
similar  to  those  used  in the  past.  The  amount,  type  and  timing  of any
financings--if  needed--will  depend  upon  maintenance  of  adequate  earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
GULF  expects to have  adequate  earnings  coverage  ratios for any  anticipated
security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at June 30, 1996,
approximately  $0.8 million of cash and cash  equivalents  and $56.8  million of
unused committed lines of credit with banks  (including $20.3 million  liquidity
support for variable rate pollution  control bonds).  At June 30, 1996, GULF had
outstanding  $64.5 million of short-term notes payable to banks.  Since GULF has
no major generating plants under construction, management believes that the need
for working  capital can be adequately met by utilizing  lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's  net income  after  dividends  on  preferred  stock for the second
quarter and year-to-date 1996 was $11.4 million and $23.1 million, respectively,
compared to $14.7  million and $24.0  million for the  corresponding  periods of
1995. The 22.6%  decrease in earnings for the current  quarter was primarily due
to an increase in  operating  expenses.  To a lesser  extent,  such  increase in
operating expenses also affected  year-to-date earnings as evidenced by the 3.8%
decrease as compared to prior year.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the
following:

</TABLE>

     Revenues.  For the  year-to-date  period,  the increase in revenues was due
primarily to a 6.3%  increase in the amount of retail  energy sold over the same
period of 1995.  Retail  revenues,  excluding those revenues which represent the
recovery of fuel expense and certain  other  expenses and do not affect  income,
increased $7.2 million. Colder-than-normal weather during the first three months
of 1996,  warmer-than-usual  weather  during May,  and a slight  increase in the
number of customers  served had a positive  effect on 1996  year-to-date  retail
sales. Sales to territorial wholesale customers were also positively impacted by
weather  and  customer  growth.  Year-to-date  1996  revenues  from  territorial
wholesale  customers,  excluding  fuel  revenues  which  do not  affect  income,
increased $10.9 million compared to the same period of 1995, with an increase in
energy sales of 13.0%.

     Fuel  expense.  The  increase in fuel  expense  for the second  quarter and
year-to-date  1996 as  compared  to the  corresponding  periods  of 1995  can be
attributed  to higher  generation  necessary  to meet the  increased  demand for
electricity.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates.  The increase in expense for this item
results  primarily  from the  purchase,  beginning in June 1996, of capacity and
energy  from  another  utility  as  discussed   later  under  "Future   Earnings
Potential."

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power from  affiliates.  Purchased power  transactions  among the
affiliated  companies within the Southern  electric system will vary from period
to  period  depending  on demand  and the  availability  and cost of  generating
resources at each company.  These  transactions do not have a significant impact
on earnings.

     Maintenance  expense.  The increase in maintenance  expense for the current
quarter is primarily  attributable to maintenance  performed at Plant Watson and
other  projects  during the  second  quarter of 1996.  These same  factors  also
contributed to the increase in maintenance expense year-to-date 1996 in addition
to the  maintenance  performed at Plant Daniel in the first  quarter of 1996. In
1995,  maintenance  normally  performed  during the first  quarter was postponed
until the fourth quarter.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. Additional plant investment,  higher
depreciation  rates beginning in 1996, and increased  amortization of regulatory
assets,  primarily  those  assets  related  to the ECO plan,  accounted  for the
increases in this item.

     Taxes other than income taxes.  Taxes other than income taxes  increased in
each period due to higher retail  revenues  which  resulted in higher  municipal
franchise fees.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.  Operating  revenues will be affected by any changes in rates under
the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing  force on electric
rates,  with only moderate changes in rates taking place.  MISSISSIPPI has filed
with the  Mississippi  PSC the  semi-annual  PEP evaluation for the period ended
June 30, 1996. This filing  indicated a retail revenue  increase of $6.2 million
which is  1.46%  of  annual  retail  revenue.  Mississippi  PSC  action  on this
evaluation is expected later in 1996. MISSISSIPPI's 1996 annual filing under the
ECO plan  with the  Mississippi  PSC  resulted  in an  approved  annual  revenue
requirement decrease of $3.0 million, effective April 1996.

     MISSISSIPPI  has entered into  agreements to purchase  summer peaking power
and  options  for  power for the  years  1996  through  2000.  For June  through
September  of  1996,  MISSISSIPPI  has  entered  into  an  agreement  to buy 242
megawatts of capacity and energy from another electric utility. For June through
September of 1997 through 2000,  MISSISSIPPI  has purchased from power marketers
options for up to 250 megawatts of peaking power in 1997; 300 megawatts in 1998;
350 megawatts in 1999; and 400 megawatts in 2000. In June 1996, the  Mississippi
PSC  approved  MISSISSIPPI's  request that it be allowed to earn a return on the
capacity portion of these agreements.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional  information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Competition"  and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S   DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  -  "Future   Earnings   Potential"  of
MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered.  For additional  information  about the Clean Air Act
and  other  environmental  issues,  see  Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Reference  is made to  Notes  (B) and (F) in the  "Notes  to the  Condensed
Financial  Statements" herein for discussion of various  contingencies and other
matters which may affect future  earnings  potential.  Reference is also made to
Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in MISSISSIPPI's  financial  condition during the first half of
1996 was the addition of approximately $28.8 million to utility plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital  requirements  were derived primarily from
operations  and an increase in  short-term  debt.  See  MISSISSIPPI's  Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first quarter of 1996, maturities of long-term notes to banks totaled
$20.0 million.  In April 1996,  MISSISSIPPI issued a $30.0 million variable rate
bank note due 1999, and in May, MISSISSIPPI redeemed $45.4 million of its 9 1/4%
first  mortgage  bonds due 2021.  MISSISSIPPI  plans to continue,  to the extent
possible,  a program to retire  higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace
these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference  is  made  to  Item  7  -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  of
MISSISSIPPI  under  "Capital  Requirements  for  Construction,"   "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital  Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of
MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its construction  program,  environmental
compliance efforts,  sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt.
Through  June  30,  1997,  approximately  $35.0  million  will be  required  for
maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds  required for  construction  and other  purposes  from
sources  similar to those used in the past.  The amount,  type and timing of any
financings--if  needed--will  depend  upon  maintenance  of  adequate  earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
MISSISSIPPI   expects  to  have  adequate   earnings  coverage  ratios  for  any
anticipated  security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS -
"Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet  short-term cash needs and  contingencies,  MISSISSIPPI had at June
30,  1996,   approximately  $1.6  million  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and
approximately  $96.0 million of unused committed credit  arrangements with banks
(including $10.8 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made
only to fund purchase  obligations  relating to variable rate pollution  control
bonds).  At  June  30,  1996,  MISSISSIPPI  had  outstanding  $55.0  million  of
short-term  notes payable to banks.  Since  MISSISSIPPI has no major  generating
plants under construction, management believes that the need for working capital
can be adequately  met by utilizing  lines of credit without  maintaining  large
cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income after  dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
and year-to-date 1996 was $5.9 million and $8.6 million, respectively,  compared
to $6.0 million and $8.5 million for the corresponding  periods of 1995. For the
quarter,  earnings  decreased by 3.0%  primarily due to an increase in operating
expenses while earnings for the year-to-date  period remained fairly constant as
evidenced by a 1.6% increase.

     Significant  income statement items appropriate for discussion  include the

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses  and do not affect  income,  revenues for the quarter  remained  fairly
constant while revenues  year-to-date  1996  increased  approximately  $392,000,
compared to the  corresponding  periods of 1995.  The  increase in  year-to-date
revenues was due  primarily to an increase in the amount of retail  energy sold.
Year-to-date 1996 total retail  kilowatt-hour sales increased 3.9% over the same
period  of  1995,  and  retail  revenues,  excluding  fuel  revenues,  increased
approximately  $867,000.  A slight  increase in the number of  customers  served
accounted  for  most of the  increase  in  residential  and  commercial  demand;
however, kilowatt-hour sales to the industrial sector were down primarily due to
a reduction in the  production  schedule of one of SAVANNAH's  major  industrial
customers.

     Fuel  expense.  The  increase  in fuel  expense  for  year-to-date  1996 as
compared  to the same  period of 1995 can be  attributed  to  higher  generation
necessary to meet the increased demand for electricity and to an increase in the
average cost of fuel.

     Purchased power from  affiliates.  Purchased power  transactions  among the
affiliated  companies within the Southern  electric system will vary from period
to  period  depending  on demand  and the  availability  and cost of  generating
resources at each company.  These  transactions do not have a significant impact
on earnings.

     Maintenance  expense.  Maintenance  expense  decreased  in the  quarter and
year-to-date  1996 as  compared  to previous  periods  primarily  as a result of
higher-than-normal maintenance performed in 1995 at Plants Kraft and McIntosh.

                       SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of  operations  discussed  above are not  necessarily  indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional  information,  see Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Competition"  and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings  Potential" of SAVANNAH
in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset.  For additional  information about the Clean Air Act and
other  environmental  issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (Q) and (R) in the "Notes to the  Condensed
Financial  Statements" herein for discussion of various  contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first half of 1996
was the addition of approximately  $15.2 million to utility plant. The funds for
these  additions  and other capital  requirements  were derived  primarily  from
internal sources and external financing.  See SAVANNAH's Condensed Statements of
Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first three  months of 1996,  SAVANNAH  retired $1.2 million of its 9
3/8% first  mortgage  bonds to meet sinking fund  requirements  and entered into
arrangements  with the Savannah Economic  Development  Authority to provide $7.0
million for the financing of a new coal handling facility at Plant Kraft.

     In May, 1996,  SAVANNAH  issued $20.0 million of 6.90% first mortgage bonds
due 2006 and a $10.0 million 6.88% bank note due 2001. The proceeds were used to
redeem on July 1, 1996 all remaining outstanding 9 3/8% first mortgage bonds due
2021.  SAVANNAH plans to continue,  to the extent possible,  a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of SAVANNAH
under  "Capital  Requirements  for  Construction,"  "Environmental  Matters" and
"Other  Capital  Requirements"  in the Form 10-K for a description of SAVANNAH's
capital  requirements for its  construction  program,  environmental  compliance
efforts, sinking fund requirements and long-term debt maturities.  Approximately
$28.8  million will be required by June 30, 1997,  for  maturities  of long-term

                       SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for  construction and other purposes
from sources  similar to those used in the past. The amount,  type and timing of
any  financings--if  needed--will  depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
SAVANNAH expects to have adequate  earnings  coverage ratios for any anticipated
security  sales  through  at least  1998.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -  "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and  contingencies,  SAVANNAH had at June 30,
1996, approximately $23.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$40.5  million of unused  credit  arrangements  with  banks.  At June 30,  1996,
SAVANNAH  had no  short-term  debt  outstanding.  Since  SAVANNAH  has no  major
generating  plants under  construction,  management  believes  that the need for
working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)  The condensed financial  statements of the registrants included herein have
     been prepared by each registrant,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and
     regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of each registrant's management, the
     information   regarding  such  registrant  furnished  herein  reflects  all
     adjustments (which included only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to
     present  fairly the results  for the periods  ended June 30, 1996 and 1995.
     Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
     statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
     principles  have been  condensed  or  omitted  pursuant  to such  rules and
     regulations,   although  each  registrant  believes  that  the  disclosures
     regarding such  registrant are adequate to make the  information  presented
     not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed financial  statements
     be read in conjunction with the financial  statements and the notes thereto
     included in each  registrant's  latest annual report on Form 10-K.  Certain
     prior-period  amounts have been reclassified to conform with current-period
     presentation.

          The condensed  financial  statements  of ALABAMA and GEORGIA  included
     herein have been  reviewed by ALABAMA's and  GEORGIA's  independent  public
     accountants as set forth in their reports  included  herein as Exhibit 1 to
     ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)  SOUTHERN's  operating  affiliates  are  subject to the  provisions  of FASB
     Statement  No.  71,   Accounting  for  the  Effects  of  Certain  Types  of
     Regulation.  In the event that a portion of a  company's  operations  is no
     longer subject to these provisions,  the company would be required to write
     off related  regulatory assets and liabilities,  and determine if any other
     assets have been impaired.  For additional  information,  see Note 1 to the
     financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(C)  The  staff of the SEC has  questioned  certain  of the  current  accounting
     practices of the electric utility industry--including SOUTHERN's--regarding
     the recognition,  measurement and classification of  decommissioning  costs
     for nuclear generating facilities in the financial statements.  In response
     to these  questions,  the FASB has  decided  to review the  accounting  for
     liabilities related to closure and removal of long-lived assets,  including
     nuclear  decommissioning.  Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
     ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN,  ALABAMA and GEORGIA in
     Item 7 and Note 1 to the  financial  statements  of  SOUTHERN,  ALABAMA and
     GEORGIA under  "Depreciation and Nuclear  Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the
     Form 10-K.

(D)  The SOUTHERN system utilizes certain financial  derivative contracts solely
     for the  purpose  of  risk  management.  The  companies'  participation  in
     derivative contracts has been to hedge business exposure in connection with
     SEI  activities  to  fluctuations  in interest  rates and foreign  currency
     exchange  rates.  At June 30, 1996,  the status of  outstanding  derivative
     contracts was as follows:

                                    Maturity or     Notional       Unrealized
                 Type               Termination      Amount        Gain (Loss)
                 ----               -----------     --------       -----------
                                                         (in thousands)
     Interest rate swaps          1999-2011          $839,465         $(4,925)
     Foreign currency forwards    Renewed monthly      13,178             (70)
     Cross-currency swaps         2002                164,586          (1,500)

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(E)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item
     8 of the Form  10-K  for a  description  of the  proceedings  related  to a
     derivative  action filed against certain  current and former  directors and
     officers of SOUTHERN. In May 1996, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
     the 11th Circuit  affirmed the trial  court's  dismissal of this suit.  The
     plaintiffs'  subsequent  request for rehearing by the full appellate  court
     was denied in August 1996.

(F)  Reference is made to Note 3 to each of the registrant's, except SAVANNAH's,
     financial  statements  in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a  discussion  of the
     proceedings  initiated  by the FERC  regarding  the  reasonableness  of the
     return on common  equity  on  certain  of the  Southern  electric  system's
     wholesale rate schedules and contracts.

(G)  Certain of the registrants and other SOUTHERN  subsidiaries have instituted
     work force reduction programs.  The expenses recognized and the unamortized
     balance of deferred  expenses  under these  programs  were as follows:  (in
     thousands)

(H)  In June  1995,  the  Alabama  PSC issued a rate  order  granting  ALABAMA's
     request  for  gradual  adjustments  to move toward  parity  among  customer
     classes. This order also calls for a moratorium on any periodic retail rate
     increases  (but not  decreases)  until July 2001.  In  December  1995,  the
     Alabama PSC issued an order  authorizing  ALABAMA to reduce  balance  sheet
     items--such as plant and deferred  charges--at  any time  ALABAMA's  actual
     base rate revenues exceed the budgeted revenues.  Reference is made to Note
     3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form
     10-K for additional information.

(I)  In January 1996,  Alabama Power  Capital  Trust I (the  "Trust"),  of which
     ALABAMA  owns all the  common  securities,  issued  $97  million  of 7.375%
     mandatorily  redeemable  preferred  securities.  Substantially  all  of the
     assets  of the  Trust  are  $100  million  aggregate  principal  amount  of
     ALABAMA's  7.375%  Junior  Subordinated  Notes due March 31, 2026.  ALABAMA
     considers  that the mechanisms  and  obligations  relating to the preferred
     securities,  taken together,  constitute a full and unconditional guarantee
     by ALABAMA of the Trust's payment obligations with respect to the preferred
     securities.

(J)  On February  16, 1996,  the Georgia PSC  approved a three-year  retail rate
     plan for GEORGIA  effective  January 1, 1996. For  additional  information,
     reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(K)  Pursuant to orders from the Georgia PSC,  GEORGIA  deferred  financing  and
     depreciation  costs under  phase-in  plans for Plant  Vogtle  Units 1 and 2
     until the allowed  investment  was fully  reflected  in rates as of October
     1991. In addition,  the Georgia PSC issued two separate  accounting  orders
     that required  GEORGIA to defer  substantially  all operating and financing
     costs related to both units until rate orders  addressed  these costs.  The
     Georgia PSC orders  provide for recovery of deferred costs within 10 years.
     The Georgia PSC also ordered GEORGIA to levelize declining capacity buyback
     expense from the  co-owners of the plant over a six-year  period  beginning
     October 1991. The  unamortized  balance of these deferred costs at June 30,
     1996,  was  $240.6  million.  See  Note 1 to the  financial  statements  of
     SOUTHERN and Note 3 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item 8 of the
     Form 10-K for additional information.

(L)  Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information  concerning the recovery
     by GEORGIA of its costs  associated  with the Rocky Mountain pumped storage
     hydroelectric plant.

(M)  Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for  information  regarding  recovery by
     GEORGIA  of  its  costs  associated  with  its   discontinued   demand-side
     conservation programs.

(N)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial  statements of GEORGIA in Item
     8 of the Form 10-K for information  concerning a joint complaint filed with
     the FERC by OPC and MEAG seeking  recovery of alleged partial  requirements
     rates  overcharges and the order of the FERC dismissing such complaint.  In
     June 1996, the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  Circuit
     vacated the FERC's  order  insofar as it denied  OPC's claim for a share of
     the settlement  proceeds that GEORGIA  received from Gulf States  Utilities
     Company and remanded the case to the FERC.

(O)  In May 1996, MEAG filed a complaint with the FERC seeking termination as of
     December  31, 1996 of the  partial  requirements  tariff  pursuant to which
     GEORGIA  currently sells wholesale energy to MEAG. The complaint also seeks
     refunds  in an  unspecified  amount as a result of alleged  overcharges  by
     GEORGIA  under the tariff for the years 1993,  1994,  1995 and 1996. In its
     response,  filed with the FERC in June 1996, GEORGIA also requests that its
     partial  requirements  service  obligation  to MEAG be terminated as of the
     date  sought by MEAG.  GEORGIA  further  denies  that any refund is owed to
     MEAG.

(P)  Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA  in Item 8 of the Form  10-K for  information  regarding  GEORGIA's
     designation  as a  potentially  responsible  party under the  Comprehensive
     Environmental   Response,   Compensation   and   Liability  Act  and  other
     environmental contingencies.

(Q)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SAVANNAH in Item
     8 of the  Form  10-K  for  information  regarding  SAVANNAH's  discontinued
     demand-side conservation programs.

(R)  SAVANNAH is currently undergoing an earnings review by the Georgia PSC, and
     to date, the Georgia PSC has made no determination.

(S)  Actions  against  ALABAMA  have been filed in several  counties  in Alabama
     charging  ALABAMA with fraud and  non-compliance  with regulatory  statutes
     relating to the offer, sale and financing of "extended  service  contracts"
     in connection with the sale of electric appliances. Some of these cases are

     filed as class  actions,  while  others  were  filed on behalf of  multiple
     individual  plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs in these actions seek damages in an
     unspecified amount.  ALABAMA has offered extended service agreements to its
     customers since January 1984, and  approximately  175,000  extended service
     agreements  could be involved in these  proceedings.  The final  outcome of
     these cases cannot now be determined.

                        Financial  Statements  herein for information  regarding
                        certain legal and  administrative  proceedings  in which

                        seeks to enjoin the TVA from  violating  a 1959 act that
                        prohibits  the TVA from selling  power  outside the area
                        that was being served by it in 1957.

Item 4.          Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

                 SOUTHERN

                 SOUTHERN  held its annual  meeting of  stockholders  on May 22,
                 1996.  Each  nominee  for  director of  SOUTHERN  received  the
