                 THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
              MANAGEMENT'S OPINION AS TO FAIR STATEMENT OF RESULTS

    The condensed financial statements of SOUTHERN included herein have been
prepared by SOUTHERN, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the SEC.  In the opinion of SOUTHERN's management, subject to the effect of
such adjustments, if any, as might have been required had the outcome of the
uncertainty with respect to the actions of the regulators regarding the
recoverability of GEORGIA's investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped storage
hydroelectric project as more fully discussed in Note (G) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein, been known, the information furnished herein
reflects all adjustments (which, except for the provision for separation
benefits recorded in the first quarter of 1994, included only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results for the periods ended
March 31, 1994 and 1993.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations, although SOUTHERN believes that the disclosures are adequate to
make the information presented not misleading.  It is suggested that these
condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and the notes thereto included in SOUTHERN's latest annual report on
Form 10-K.

                 THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS
SOUTHERN's earnings for the first three months of 1994 were lower than earnings
recorded in the same period of 1993 primarily because of costs associated with
workforce reduction programs for GEORGIA and the system service company, SCS.
Consolidated net income was $142 million for the first quarter of 1994,
compared to $177 million for the first quarter of 1993.  Earnings per share
were $0.22 in the first quarter of 1994, compared to $0.28 in the corresponding
period of 1993.  However, disregarding the after-tax effect of the workforce
reduction programs of $57 million ($0.09 per share), earnings would have risen
approximately $22 million.  The improvement in operating results was primarily
the result of higher retail revenues and lower capital costs.

REVENUES
Retail energy sales increased 4.9% primarily because of weather, abetted by
improvement in the economy.  Energy sales to residential, commercial and
industrial customers increased 6.8%, 6.7% and 2.5%, respectively.  Wholesale
energy sales decreased due to reduced demand and scheduled reductions in
off-system contracts.  Capacity revenues for the first quarter of 1994 were $21
million less than in the first quarter of 1993 primarily because GEORGIA
completed the second sale of a portion of Plant Scherer Unit 4 in June 1993.
The third sale in a series of four transactions for the sale of this generating
unit is scheduled for June 1994.  The generation from this unit has been
dedicated to unit power sales.

EXPENSES
Fuel expense for the first three months of 1994, compared to the corresponding
period of 1993, increased due primarily to a 3.8% increase in fossil fuel
generation.  The increase in fossil generation was necessitated by increased
demand and reduced hydro generation.  Purchased power expense decreased because
of the reduction in capacity buyback payments by GEORGIA to the co-owners of
plants Vogtle and Scherer.  See Note (F) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for information regarding the Georgia PSC's retail rate order that
required the levelization of capacity buyback expense for Plant Vogtle.

    The workforce reduction programs initiated by GEORGIA and SCS and an
earlier one for SAVANNAH are projected to yield pre-tax savings, disregarding
the one-time cost of these programs, of approximately $16 million in 1994 and
approximately $30 million in each of the succeeding four years.  Maintenance
expenses increased due to the timing of scheduled maintenance on generating
units.  The increase in depreciation and amortization is attributable to
increased investment in plant.

    The decrease in income tax expense was not proportionate to the change in
net income because of the federal income tax rate increase enacted in August
1993.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

INTEREST CHARGES AND DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED STOCK
The decrease in interest on long-term debt and dividends on preferred stock
reflects the SOUTHERN system's efforts to decrease its capital costs.  In
response to the low interest rate levels prevailing during 1992 and 1993, the
SOUTHERN system refinanced a significant portion of its long-term debt and
preferred stock.  To the extent it is economically feasible, efforts to reduce
capital costs will continue.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction and not included in rate base.  The equity portion represents
non-cash income.  However, when facilities are completed and included in rate
base, previously capitalized amounts significantly increase cash flow because
revenues are higher as a result of the increased rate base and additional
depreciation expense.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings is contingent upon
numerous factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.

    Reference is made to the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for further discussion of various uncertainties and legal proceedings related
to: the actions of regulators regarding the recovery of GEORGIA's investment
in the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project; a civil suit filed
against ALABAMA related to financing agreements; a suit filed against GULF
related to fuel transportation; and the outcome of a proceeding initiated by
the FERC to determine the appropriate return on equity on wholesale power and
transmission contracts.

    Pursuant to an Integrated Resource Plan approved by the Georgia PSC,
GEORGIA has implemented various demand-side option programs and had been
authorized by the Georgia PSC to recover associated program costs through rate
riders.  In October 1993, a superior court judge ruled that recovery of these
costs through rate riders was  unlawful.  GEORGIA has appealed this ruling and
ceased collection of the rate riders.  The Georgia PSC has allowed the deferral
of program costs pending the final outcome of this matter.  For additional
information on this matter, see Note (H) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein.

    Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
increased costs cannot be offset.  The Clean Air Act is discussed under
"Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
SOUTHERN's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

    Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, and the rate of economic growth in SOUTHERN's service area.  The
enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the electric utility
industry.  A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy Act and
particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SOUTHERN's 1993
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition,
measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating
stations in financial statements.  In response to these questions the electric
utility industry has requested the Financial Accounting Standards Board to
review the accounting for removal costs, including decommissioning.  If current
electric utility industry accounting practices for such decommissioning costs
are changed: (1) annual provisions for decommissioning could increase and (2)
the total estimated cost for decommissioning may be required to be recorded as
a liability on the balance sheet.  ALABAMA and GEORGIA do not believe that such
changes, if required, would have a significant adverse effect on results of
operations due to their current and expected future ability to recover
decommissioning costs through rates.  Further discussion of nuclear
decommissioning costs is made in Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first three
months of 1994 were the addition of approximately $319 million to utility plant
and the sale of SOUTHERN's common stock for $122 million.  The funds for gross
property additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations, an increase in short-term indebtedness and security sales.  See
SOUTHERN's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.
Additionally, SOUTHERN's board of directors declared a two-for-one common
stock split in the form of a stock distribution for each share issued and
outstanding as of February 7, 1994.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE
One of SOUTHERN's goals is to maintain common equity as a percent of total
capitalization, including short-term debt and the current portion of
capitalization, within a range of 40 to 45%.  This ratio was 44.1% at March 31,
1994, compared to 43.8% at December 31, 1993.  The market price of SOUTHERN's
common stock at March 31, 1994, was $19 per share, compared to a book value of
$11.96.  This represents a market-to-book value ratio of 159%.  The quarterly
dividend for the first quarter of 1994 was 29.5 cents per share.

                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION  (Continued)

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION
The construction program of the Southern electric system is budgeted at $4.3
billion for the three years 1994 through 1996 ($1.5 billion in 1994, $1.3
billion in 1995 and $1.5 billion in 1996). Actual construction costs may vary
from this estimate because of such factors as changes in business conditions;
changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulations; changes in environmental
regulations; revised load growth projections; increasing costs of labor,
equipment and materials; and the cost of capital.

    Current energy demand forecasts do not require any additional baseload
generating facilities until well into the future.  However, the construction of
combustion turbine peaking units of approximately 1,700 megawatts is planned by
1996 to meet the increased peak-hour demands.  In addition, significant
construction will continue related to transmission and distribution facilities
and the upgrading and extension of the useful lives of generating plants.
GEORGIA and Oglethorpe Power Corporation have entered into a joint ownership
agreement for the latter to assume responsibility for the construction and
completion of the Rocky Mountain project.  This agreement is described further
in Note 4 to the financial statements in Item 8 of SOUTHERN's 1993 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

   Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the
Southern electric system's capital requirements and operating costs.  The acid
rain compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will have a significant impact
on the Southern electric system.  This legislation, as well as other
legislation and regulations, are described under "Environmental Matters" in
Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SOUTHERN's 1993 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.  The full impact of these requirements cannot be determined at
this time, pending the development and implementation of applicable
regulations.

OTHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
In addition to the funds needed for the construction program, approximately $97
million will be required by March 31, 1995, for present sinking fund
requirements and maturities of long-term debt and preferred stock.  Also, the
operating subsidiaries plan to continue, to the extent possible, a program to
retire high-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these obligations with
lower-cost capital.

SOURCES OF FUNDS
In addition to the sale of common stock in the first quarter of 1994, SOUTHERN
may require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year.  The
amounts and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 1994, as well
as in subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment
opportunities.  The operating subsidiaries plan to obtain the funds required
for construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the
past.  However, the type and timing of financings will depend on market
conditions, maintenance of adequate earnings, and

regulatory approval.  Additionally, GEORGIA expects to receive approximately
$260 million during 1994 and 1995 from the sale of its remaining ownership
interest in Plant Scherer Unit 4.  These property sales are discussed further
in Note 7 to the financial statements in Item 8 in SOUTHERN's 1993 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

    To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
March 31, 1994, approximately $213 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $1.1 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks.

    At March 31, 1994, the system companies had outstanding $666 million of
notes payable and $93 million of commercial paper.  The short-term lines of
credit may not be utilized in their entirety without additional regulatory
approval.  Since the construction program with respect to major generating
projects has been completed, management believes that the need for working
capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining
large cash balances.

    In order to issue additional long-term debt and preferred stock, the
operating subsidiaries must comply with certain earnings coverage requirements
outlined in their respective mortgage indentures and corporate charters.  The
coverage ratios of SOUTHERN's operating subsidiaries are sufficiently high to
permit, at present interest rate levels, any foreseeable security sales.  The
amount of securities which they will be permitted to issue in the future will
depend upon market conditions and other factors prevailing at that time.

                             ALABAMA POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ALABAMA's financial performance during the first quarter of 1994 improved,
compared to the same period of 1993, due primarily to higher retail revenues
and lower financing costs.  Net income after dividends on preferred stock was
$72.0 million during the first three months of 1994, compared to $57.9 million
in the corresponding period of 1993.

REVENUES
Operating revenues in the first three months of 1994 increased over the
corresponding period of 1993 due to higher energy sales to retail customers.
The rise in retail energy sales of 5.0% is attributable primarily to an
increase in customers served, weather and the improving economy in Alabama.
Revenues from non-affiliated wholesale customers also increased, including an
$11.5 million increase in capacity revenues.  Total energy sales increased
3.2%.

    Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company.  These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

EXPENSES
Fuel expense increased because of a 17.5% increase in coal-fired generation.
Coal-fired generation increased because of greater demand and lower hydro
generation.  Other operation expenses increased primarily due to a workforce
reduction program initiated by the system service company, SCS, for which
ALABAMA recorded $7.3 million as its share of such costs (includes allocation
of $1.9 million from Southern Nuclear Operating Company).  Maintenance expenses
for the first quarter of 1994 were higher than the same period of 1993 due
primarily to increased maintenance on fossil generating units and transmission
plant.  The decrease in depreciation and amortization reflects lower average
depreciation rates effective January 1994 primarily as a result of new
estimates of the expected lives of certain fossil generating units.

    The increase in income tax expense reflected the improvement in earnings
and an increase in the federal income tax rate enacted in August 1993.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
AFUDC represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are
necessary to finance the construction of new facilities.  While cash is not
realized currently from such allowance, it is realized over the service life of
the plant through increased revenues resulting from a higher rate base and
higher depreciation expense.  The amount of AFUDC recorded will rise as
ALABAMA's investment in the construction of combustion turbine peaking units
approach commercial operation.

INTEREST CHARGES AND DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED STOCK
The decrease in interest on long-term debt and dividends on preferred stock
reflects ALABAMA's

efforts to decrease its capital costs.  ALABAMA, in response to the low
interest rate levels prevailing during 1992 and 1993, refinanced a significant
portion of its long-term debt and preferred stock.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.

    Discussed in the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein are
certain regulatory and legal proceedings that may impact ALABAMA's future
earnings.  The issues include a civil suit related to financing agreements and
proceedings concerning the reasonableness of the Southern electric system's
wholesale rate schedules and contracts.

    Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
cost increases cannot be offset.  The Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues are discussed under "Environmental Issues" in Item 7 - Management's
Discussion and Analysis in ALABAMA's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    Future earnings will also depend upon growth in electric sales which are
subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors have included
changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced
by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather, competition, and the rate of
economic growth in ALABAMA's service area.  The enactment of the Energy Act
will have a profound effect on the future of the electric utility industry.  A
discussion of the potential impact of the Energy Act and particularly its
effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings Potential" in Item 
7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in ALABAMA's 1993 Annual Report on Form
10-K.

The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting practices
of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition, measurement and
classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating stations in
financial statements.  In response to these questions the electric utility
industry has requested the Financial Accounting Standards Board to review the
accounting for removal costs, including decommissioning.  If current electric
utility industry accounting practices for such decommissioning costs are
changed: (1) annual provisions for decommissioning could increase and (2) the
total estimated cost for decommissioning may be required to be recorded as a
liability on the balance sheet.  ALABAMA does not believe that such changes, if
required, would have a significant adverse effect on results of operations due
to its current and expected future ability to recover decommissioning costs
through rates.  Further discussion of nuclear decommissioning costs is made in
Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The principal change in ALABAMA's financial condition in the first three months
of 1994 was gross property additions of $100 million to utility plant.  The
funds for gross property additions were derived from operating activities and
an increase in short-term debt.  See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash
Flows herein for further details.

    During the first three months of 1994, ALABAMA refinanced $24.4 million of
pollution control bonds.  ALABAMA's common equity as a percent of total
capitalization was 47.6% at March 31, 1994, compared to 47.4% at year-end 1993.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
ALABAMA has regulatory approval for short-term borrowings of up to $450
million.  At March 1994, ALABAMA had outstanding $43 million of commercial
paper and $47 million of notes payable and had $469 million of committed lines
of credit available.

   Capital expenditures are estimated to total $1.7 billion for the three years
1994 through 1996 ($588 million in 1994, $572 million in 1995 and $531 million
in 1996).  Current energy demand forecasts do not require any additional
baseload generating facilities until well into the future.  However, the
construction of combustion turbine peaking units of approximately 720 megawatts
of capacity is planned by 1996 to meet increased peak-hour demands.  In
addition, significant construction of transmission and distribution facilities
and upgrading of generating plants will continue.

    The capital budget is subject to periodic review and revision and capital
costs incurred may vary from estimates because of several factors, including
changes in business conditions; revised load growth projections; changes in
environmental regulations; changes in existing nuclear plant to meet new
regulatory requirements; increasing costs of labor, equipment and materials;
and the cost of capital.

   In addition to the funds needed for the capital budget, approximately $47.4
million will be required by March 31, 1995, for debt maturities.  Also, ALABAMA
plans to continue a program to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and
replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

    It is anticipated that the funds required will be derived from sources
similar to those used in the past.  In order to issue additional first mortgage
bonds and preferred stock, ALABAMA must comply with certain earnings coverage
requirements contained in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter.
ALABAMA's coverages are at a level that would permit any necessary amount of
security sales at current interest and dividend rates.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS





TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

    We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of March 31, 1994, and the related condensed statements of income
for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended March 31, 1994 and 1993, and
condensed statements of cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31,
1994 and 1993.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.

    We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of
which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken
as a whole.  Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

    Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

   We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1993
(not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 16, 1994, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement.  In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                             GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
              MANAGEMENT'S OPINION AS TO FAIR STATEMENT OF RESULTS


  The condensed financial statements of GEORGIA included herein have been
prepared by GEORGIA, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the SEC.  As more fully discussed in Note (G) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein, an uncertainty exists with respect to the actions of the
regulators regarding the recoverability of GEORGIA's investment in the Rocky
Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project.  In the opinion of GEORGIA's
management, subject to the effect of such adjustments, if any, as might have
been required had the outcome of the uncertainty been known, the information
regarding GEORGIA furnished herein reflects all adjustments (which, except for
the provision for separation benefits recorded in the first quarter of 1994,
included only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the
results for the periods ended March 31, 1994 and 1993. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or
omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations, although GEORGIA believes that
the disclosures regarding GEORGIA are adequate to make the information
presented not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed financial
statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes
thereto included in GEORGIA's latest annual report on Form 10-K.

                    REVIEW BY INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

    The condensed financial statements of GEORGIA included herein have been
reviewed by GEORGIA's independent public accountants as set forth in their
report included herein as Exhibit 1.

                             GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS
GEORGIA's earnings for the first quarter of 1994 declined compared to the
corresponding quarter of 1993, primarily as a result of charges related to
workforce reduction programs at GEORGIA and the system service company, SCS.
Net income after dividends on preferred stock was $57.6 million in the first
quarter of 1994 and $108.4 million in the first quarter of 1993.  However,
disregarding the provision for separation benefits, GEORGIA's earnings would
have been slightly above earnings in the first quarter of 1993.

REVENUES
Total operating revenues decreased compared to the first quarter of 1993
because of the decrease in energy sales to non-affiliated wholesale customers.
Excluding fuel clause revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses and do not affect income, operating revenues for the first quarter of
1994 decreased $5.8 million, compared to the corresponding period of 1993.

    Retail - Retail energy sales increased 4.8% primarily because of an
increase in customers served and continued improvement in Georgia's economy.
Residential, commercial and industrial energy sales increased 4.1%, 6.5% and
3.9%, respectively.  Total non-fuel retail revenues increased $14.9 million.

    Wholesale - Energy sales to non-affiliated wholesale customers for the
first quarter of 1994 decreased 33.4%, compared to the corresponding period of
1993.  The energy component of contract sales is priced at approximately the
variable production cost and does not materially affect earnings.  Capacity
revenues from non-affiliated utilities outside the service area, which do
affect earnings, were down $30.3 million.  These capacity revenues decreased as
scheduled, due primarily to GEORGIA completing the second in a series of four
transactions for the sale of Plant Scherer Unit 4 in June 1993.  The third sale
of this unit is scheduled for June 1994.  The decline in capacity revenues
cited above was partially offset by increases in revenues from wholesale
customers within the service territory.

    Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company.  These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

OPERATING EXPENSES
Fuel and Purchased Power - Purchased power expense for the first quarter of
1994 decreased primarily due to scheduled reductions in capacity buyback
payments to the co-owners of plants Vogtle and Scherer.  See Note (F) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for information regarding the
levelization of capacity buyback expense for Plant Vogtle.  In addition,
GEORGIA purchased less energy from affiliated companies because of lower
wholesale energy demands.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

   Other - As part of the SOUTHERN system's effort to curtail growth in
operating expenses, both GEORGIA and SCS initiated workforce reduction programs
in the first quarter of 1994.  GEORGIA's portion of SCS's costs for such
programs amounted to approximately $12.1 million, while GEORGIA's programs
amounted to approximately $72.6 million.  Other operation expense increased
primarily due to the recognition of higher retiree medical and life insurance
costs as mandated by Financial Accounting Standard No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions."  The Georgia PSC
ordered that such costs be phased in over a five-year period as further
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements for GEORGIA in Item 8 of the
SOUTHERN system's combined 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction and is included in rate base.  The equity portion of AFUDC
represents non-cash income.  The amount of AFUDC recorded will rise as
GEORGIA's investment in the construction of combustion turbine peaking units
increases as the units approach their commercial operation in 1994 and 1995.
Based upon GEORGIA's construction budget, AFUDC is estimated to total $19
million in 1994 and $27 million in 1995.

INTEREST CHARGES AND DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED STOCK
Interest charges and preferred stock dividends have declined due to refinancing
efforts over the past twelve months.  Also, GEORGIA used the proceeds from the
Plant Scherer sale to redeem high cost securities.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings.  The level of future earnings is contingent upon numerous
factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.

    Pursuant to an Integrated Resource Plan approved by the Georgia PSC,
GEORGIA has implemented various demand-side option programs and had been
authorized by the Georgia PSC to recover associated program costs through rate
riders.  In October 1993, a superior court judge ruled that recovery of these
costs through rate riders is unlawful.  GEORGIA has appealed this ruling and
ceased collection of the rate riders.  The Georgia PSC has allowed the deferral
of program costs pending the final outcome of this matter.  For additional
information on this matter, see Note (H) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein.

    The addition of new peaking capacity in 1994 and 1995 will result in
increased related operation, maintenance and depreciation expense.  In
addition, the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project is scheduled
to commence commercial operation in 1995.  During 1994 and 1995 GEORGIA is
scheduled to sell its remaining ownership interest (33.1%) in Plant

Scherer Unit 4 to Florida Power & Light and the Jacksonville Electric
Authority.  These transactions will generate approximately $260 million in
cash, including an estimated after-tax gain of approximately $20 million.
These transactions coincide with scheduled reductions in capacity sales to
these utilities under unit power sales contracts.

    Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, and the rate of economic growth in GEORGIA's service area.  The
enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the future of the
electric utility industry.  A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy
Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in GEORGIA's 1993
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition,
measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating
stations in financial statements.  In response to these questions the electric
utility industry has requested the Financial Accounting Standards Board to
review the accounting for removal costs, including decommissioning.  If current
electric utility industry accounting practices for such decommissioning costs
are changed: (1) annual provisions for decommissioning could increase and (2)
the total estimated cost for decommissioning may be required to be recorded as
a liability on the balance sheet.  GEORGIA does not believe that such changes,
if required, would have a significant adverse effect on results of operations
due to its current and expected future ability to recover decommissioning costs
through rates.  Further discussion of nuclear decommissioning costs is made in
Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The principal changes in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first three
months of 1994 were additions of $143 million to utility plant and recognition
of the liability associated with the implementation of workforce reduction
programs.  The funds needed for gross property additions are currently provided
from operations.  See GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.  Moody's Investors Service, Inc. recently upgraded GEORGIA's credit
ratings.

CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
Estimated construction expenditures for the years 1994 through 1996 are $688
million, $555 million and $629 million, respectively.  These estimated
expenditures reflect planned but unidentified reductions of $63 million in 1995
and $85 million in 1996 under GEORGIA's business stategy to curtail growth in
costs.

                             GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION  (Continued)

    The Clean Air Act will have a significant impact on the capital
requirements of the Southern electric system.  This legislation, as well as
other legislation and regulations are described under "Environmental Issues" in
Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in GEORGIA's 1993 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

    As a result of requirements by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, GEORGIA
has established external sinking funds for the purpose of funding nuclear
decommissioning costs.  For 1994 through 1996, the amount to be funded for
GEORGIA totals $16 million annually.  For additional information concerning
nuclear decommissioning costs, see Note (C) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein.

    Cash requirements for long-term debt maturities and redemptions total
approximately $10.4 million for the twelve months ending March 31, 1995.

SOURCES OF FUNDS
GEORGIA expects to meet future capital requirements primarily using funds from
operations and, if needed, by the issuance of new debt and equity securities,
term loans and short-term borrowings.  Cash from operations for the first three
months of 1994 decreased, as compared to the corresponding period in 1993,
primarily because of the receipt in 1993 of cash payments from Gulf States as
partial settlement of litigation and higher estimated income tax payments in
1994.

    GEORGIA must comply with coverage requirements of its mortgage indenture
and corporate charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.
GEORGIA's ability to satisfy all coverage requirements is such that it could
issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock to provide sufficient funds
for all anticipated requirements.

    To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had approximately
$295 million of unused credit arrangements with banks at March 31, 1994.
Additionally, the completion of the remaining transactions for the sale of
Plant Scherer Unit 4 will generate approximately $130 million in both 1994 and
1995.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

    We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of March 31, 1994, and the related condensed
statements of income for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended March
31, 1994 and 1993, and the condensed statements of cash flows for the
three-month periods ended March 31, 1994 and 1993.  These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management.

    We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of
which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken
as a whole.  Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

    Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

    As more fully discussed in Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements,
an uncertainty exists with respect to the actions of the regulators regarding
the recoverability of the Company's investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped
storage hydroelectric project.  The outcome of this uncertainty cannot
presently be determined.  Accordingly, no provision for any writedown of the
costs associated with the Rocky Mountain facility resulting from the potential
actions of the Georgia Public Service Commission has been made in the
accompanying Condensed Financial Statements.

    We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1993
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 16, 1994, we included
an explanatory paragraph which describes an uncertainty with respect to the
actions of the regulators regarding the recoverability of the Company's
investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project.  In our
opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet
as of December 31, 1993, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
relation to the balance sheet from which it has been derived.

              MANAGEMENT'S OPINION AS TO FAIR STATEMENT OF RESULTS

    The condensed financial statements of GULF included herein have been
prepared by GULF, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
SEC.  In the opinion of GULF's management, the information regarding GULF
furnished herein reflects all adjustments (which included only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results for the periods ended
March 31, 1994 and 1993.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations, although GULF believes that the disclosures regarding GULF are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  It is suggested
that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and the notes thereto included in GULF's latest annual
report on Form 10-K.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS
GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first three months
of 1994 was $10.1 million, compared to $10.4 million for the same period of
1993.  The dip in earnings was primarily due to increased other operation
expenses as discussed below.

REVENUES
Retail energy sales for the first quarter of 1994 increased 2.3% over the
corresponding period of 1993 due primarily to the mild temperatures experienced
in the winter of 1993 and an increase in the number of customers served.
However, this increase in retail energy sales was partially offset because
GULF's formerly largest industrial customer began operating its co-generation
facility in August 1993.  Wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates increased
slightly, however, capacity revenues were $1 million lower, compared to the
first quarter of 1993.  Also, included in operating revenues for the first
quarter of 1994 is $1.9 million recognized under the Environmental Cost
Recovery clause.  This clause is discussed in Note 3 to the financial
statements in Item 8 to GULF's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

EXPENSES
Fuel expenses for the first quarter of 1994 decreased from the same period of
1993 despite a 2.8% increase in generation.  This reflects the impact of GULF
renegotiating, buying out or otherwise terminating various coal supply
contracts.  Purchased power transactions (both sales and purchases) among the
affiliated companies within the Southern electric system will vary from period
to period depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources at each company.  Other operation expenses increased because of the
recognition of higher costs associated with the buyouts and renegotiation of
coal supply contracts.  The expenses recognized are based, in part, on the
amount of fuel consumed at the generating plants.  These costs are recoverable
through the fuel clause and, thus, have no impact on earnings.  Other factors
that increased other operation expenses were higher employee benefit costs and
the recognition by GULF of its portion of the costs associated with a workforce
reduction program at the system service company.  Maintenance expenses
decreased because of the scheduling of maintenance on production facilities.
The increase in income tax expense is attributable to the federal tax rate
increase enacted in August 1993.

INTEREST CHARGES AND DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED STOCK
The decrease in interest on long-term debt reflects GULF's efforts to decrease
its capital costs.  GULF, in response to the low interest rate levels
prevailing during 1992 and 1993, refinanced a significant portion of its
long-term debt and preferred stock.  To the extent it is economically feasible,
GULF will continue its efforts to lower its capital costs.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

The level of future earnings depends on numerous factors ranging from
regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.

    Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, customer growth, and the rate of economic growth in GULF's service
area.  The enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the
future of the electric utility industry.  A discussion of the potential impact
of the Energy Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under
"Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
GULF's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    See Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 in GULF's 1993 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the hearings ordered by the FERC
regarding the reasonableness of the return on common equity on certain of the
Southern electric system's wholesale rate schedules and contracts.  Also
discussed therein is the FERC reconsideration concerning GULF's recovery of
certain coal contract buyout costs. On April 13, 1994, the FERC approved GULF's
Offer of Settlement regarding the return of certain wholesale fuel buyout costs
previously refunded to wholesale customers.  Also, see Note (I) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for a discussion of a suit filed against
GULF concerning the transportation of coal by barge.

    Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could reduce earnings if such
increased costs are not fully recovered.  The Clean Air Act is discussed
further under  "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in GULF's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  See Note 3 to the
financial statements in Item 8 in GULF's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Environmental Cost Recovery clause which provides for the
expected recovery of such costs.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The major change in GULF's financial condition during the first three months of
1994 was gross property additions of $20.7 million.  The principal sources of
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were provided from
operations and an increase in notes payable.  See the Condensed Statements of
Cash Flows for further details.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION
GULF's gross property additions, including those amounts related to
environmental compliance, are estimated to total approximately $200 million for
the three years 1994 through 1996 ($77 million in 1994, $55 million in 1995 and
$68 million in 1996).  The estimates of property additions for the three-year
period include $25 million committed to meeting the requirements of the Clean
Air Act, the cost

of which is expected to be recovered through the Environmental Cost Recovery
clause.  Actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of
factors such as the granting of timely and adequate rate increases, changes in
environmental regulations, revised load projections, the cost and efficiency of
construction labor, equipment, and materials, and the cost of capital.

    Various environmental legislation and other related regulations are
described in "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in GULF's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The full impact of these
requirements cannot be determined at this time, pending the development and
implementation of applicable regulations.

    In addition to the funds required for the construction program, $13.0
million will be required by March 31, 1995, in connection with maturities and
redemptions of long-term debt and preferred stock subject to mandatory
redemption.  This amount includes approximately $8.7 million of long-term notes
payable issued to finance the termination of a coal supply contract.

    At March 31, 1994, GULF had $2.7 million of cash and $31.5 million of
unused credit arrangements with banks to meet its short-term cash needs.  GULF
had $33.5 million of short-term bank borrowings outstanding at March 31, 1994.

    It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be derived
from operations, the sale of additional first mortgage bonds and preferred
stock, and capital contributions from SOUTHERN.  GULF is required to meet
certain coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate
charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.  GULF's coverage
ratios are sufficient to permit, at present interest rate levels, any
foreseeable security sales.  The amount of securities which GULF will be
permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market conditions and other
factors prevailing at that time.

                           MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NET INCOME
MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first
quarter of 1994 was $8.3 million, compared to $4.4 million for the
corresponding period of 1993.  Net income rose primarily because of higher
retail energy sales and retail rate increases under PEP and the ECO Plan.

REVENUES
Revenues for the first three months of 1994 increased compared to the same
period of 1993, because of an increase of 7.6% in retail energy sales, a 22.3%
increase in territorial wholesale energy sales and the retail rate increases
granted under PEP effective July 1993 and the ECO Plan effective in April 1993.
The increase in retail energy sales was due to weather influences, an improving
economy in Southeast Mississippi and an increase in the number of customers
served.  Energy sales to residential customers increased by 10.3% and to
commercial customers by 10.7%, with the latter reflecting sales to an
increasing number of casinos within MISSISSIPPI's service area.  Wholesale
capacity revenues decreased approximately $0.5 million.

EXPENSES
Fuel and purchased power expenses combined increased in the first quarter of
1994, compared to the corresponding period of 1993, due to higher energy sales.
Purchased power transactions (both sales and purchases) among the affiliated
companies within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company.  Taxes other than income taxes increased because of higher
property taxes and higher revenues.

    The increase in income tax expense reflects the increase in earnings and
the federal tax increase enacted in August 1993.

    The increase in interest was because of the sale or issuance of additional
debt instruments.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction.  The equity portion of AFUDC represents non-cash income.
However, when facilities are completed and included in rate base, previously
capitalized amounts increase cash flow because revenues are higher as a result
of the increased rate base and additional depreciation expense.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings is contingent upon
numerous factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.
Operating revenues will be affected by changes in rates under the PEP and ECO
plans.  The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force on electric rates, with
only moderate changes in rates taking place.  Also see Note (B) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for information regarding FERC's review
of equity returns.

    MISSISSIPPI's 1994 annual filing under the Environmental Compliance
Overview Plan with the Mississippi PSC resulted in an approved annual revenue
requirement of $7.6 million, effective in April 1994.  The FERC approved
MISSISSIPPI's wholesale rate increase petition for $3.6 million effective April
1994.

    Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors
have included the rate of economic growth in MISSISSIPPI's service area,
customer growth, competition, weather, changes in contracts with neighboring
utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, and the elasticity of
demand.  The enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the
future of the electric utility industry.  A discussion of the potential impact
of the Energy Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under
"Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
MISSISSIPPI's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
During the first three months of 1994, gross property additions were $27.0
million.  The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were
derived primarily from internal sources, the sale of $35 million of first
mortgage bonds and the issuance of $50 million of long-term notes payable.  See
the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

    At March 31, 1994, cash totaled approximately $1.0 million and MISSISSIPPI
had $96 million of unused credit arrangements with banks to meet short-term
cash needs.  MISSISSIPPI had $29 million of notes payable outstanding at
quarter-end.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION  (Continued)

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
MISSISSIPPI's gross property additions for the next three years are estimated
to be $256 million ($96 million in 1994, $62 million in 1995 and $98 million in
1996).  The major emphasis within the construction program will be on complying
with Clean Air Act regulations and upgrading existing facilities.  Revisions
may be necessary because of factors such as revised load projections, the
availability and cost of capital and changes in environmental regulations.

    Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the
Southern electric system's capital requirements and operating costs.  The acid
rain compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will have a significant impact
on the Southern electric system.  This legislation, as well as other
legislation and regulations, are described under "Environmental Matters" in
Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in MISSISSIPPI's 1993 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.  The full impact of these requirements cannot
be determined at this time pending the development and implementation of
applicable regulations.  MISSISSIPPI's management believes that the ECO Plan
will provide for retail recovery of the Clean Air Act costs.

    In addition to the funds required for the construction program,
approximately $20.8 million will be required by March 31, 1995, for maturities
of long-term debt.  It is anticipated that the funds required for construction
and other purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will
be derived from operations, the sale of additional first mortgage bonds,
pollution control bonds and preferred stock and the receipt of additional
capital contributions from SOUTHERN.  MISSISSIPPI is required to meet certain
coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter
to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.  MISSISSIPPI's coverage
ratios are sufficiently high to permit, at present interest rate levels, any
foreseeable security sales.  The amount of securities which MISSISSIPPI will be
able to issue in the future will depend upon market conditions and other
factors prevailing at that time.

                      SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS
SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first three
months of 1994 was $3.9 million, compared to $3.0 million in the corresponding
period of 1993.  The increase in net income was primarily due to higher retail
revenues.

REVENUES
Revenues for the first quarter of 1994 increased, compared to the corresponding
period in 1993, due to higher retail energy sales.  Energy sales to retail
customers increased 6.3% due to weather influences, an improving economy in
SAVANNAH's service territory and an increase in the number of customers served.
Wholesale energy sales to non-affiliated companies decreased, however, only the
capacity revenues of such sales have any measurable effect on earnings.
Capacity revenues fell $123,000.

EXPENSES
Fuel expenses during the first quarter of 1994 increased, compared to those
recorded in the first quarter of 1993, because generation almost tripled.  The
change in generation was due to demand in SAVANNAH's service area and elsewhere
in the Southeast.  Purchased power transactions among the affiliated companies
within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending
on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company.  These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.
Despite recording approximately $0.6 million for SAVANNAH's portion of the
costs related to a workforce reduction program at the system service company,
other operation expenses decreased.  This decrease reflects the savings
associated with SAVANNAH's workforce reduction program, which was implemented
in late 1993.  Income taxes were higher because of the change in net income and
higher federal income tax rates.

    The increases in interest on long-term debt and dividends on preferred
stock reflect the sale by SAVANNAH in 1993 of $45 million of first mortgage
bonds and $35 million of preferred stock.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction and is included in rate base.  The equity portion of AFUDC
represents non-cash income.  In addition, when facilities are completed and
included in rate base, previously capitalized amounts increase cash flow
because revenues are higher as a result of the increased rate base and
additional depreciation expense.  The amount of AFUDC recorded has risen
because of SAVANNAH's investment in the construction of two 80 megawatt
combustion turbine peaking units.  These units were placed in service in April
and May 1994.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION








RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

   Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
increased costs cannot be offset.  The Clean Air Act is discussed under
"Capital Requirements for Construction" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in SAVANNAH's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, and the rate of economic growth in SAVANNAH's service area.  The
enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the future of the
electric utility industry.  A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy
Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SAVANNAH's 1993
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
During the first three months of 1994, SAVANNAH made gross property additions
to utility plant of $7.8 million.  The funds for these additions and other
capital requirements came from an increase in long-term debt and from operating
activities, principally from earnings and noncash charges to income such as
depreciation.  See the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION
SAVANNAH's construction program is budgeted at $98 million for the three years
1994 through 1996 ($33 million in 1994, $32 million in 1995 and $33 million in
1996).  Actual construction costs may vary from this estimate because of such
factors as changes in environmental regulations; the cost and efficiency of
construction labor, equipment and materials; revised load projections and the
cost of capital.  The largest project during this period is the addition of two
80 megawatt combustion turbine units, which were placed in service in April and
May 1994.

   Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the
Southern electric system's capital requirements and operating costs.  The acid
rain compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will have a significant impact
on the Southern electric system.  This legislation, as well as other
legislation and regulations, are described under "Environmental Matters" in
Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SAVANNAH's 1993 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.  The full impact of these requirements cannot be determined at
this time, pending the development and implementation of applicable
regulations.  There can be no assurance that compliance costs will be recovered
through corresponding increases in rates.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION  (Continued)

SOURCES OF CAPITAL
At March 31, 1994, SAVANNAH has $4.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and
$32.5 million of unused credit arrangements with banks to meet its short-term
cash needs.  SAVANNAH had $2.0 million of short-term debt outstanding at
quarter-end.  Additionally, SAVANNAH has $4.5 million of leases and first
mortgage bonds maturing by March 31, 1995.  SAVANNAH has received the authority
from the SEC to have outstanding at any one time an amount of up to $70 million
in short-term borrowings.

    It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be derived
from operations and the sale of additional first mortgage bonds and preferred
stock and capital contributions from SOUTHERN.  SAVANNAH is required to meet
certain coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate
charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.  SAVANNAH's
coverage ratios are sufficiently high to permit, at present interest rate
levels, any foreseeable security sales.  The amount of securities which
SAVANNAH will be permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market
conditions and other factors prevailing at that time.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)  Reference is made to Item 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS in the SOUTHERN system's
     combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993
     for a description of the proceedings related to a derivative action filed
     against certain current and former directors and officers of SOUTHERN. In
     April 1994, the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded the
     case to the trial court, finding that allegations by the plaintiffs
     created a reasonable doubt that the board validly exercised its business
     judgment in refusing the earlier demand.

(B)  Reference is made to Note 3 to each of the registrant's, except SAVANNAH,
     notes to the financial statements in Item 8 in the SOUTHERN system's
     combined 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the hearings
     ordered by the FERC regarding the reasonableness of the return on common
     equity on certain of the Southern electric system's wholesale rate
     schedules and contracts and, in the case of GULF, FERC proceedings
     regarding recovery of certain coal contract buyout costs.  On April 13,
     1994, the FERC approved GULF's Offer of Settlement regarding the return of
     certain of its fuel contract buyout costs previously refunded to wholesale
     customers.  GULF recorded in 1993 the reversal of the $2.7 million refund
     arising from this issue.  The interest due GULF will not be material to
     GULF's financial statements.

(C)  Depreciation expense includes a provision for the expected costs of
     decommissioning nuclear facilities.  As approved by the respective public
     service commissions, annual provisions for nuclear decommissioning are
     based on an annuity (sinking fund) method, with deposits made each year to
     external trust funds.  Additionally, the amounts previously recorded in
     internal reserves are being transferred into the external trust funds over
     a set period of time.  It is expected that --over time-- the deposits and
     earnings of the trust funds will provide sufficient amounts to
     decontaminate nuclear facilities.  The estimated costs of decommissioning
     and the amounts being

        The actual decommissioning cost may vary from the above estimates
     because of regulatory requirements, changes in technology, and increased
     costs of labor, materials, and equipment.  The decommissioning cost
     estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the plant from
     service.  The estimates approved by the Georgia PSC for ratemaking exclude
     costs of non-radiated structures of $35 million for Plant Hatch and $62
     million for Plant Vogtle and site contingency costs of $55 million for
     Plant Hatch and $54 million for Plant Vogtle.  GEORGIA expects the Georgia
     PSC to periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the amounts collected
     in rates for the anticipated cost of decommissioning.

(D)  For information regarding nuclear insurance reference is made to Notes 13,
     11 and 4 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA,
     respectively, in Item 8 in the SOUTHERN system's combined 1993 Annual
     Report on Form 10-K.  Had ALABAMA and GEORGIA terminated their insurance
     coverages with NML as of December 31, 1993, they would have had a
     contingent right to receive amounts with present values of approximately
     $16 million

     and $11 million, respectively, payable over a twenty-year period
     commencing in 1996.  Any unpaid amounts, however, are subject to
     forfeiture in the event that NML's aggregate losses in any subsequent
     two-year period exceed $300 million or fifty percent of its surplus.  The
     accounting for any such amounts actually received would be subject to
     regulatory treatment.

(E)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
     ALABAMA in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1993 Annual Report on
     Form 10-K for information with respect to a civil complaint filed
     regarding ALABAMA's financing of heat pumps and other merchandise.

(F)  Pursuant to orders from the Georgia PSC, GEORGIA deferred financing and
     depreciation costs under phase-in plans for Plant Vogtle units 1 and 2
     until the allowed investment was fully reflected in rates as of October
     1991.  In addition, the Georgia PSC issued two separate accounting orders
     that required GEORGIA to defer substantially all operating and financing
     costs related to bGeorgiatPSCnorderstprovidesfordrecoveryhofedeferred
     costs within 10 years.  The Georgia PSC also ordered GEORGIA to levelize
     declining capacity buyback expense from the co-owners of the plant over a
     six-year period beginning October 1991.  The unamortized balance of these
     deferred costs at March 31, 1994, was $494 million.

(G)  Reference is made to Note 4 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA, in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1993 Annual Report on
     Form 10-K for information concerning the uncertainty related to the
     actions of regulatory authorities with respect to the recovery of costs of
     the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project and preliminary
     discussions between GEORGIA and other parties regarding the potential sale
     of GEORGIA's remaining interest in the Rocky Mountain project.  The
     ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

(H)  In October 1993, a Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia,  judge ruled
     that rate riders previously approved by the Georgia PSC for recovery of
     GEORGIA's costs incurred in connection with demand-side conservation
     programs were unlawful.  The judge held that the Georgia PSC lacked
     statutory authority to approve such rate riders except through general
     rate case proceedings and that those procedures had not been followed.
     GEORGIA has suspended collection of the demand-side conservation costs and
     appealed the court's decision to the Georgia Court of Appeals.  In
     December 1993, the Georgia PSC approved GEORGIA's request for an
     accounting order allowing GEORGIA to defer all current unrecovered and
     future costs related to those programs until the court's decision is
     reversed or until the next general rate case proceeding.  An association
     of industrial customers has filed a petition for review of such accounting
     order in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia.  GEORGIA's costs
     related to these conservation programs through March 1994 were $79 million
     of which $15 million has been collected and the remainder deferred.  The
     estimated costs, assuming no change in the programs certified by the
     Georgia PSC, are $38 million in 1994 and $40 million in 1995.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)

        The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined; however, in
     management's opinion, the final outcome will not have a material adverse
     effect on SOUTHERN's or GEORGIA's Condensed Financial Statements.

(I)  In August 1993, a complaint against GULF and SCS was filed in federal
     district court in Ohio by two companies with which GULF has contracted for
     the transportation by barge of certain of GULF's coal supplies.  The
     complaint alleges breach of the contract by GULF and seeks damages
     estimated by the plaintiffs to be in excess of $85 million.

        While the final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined, in the
     opinion of management it will not have a material adverse effect on
     SOUTHERN's or GULF's Condensed Financial Statements.

(J)  In September 1993, MISSISSIPPI filed a $3.6-million wholesale rate
     increase request with the FERC.  Prior to this filing, MISSISSIPPI
     conferred and negotiated a settlement with all its wholesale requirements
     customers, who have executed and filed a Settlement Agreement and
     Certificates of Concurrence with the FERC.  In March 1994, the FERC
     notified MISSISSIPPI that it has accepted the wholesale rate increase as
     filed effective April 1994.

(K)  During the first quarter of 1994, GEORGIA and SCS, the system service
     company, instituted workforce reduction programs.  The costs related to
     these programs amounted to approximately $72.6 million for GEORGIA and
     $22.3 million for SCS.  The costs of the SCS workforce reduction program
     were apportioned among the various entities that together form the
     Southern electric system.  Additionally, SAVANNAH instituted a workforce

PART II       -    OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.            Legal Proceedings.

              (1)  Reference is made to the Notes to Condensed Financial
                   Statements herein for information regarding certain legal
                   and administrative proceedings in which SOUTHERN and its
                   reporting subsidiaries are involved.

              (2)  In May 1994, GEORGIA received a notice of violation from the
                   NRC proposing a civil penalty in the amount of $200,000
                   based upon allegedly inaccurate and incomplete information
                   relating to Plant Vogtle reported to the NRC in 1990.  The
                   NRC also issued demands for information regarding alleged
                   performance failures by six individual employees to enable
                   the NRC to determine whether additional enforcement actions
                   are necessary.  GEORGIA has not yet determined its response
                   to the NRC.
