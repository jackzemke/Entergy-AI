                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   FIRST QUARTER 2003 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2002


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Southern Company is focusing on three main businesses in
the Southeast: its traditional business, represented by its five operating
companies providing regulated retail electric service in four states; a growing
competitive generation business in the Super Southeast; and energy-related
products and services for its retail customers. For additional information on
these businesses, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Operating Companies," "Southern
Power" and "Other Business" in the Form 10-K.

Earnings

Southern Company's first quarter 2003 earnings were $298 million ($0.41
per share) compared with $224 million ($0.32 per share) in the first quarter
2002. The increase in earnings for the first quarter 2003 is due to a number of
positive factors, including increased demand for electricity, continued customer
growth, solid performance by the competitive generation business and the overall
impact of regulatory rate proceedings in Alabama and Florida, partially offset
by the impact of higher operating expenses related to generating units that were
placed in service in 2002. Lower than normal temperatures in the first quarter
2003 resulted in increased demand for energy when compared to the corresponding
period in 2002.

    Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                 Increase (Decrease)
                                         -------------------------------------
                                                    First Quarter
                                         -------------------------------------
                                             (in thousands)          %
Retail sales..........................       $130,125                7.1
Sales for resale......................        106,482               45.8
Other electric revenues...............         28,460               44.9
Other revenues........................         74,247              100.6
Fuel expense..........................        136,134               23.7
Purchased power expense...............         69,485              102.8
Other operation expense...............         48,614               10.9
Equity in losses of unconsolidated
   subsidiaries.......................         11,263               70.8
Leveraged lease income................          3,014               20.5
Other income (expense), net...........         15,773               78.6

         Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect
net income, retail sales revenue was up by $57.5 million, or 4.4%, in the first
quarter 2003 when compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. Energy
sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers for the first quarter
2003 increased by 4.3%, 1.1% and 4.0%, respectively, as compared to the same
reporting period in 2002. Colder weather and customer growth significantly
impacted energy sales to these customers in the first quarter 2003 when compared
to the same period in the prior year.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Sales for resale. During the first quarter 2003, sales for resale increased
due to increases in both the demand and price of energy sold when compared to
the same period in 2002.

     Other electric revenues. During the first quarter 2003, other electric
revenues increased primarily due to higher revenue from cogeneration steam
facilities resulting from higher gas prices and demand, increased revenues from
transmission to others and higher fees charged for connection, reconnection and
collection. Since cogeneration steam revenues are generally offset by fuel
expenses, these revenues do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. For the first quarter 2003, other revenues increased
primarily due to revenues from Southern Company GAS, which began operations in
August 2002.

     Fuel expense. The increase in fuel expense for the first quarter 2003 can
be primarily attributed to fuel expenses at Southern Company GAS, increased
generation to meet higher demand, the commercial operation of Southern Power's
Plant Franklin Unit 1 and Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 in June 2002, and an
increase of over 100% in the unit cost for natural gas.

     Purchased power expense. The increase in purchased power expense during the
first quarter 2003 was mainly the result of higher demand for energy and
increased prices for these energy purchases when compared to the corresponding
period in 2002.

     Other operations expense. During the first quarter 2003, the increase in
other operations expense is attributed to a number of factors. Primary factors
include higher administrative and general expenses, higher transmission and
distribution expenses and expenses at Southern Company GAS, which began
operations in August 2002.

     Equity in losses of subsidiaries. The increase in losses from
unconsolidated subsidiaries in the first quarter 2003 as compared to the same
period in 2002 related to higher operating losses from Southern Company's
investments in alternative fuel partnerships. These losses are offset by income
tax credits generated by such partnerships.

     Leveraged lease income. In the first quarter 2003, leveraged lease income
increased mainly due to the effect of a new lease transaction involving a
coal-fired electric generation facility in Mississippi that Southern Company
completed in late December 2002.

     Other income (expense), net. The increase in this item during the first
quarter 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002 is primarily due to mark
to market adjustments for derivative electric contracts, a decrease in
non-utility expenses at Alabama Power and higher income associated with a new
electricity pricing program at Georgia Power.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors. The two major factors are the ability of the operating companies to
maintain a stable regulatory environment and achieve energy sales growth while
containing costs and the profitability of the competitive market-based wholesale
generating business. For additional information relating to these issues, see
Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of Southern Company in the Form 10-K.

   Reference is made to Note 11 to the financial statements of Southern Company
in Item 8 and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS-"Future Earnings Potential"
in Item 7 of the Form 10-K and to Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for information relating to the spin-off of Mirant from Southern Company.
Mirant recently filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2002, which included its restated financial statements for the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000. The effect of these restatements on Southern
Company's financial statements, if any, cannot be determined until Mirant's 2001
revised quarterly financial statements are filed. However, Southern Company's
management does not currently anticipate that a reaudit of Southern Company's
2000 or 2001 financial statements will be necessary.

     Southern Company's business activities are subject to extensive
governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation
over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property
damage, personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements,
has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal
injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have
become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation currently filed
against Southern Company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this time;
however, after consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate
that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a
material adverse effect on Southern Company's financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, including the EPA litigation, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the
financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. On May 7,
2003, the U.S. District Court in Alabama extended the stay of the EPA litigation
proceeding in Alabama until the earlier of August 5, 2003 or a ruling by the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the related litigation
involving TVA.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Southern Company in the Form 10-K
for information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice
of proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Evident in the
White Paper are continuing differences in opinion between the FERC and various
state regulatory commissions over questions of jurisdiction and protection of
retail customers. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any
impact of this proposal on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on
the form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Southern
Company's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities could be adversely affected
by changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its regional power
market.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding the proposed terminations of three PPAs between
subsidiaries of Dynegy and Mississippi Power and Southern Power. Reference is
also made to Notes (C) through (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for discussion of various contingencies and other matters which may affect
future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Southern Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
the financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.
Southern Company's only critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. The
operating companies are subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,
"Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a
portion of a company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, the
company would be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities
that are not specifically recoverable and determine if any other assets,
including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (H) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Southern Company
accrued for the ultimate cost of retiring most long-lived assets over the life
of the related asset through depreciation expense.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in Southern Company's financial condition during the first three
months of 2003 included $535 million used for gross property additions to
utility plant. The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were
primarily obtained from issuances of senior notes and other long-term debt. See
Southern Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows herein for
further details.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

Reference is made to Note 9 to the financial statements of Southern Company in
Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note 8 to the financial statements of Mississippi
Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding Mississippi Power's
lease agreement with Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership ("Escatawpa"). Under
this agreement, Escatawpa, a special purpose entity, is the owner-lessor of the
combined-cycle generating units at Mississippi Power's Plant Daniel.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Mississippi Power is currently working to restructure this agreement so
that it will continue to be accounted for as an operating lease. The
restructured agreement should be completed in June 2003, prior to the required
implementation date of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Certain
Special-Purpose Entities." If the agreement is not restructured, Interpretation
No. 46 will require that Mississippi Power consolidate the assets and
liabilities of Escatawpa effective July 1, 2003.

Credit Rating Risk

Southern Company and its subsidiaries do not have any credit agreements that
would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result
of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts that could require
collateral -- but not accelerated payment -- in the event of a credit rating
change to below investment grade. These contracts are primarily for physical
electricity sales, fixed-price physical gas purchases and agreements covering
interest rate swaps. At March 31, 2003, the maximum potential collateral
requirements under the electricity sale contracts and financial instrument
agreements were approximately $425 million. Generally, collateral may be
provided for by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit or cash. At March
31, 2003, there were no material collateral requirements for the gas purchase
contracts.

Exposure to Market Risks

Southern Company's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have
not changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Southern Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, the operating companies have limited
exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and
prices of electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in
electricity prices, the operating companies and Southern Power enter into fixed
price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market and, to a lesser extent, similar contracts for gas purchases.
Also, the operating companies have each implemented fuel-hedging programs at the
instruction of their respective PSCs. The fair value of derivative energy
contracts at March 31, 2003 was as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to the PSC-approved fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory
assets and liabilities. Realized gains and losses from these programs are
included in fuel expense and are recovered through the operating companies' fuel
cost recovery clauses. In addition, unrealized gains and losses on electric and
gas contracts used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales are deferred in
Other Comprehensive Income. Gains and losses on contracts that do not represent
hedges are recognized in the Statements of Income as incurred. At March 31,
2003, the fair value of derivative energy contracts reflected in the financial

     For the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately $0.5 million
and $9.8 million, respectively, of losses were recognized in income.

     Southern Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of
nonperformance by the parties to the derivative energy contracts. Southern
Company's policy is to enter into agreements with counterparties that have
investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P; therefore Southern Company
does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional
information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
- - "Market Price Risk" of Southern Company in the Form 10-K, Note 1 to the
financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (G)
to the Condensed Financial Statements herein.

Financing Activities

During the first quarter 2003, Southern Company subsidiaries issued $1,085
million of senior notes and $14 million of pollution control revenue bonds. The
issuances were used to refund $909 million of first mortgage bonds and long-term
senior notes. The remainder was used to reduce short-term debt and fund ongoing
construction programs. Reference is made to Southern Company's Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows herein for further details on financing
activities during the first quarter 2003.

     The market price of Southern Company's common stock at March 31, 2003 was
$28.44 per share and the book value was $12.30 per share, representing a
market-to-book ratio of 231%, compared to $28.39, $12.16 and 233%, respectively,
at the end of 2002. The dividend for the first quarter 2003 was $0.3425 per
share compared to $0.335 per share in the first quarter of 2002.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements for Construction," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" of Southern Company in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern
Company system's capital requirements for its construction program, sinking fund
requirements, maturing debt and environmental compliance efforts. Approximately
$1.4 billion will be required by March 31, 2004 for redemptions and maturities
of long-term debt. Also, Southern Company and its subsidiaries plan to continue,
to the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and replace these
securities with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, Southern Company
may require additional equity capital over the next several years. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised will be contingent on
Southern Company's investment opportunities. The operating companies and
Southern Power plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily
internal sources and the issuances of new debt and preferred equity securities,
term loans and short-term borrowings. However, the amount, type and timing of
any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon market conditions and regulatory
approval. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" of Southern Company in
the Form 10-K for additional information.

     Southern Company's current liabilities exceed current assets because of the
continued use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs as well
as scheduled maturities of long-term debt.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Southern Company
system had at March 31, 2003 approximately $309 million of cash and cash
equivalents and approximately $4.2 billion of unused credit arrangements with
banks, of which $2.9 billion expire in 2003 and $1.25 billion expire in 2004 and
beyond. Of the facilities maturing in 2003, $2.7 billion contain provisions
allowing two-year term loans executable at the expiration date. These unused
credit arrangements also provide liquidity support to variable rate pollution
control bonds and commercial paper programs. Due to a reduction of commercial
paper and variable rate pollution bonds requiring liquidity support, the
Southern Company system plans to reduce its credit arrangements to $3.5 billion
by the end of June 2003. The operating companies may also meet short-term cash
needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell
commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for the
benefit of each of the operating companies. At March 31, 2003, the Southern
Company system had extendible commercial notes outstanding of $19.9 million,
short-term notes payable outstanding of $20 million and commercial paper
outstanding of $1.46 billion. Management believes that the need for working
capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining
large cash balances.

Item 3.       Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Market Price Risk"
herein for each registrant and Note 1 to the financial statements of each
registrant in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Reference is also made to Note (I) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for information relating to derivative
instruments.

Item 4.       Controls and Procedures.

(a)      Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

Within 90 days of the filing date of this quarterly report, Southern Company,
the operating companies and Southern Power conducted separate evaluations under
the supervision and with the participation of each company's management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Sections 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon those evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer, in each case, concluded that the disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to
material information relating to each company (including its consolidated
subsidiaries) required to be included in periodic filings with the SEC.

(b)      Changes in internal controls.

There have been no significant changes in Southern Company's, the operating
companies' or Southern Power's internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect these internal controls subsequent to the date each company
carried out its evaluation.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2003 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2002


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Alabama Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first
quarter 2003 was $91.8 million compared to $72.5 million for the corresponding
period of 2002. Earnings in the first quarter 2003 increased by $19.3 million or
26.6% primarily due to increases in territorial sales, retail rates and other
operating revenues. These increases in revenues were partially offset by
increased non-fuel operating expenses in the first quarter 2003 when compared to
the first quarter 2002.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                       Increase (Decrease)

         Retail sales. Excluding energy cost recovery revenues, which generally
do not affect net income, retail sales revenues were higher by $20.5 million, or
4.3%, for the first quarter 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002.
Energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers increased by
2.3%, 4.8% and 3.5%, respectively, for the first quarter 2003 when compared to
the corresponding period of 2002 primarily due to favorable weather conditions
and slight sales growth. A 2 percent increase in retail base rates, effective
April 2002, also increased retail sales revenues in the first quarter 2003.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. During the first quarter 2003, the
revenues associated with sales for resale - non-affiliates increased due to a
20.3% increase in energy sold and an 8.7% increase in price when compared to the
same period in 2002. Sales of energy will vary depending on demand, market based
prices and the availability of system generation.

                              ALABAMA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies within the Southern Company
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. In the first quarter 2003, the increase in other revenues
is primarily attributed to an $8.5 million increase in revenues from
cogeneration steam facilities due to higher gas prices and demand, a $4.1
million increase in revenues from transmission to others and a $3.5 million
increase in revenues from higher fees charged to customers for connection,
reconnection and collection. Since cogeneration steam revenues are generally
offset by fuel expenses, these revenues do not have a significant impact on
earnings.

     Fuel expense. The increase in fuel expense during the first quarter 2003
when compared to the same period in 2002 was primarily attributed to a 6.7%
increase in generation to meet higher demand for energy and a 131.7% increase in
natural gas prices. Since energy expenses are generally offset by energy
revenues, these expenses did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. In the first quarter 2003, purchased
power expense from non-affiliates increased due to a 139% increase in price even
though overall purchases of energy decreased 11.7% when compared to the
corresponding period in 2002. The purchase of energy decreased due to the
increased utilization of electricity within the Southern Company system with the
addition of 2,279 megawatts of generation placed into commercial operation
during 2002. These expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings since
energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's
energy cost recovery clause.

     Other operation expense. The increase in other operation expense is mainly
a result of a $6.9 million increase in administrative and general expenses, a
$1.0 million increase in distribution expense, a $1.0 million increase in
customer accounts expense and a $1.0 million increase in sales expense during
the first quarter 2003 when compared to the corresponding period in 2002. The
increase in administrative and general expenses primarily relates to a $2.2
million increase in expense for property insurance and a $3.7 million increase
in employee benefits.

     Allowance for equity funds used during construction. During the first
quarter 2003, the allowance for equity funds used during construction increased
primarily due to the construction of selective catalytic reduction facilities at
Plant Miller.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary. During the first
quarter 2003, the decrease in distributions on preferred securities of
subsidiary is primarily attributed to the refinancing of higher distribution
rate trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter of 2002.

     Other income (expense), net. The decrease in other expense for the first
quarter 2003, when compared to the same period in 2002, is primarily due to a
$3.2 million increase in an unrealized gain relating to mark to market
adjustments for derivative electric contracts as required by FASB Statement No.
133 and a $1.8 million decrease in non-utility expenses when compared to the
corresponding period in the prior year. See "Exposure to Market Risks" herein
for additional information related to derivative energy contracts.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including Alabama Power's ability to achieve energy sales growth while
containing costs and maintaining a stable regulatory environment. Growth in
energy sales is subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather,
competition, new short- and long-term contracts with neighboring utilities,
energy conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand and the
rate of economic growth in Alabama Power's service area. For additional
information relating to these issues, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Risk Factors" and
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
Alabama Power in the Form 10-K.

     Alabama Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has
increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. Even though the potential for such litigation exists, the
possible outcome cannot be predicted at this time.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, including the EPA litigation, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the
financial statements of Alabama Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. On May 7,
2003, the U.S. District Court in Alabama extended the stay of the EPA litigation
proceeding in Alabama until the earlier of August 5, 2003 or a ruling by the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the related litigation
involving TVA.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "FERC
Matters" of Alabama Power in the Form 10-K for information on the formation of
an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice of proposed rulemaking regarding
open access transmission service and standard electricity market design. In
April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related to its proposed rulemaking
regarding open access transmission service and standard electricity market
design in an effort to respond to certain of the public comments received on the
standard market design proposal. Evident in the White Paper are continuing
differences in opinion between the FERC and various state regulatory commissions
over questions of jurisdiction and protection of retail customers. Pending
energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any impact of this proposal on
Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on the form in which final
rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Alabama Power's revenues, expenses,
assets and liabilities could be adversely affected by changes in the
transmission regulatory structure in its regional power market.

     Reference is also made to Notes (A), (E), (F) and (I) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Alabama Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of Alabama Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Alabama
Power's only critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. Alabama Power
is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a portion of Alabama
Power's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, Alabama Power would
be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
specifically recoverable and determine if any other assets, including plant,
have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (H) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Alabama Power accrued
for the ultimate cost of retiring most long-lived assets over the life of the
related asset through depreciation expense.

     There was no cumulative effect to net income resulting from the adoption of
Statement No. 143. Alabama Power received an accounting order from the Alabama
PSC to defer the transition adjustment; therefore, Alabama Power recorded a
related regulatory liability of $71 million to reflect Alabama Power's
regulatory treatment of these costs under Statement No. 71. The initial
Statement No. 143 liability Alabama Power recognized was $301 million, of which
$310 million was reclassified from the accumulated depreciation reserve. The
amount capitalized to property, plant, and equipment was $63 million. Reference
is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under "Regulatory
Assets and Liabilities" and "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8
of the Form 10-K.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in Alabama Power's financial condition during the first three
months of 2003 included the addition of approximately $190 million to utility
plant. The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operating activities. See Alabama Power's Condensed Statements of
Cash Flows herein for further details.

Credit Rating Risk

Alabama Power does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Exposure to Market Risks

Alabama Power's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Alabama Power is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, Alabama Power has limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Alabama Power enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and
sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser
extent, similar contracts for gas purchases. Alabama Power has also implemented
a retail fuel hedging program at the instruction of the Alabama PSC. The fair
value of derivative energy contracts at March 31, 2003 was as follows:

clause. Gains and losses on contracts that do not represent hedges are

Financing Activities

In January 2003, Alabama Power redeemed $194 million of Series A 7 1/8% Senior
Notes due December 1, 2047 from proceeds obtained from Alabama Power's December
2002 issuance of $200 million Series S 5 7/8% Senior Notes due December 1, 2022.

     In February 2003, Alabama Power issued 1,250 shares ($125 million aggregate
stated capital) of Flexible Money Market Class A Preferred Stock (Series 2003A),
cumulative, par value $1 per share (stated capital $100,000 per share). The
proceeds from the sale were used to repay a portion of Alabama Power's
outstanding short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes,
including Alabama Power's continuous construction program.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In April 2003, Alabama Power issued $195 million of Series W Floating Rate
Extendible Senior Notes due April 23, 2006, the initial maturity date, unless
the maturity of all or a portion of the principal amount is extended by
investors to April 23, 2007. The proceeds from the sale were used by Alabama
Power for general corporate purposes, including Alabama Power's continuous
construction program.

     After approval of an increase in authorized shares of common stock by
stockholders in April 2003, Alabama Power issued 312,500 shares of common stock
to Southern Company at $40.00 a share ($12,500,000 aggregate purchase price).
The proceeds from the sale will be used by Alabama Power for general corporate
purposes.

     In May 2003, Alabama Power issued $250 million of Series X 3.125% Senior
Notes due May 1, 2008. The proceeds from this sale will be used to repay at
maturity, in May 2003, $250 million in aggregate principal amount of the Series
M 7.85% Senior Notes due May 15, 2003.

     Alabama Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to
retire higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit. Capital RequirementsReference is made to Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of Alabama Power under "Capital
Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Matters" in the
Form 10-K for a description of Alabama Power's capital requirements for its
construction program, maturing debt and environmental compliance efforts.Sources
of CapitalIn addition to the financing activities previously described herein,
Alabama Power plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of
adequate earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other
factors. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for
additional information.

     Alabama Power's current liabilities exceed current assets because of
scheduled maturities of long-term debt.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Alabama Power had at March
31, 2003 approximately $28.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, unused
committed lines of credit of approximately $923 million (including $454 million
of such lines which are dedicated to funding purchase obligations relating to
variable rate pollution control bonds) and an extendible commercial note
program. Due to a reduction of commercial paper, Alabama Power plans to reduce
committed lines of credit to approximately $800 million in June 2003. Of these
lines of credit, unless extended, $533 million expire at various times in 2003
and $390 million expire in 2004. Alabama Power may also meet short-term cash
needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell
commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for the
benefit of Alabama Power and other Southern Company subsidiaries. Alabama Power
has regulatory authority for up to $1.0 billion of short-term borrowings. At
March 31, 2003, Alabama Power had no outstanding commercial paper or notes
payable to banks. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2003 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2002

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EarningsGeorgia Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the
first quarter 2003 was $133.3 million compared to $126.7 million for the
corresponding period in 2002. Earnings in the first quarter 2003 increased by
$6.6 million, or 5.2%, primarily due to increased operating revenues which were
partially offset by increased non-fuel operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                    Increase (Decrease)
                                            ---------------------------------
                                                       First Quarter
                                            ---------------------------------
                                                (in thousands)          %
Retail sales...........................          $60,793                6.7
Sales for resale - non-affiliates......           23,936               47.8

Depreciation and amortization..........          (10,055)             (10.5)
Other income (expense), net............            8,344              353.4

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue increased in the first quarter 2003 by $22.7
million, or 3.5%, when compared to the corresponding period in 2002. Colder
weather is the primary reason for the increase in retail sales revenues. Energy
sales to residential customers increased 7.6% in the first quarter 2003 when
compared to the same period in 2002. Energy sales to commercial customers
declined by 0.8%, while energy sales to the industrial sector rose by 5.1%,
compared to the first quarter 2002.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. Energy sales for resale to
non-affiliates increased 43.5% during the first quarter 2003 as a direct result
of increased demand for energy by these non-affiliates. These transactions did
not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is usually sold at
variable cost.
     Sales for resale - affiliates. Revenues from sales for resale to affiliated
companies within the Southern Company system will vary depending on demand and
the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. Energy sales
increased 160.3% when compared to the first quarter 2002. These transactions did
not have a significant impact on earnings.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel expense. The first quarter 2003 increase is mainly due to increased
generation related to the higher demand for energy when compared to the same
period in the prior year and an increase of approximately 129% in the average
cost of natural gas. These expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings
since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Georgia
Power's fuel cost recovery clause.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. In the first quarter 2003, purchased
power from non-affiliates increased primarily due to higher gas prices and an
18.2% increase in the demand for energy. These expenses do not have a
significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by
energy revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery clause.

     Purchased power - affiliates. The increase in the first quarter 2003 is
principally attributed to the PPAs between Georgia Power and Southern Power
that began in June 2002. The capacity component of these transactions totaled
$23.6 million in the first quarter 2003. The energy component of power purchased
from affiliated companies within the Southern Company system will vary
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company and will have no significant impact on earnings since energy
expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Georgia Power's fuel
cost recovery clause.

     Other operation expense. During the first quarter 2003, other operation
expense increased from the same period in 2002 mainly due to increases of $3.2
million in transmission and distribution, $2.6 million in fossil power
generation, $1.7 million in customer accounting expenses and $2.1 million in
property insurance.

     Maintenance expense. In the first quarter 2003, maintenance expense was
higher than the amount recorded in the first quarter of 2002, principally due to
increased scheduled work on steam generating facilities and distribution
facilities.

     Depreciation and amortization. The decrease in this item for the first
quarter 2003 is primarily due to lower regulatory charges necessary to levelize
purchased power costs under the terms of the retail rate order effective January
1, 2002. The decrease is offset by an increase in purchased power costs
discussed above. All purchased power costs will be reflected in rates evenly
over the next three years under the retail rate order effective January 1, 2002.
     Other income (expense), net. The first quarter 2003 increase in this item
when compared to the same period in 2002 is partially the result of both higher
income associated with a new electricity pricing program and mark to market
adjustments for derivative energy contracts. See "Exposure to Market Risks"
herein for additional information related to derivative energy contracts.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales. For additional information relating to these issues, see Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of Georgia Power in the Form 10-K.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In January 2002, Georgia Power began operating under a three-year retail
rate order. Under the terms of the order, earnings will be evaluated annually
against a retail return on common equity range of 10 percent to 12.95 percent.
Two-thirds of any earnings above the 12.95 percent return will be applied to
rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. Retail
rates were decreased by $118 million effective January 1, 2002. Reference is
made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings
Potential" and Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power in Item 8 of
the Form 10-K for additional information.

     Beginning in June 2002, Georgia Power began purchases under PPAs with
Southern Power which will result in higher capacity and operating and
maintenance payments. Purchases under PPAs will be reflected in rates evenly
over the next three years under the retail rate order effective January 1, 2002.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Georgia Power in the Form 10-K for
information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice of
proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Evident in the
White Paper are continuing differences in opinion between the FERC and various
state regulatory commissions over questions of jurisdiction and protection of
retail customers. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any
impact of this proposal on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on
the form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Georgia
Power's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities could be adversely affected
by changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its regional power
market.

     In June 2002, Georgia Power entered into a fifteen-year PPA beginning in
June 2005 with Southern Power to purchase 1,040 megawatts of capacity from the
planned combined-cycle plant at Plant McIntosh to be built and owned by Southern
Power. The annual capacity cost is expected to be approximately $72 million.
Reference is made to Note (L) to the Condensed Financial Statements for
information regarding the FERC approval process for this PPA.

     Additionally, Georgia Power has entered into a seven-year PPA beginning in
June 2005 with Duke Energy Trading & Marketing to purchase 620 megawatts with an
average annual capacity cost of approximately $48 million. Reference is made to
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" and
Note 4 under "Purchased Power Commitments" to the financial statements of
Georgia Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For additional
information, including information on the EPA litigation, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND Analysis - "Environmental Matters" of Georgia Power
and Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power in Item 8 of the Form
10-K.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Georgia Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has
increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation currently filed against
Georgia Power cannot be predicted at this time; however, after consultation with
legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any,
arising from such proceedings would have a material adverse effect on Georgia
Power's financial statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (A), (E) through (G), (I), (K) and (L) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Georgia Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of Georgia Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Georgia
Power's only critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. Georgia Power
is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a portion of Georgia
Power's operations is no longer subject to these provisions,
Georgia Power would be required to write off related regulatory assets and
liabilities that are not specifically recoverable and determine if any other
assets, including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (H) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No.
143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003.
Statement No. 143 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The
present value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be
recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
asset's useful life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit
non-regulated companies to continue accruing future retirement costs for
long-lived assets that they do not have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to
January 2003, Georgia Power accrued for the ultimate cost of retiring most
long-lived assets over the life of the related asset through depreciation
expense.

   There was no cumulative effect adjustment to net income resulting from the
adoption of Statement No. 143. Georgia Power received permission from the
Georgia PSC to defer the transition adjustment; therefore, Georgia Power
recorded a related regulatory asset of $21 million to reflect the regulatory
treatment of these costs under Statement No. 71 as of January 2003. The initial
Statement No. 143 liability Georgia Power recognized was $469 million, of which
$332 million was removed from the accumulated depreciation reserve. The amount
capitalized to property, plant, and equipment was $116 million.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in Georgia Power's financial condition during the first three
months of 2003 was the addition of  approximately $191 million to utility
plant. The funds for these additions and  other capital requirements were
derived primarily from operations. See Georgia Power's Condensed Statements of
Cash Flows herein for further details.

Credit Rating Risk

Georgia Power does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade. There are certain physical electricity sales contracts that could
require collateral -- but not termination -- in the event of a credit rating
change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided for by a
Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit or cash. At March 31, 2003, the
maximum potential collateral requirements were approximately $228 million.

Exposure to Market Risks

Georgia Power's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed  materially  compared with the December 31, 2002  reporting  period.  In
addition,  Georgia Power is not aware of any facts or  circumstances  that would
significantly  affect such  exposures in the near term.  Due to cost-based  rate
regulations, Georgia Power has limited exposure to market volatility in interest
rates,  commodity fuel prices and prices of  electricity.  To mitigate  residual
risks  relative to movements in  electricity  prices,  Georgia Power enters into
fixed price  contracts  for the  purchase  and sale of  electricity  through the
wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent,  similar contracts for gas
purchases.  Georgia Power has also  implemented a retail fuel hedging program at
the  instruction  of the  Georgia  PSC.  The  fair  value of  derivative  energy
contracts at March 31, 2003 was as follows:

     Realized gains and losses are recognized in the Statements of Income as
incurred. For the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately $0.2
million and $2.5 million, respectively, of losses were recognized in income.

     For additional information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Exposure to Market Risks" of Georgia Power in the
Form 10-K and Note 1 to the financial statements of Georgia Power in Item 8 of
the Form 10-K.

Financing Activities

In February  2003,  Georgia  Power issued $250 million of Series L Floating
Rate Senior Notes due February 18, 2005.  The proceeds  from this  issuance were
used to repay a portion of Georgia Power's outstanding short-term  indebtedness.
Also in February  2003,  Georgia  Power  issued  $150  million of Series M 5.40%
Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due March 1, 2033. A portion of the proceeds were
used to redeem in March 2003 the $145 million  outstanding  principal  amount of
Georgia Power's Series A 6 7/8% Senior Public Income Notes due December 31, 2047
and the balance of the proceeds was used to repay a portion of Georgia  Power's
outstanding short-term indebtedness.


     During March 2003, Georgia Power elected to change the interest rate mode
on $316 million of variable rate pollution control bonds. Georgia Power changed
$255 million of the bonds from the "daily rate mode", which required backup bank
credit facilities, to the "auction rate mode." In addition, Georgia Power
changed $61 million of the bonds from the "daily rate mode" to the "long-term
interest rate mode."

     In April 2003, Georgia Power issued $100 million of Series N 5.750% Senior
Notes due April 15, 2023. The proceeds from this sale were used to repay a
portion of Georgia Power's outstanding short-term indebtedness. In addition, in
April 2003, Georgia Power issued $150 million of Series O 5.90% Senior Notes due
April 15, 2033. The proceeds from this sale were used to repay at maturity all
of Georgia Power's Series I 5.25% Senior Notes due May 8, 2003. Further, in
April 2003, Georgia Power issued $50 million of Series P Floating Rate Senior
Notes due April 15, 2005. The proceeds from this sale were used to repay a
portion of Georgia Power's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     Georgia Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to
retire higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of Georgia
Power under "Financing Activities", "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of Georgia Power's
capital requirements for its construction program, maturing debt and
environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

Georgia Power plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of
adequate earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other
factors. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for
additional information.

     Georgia Power's current liabilities exceed current assets because of the
continued use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Georgia Power had at March
31, 2003 approximately $13.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $1.175 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. These
credit arrangements expire in 2003 and contain provisions allowing two-year term
loans executable at the expiration date. The credit arrangements provide
liquidity support to Georgia Power's obligations with respect to variable rate
pollution control bonds and commercial paper. Due to a reduction of commercial
paper and variable rate pollution control bonds requiring liquidity support as
outlined in "Financing Activities" above, Georgia Power plans to reduce its
credit arrangements to $700 million in June 2003. Georgia Power may also meet
short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue
and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of Georgia Power and other Southern Company subsidiaries. At March
31, 2003, Georgia Power had outstanding $521 million of commercial paper and
$7.9 million of extendible commercial notes. Management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

                               GULF POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2003 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2002


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Gulf Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter
2003 was $14 million compared to $11.7 million for the corresponding period in
2002. First quarter 2003 earnings increased by $2.3 million, or 19.2%, primarily
due to higher operating revenues when compared to the same period in 2002.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                    Increase (Decrease)
                                            ----------------------------------
                                                       First Quarter
                                            ----------------------------------
                                                (in thousands)          %
Retail sales...............................      $26,299               19.7
Sales for resale - non-affiliates..........        1,291                7.4
Sales for resale - affiliates..............        7,636              295.9
Other revenues.............................        1,679               22.6
Fuel expense...............................       26,512               72.1
Purchased power - affiliates...............       (4,474)             (26.2)
Other operations expense...................        3,086               11.5
Maintenance expense........................       (1,609)              (8.8)
Depreciation and amortization..............        2,961               17.1
Taxes other than income taxes..............        1,973               13.7
Allowances for equity funds used during
  construction.............................       (2,331)             (98.2)

     Retail sales. Excluding the recovery of fuel expense and certain other
expenses that do not affect net income, retail sales increased by $13 million,
or 16.4%, for the first quarter 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002.
Energy sales to commercial and industrial customers were higher by 2.5% and
8.3%, respectively, in the first quarter 2003 as compared to the same period in
2002. However, residential energy sales were slightly down by 0.9% in the first
quarter 2003 from the first quarter of the prior year. Associated revenues for
residential, commercial and industrial customers increased by 18.4%, 18% and
29.2%, due mainly to the retail rate increase that became effective in June 2002
and growth in the number of customers served in Gulf Power's service area.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. Sales for resale to non-affiliates
increased for the first quarter 2003 when compared to the corresponding period
in 2002 mainly due to a 10% increase in energy sales to these customers. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is
usually sold at variable cost.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies and purchases of energy within the
Southern Company system will vary depending on demand and the availability and
cost of generating resources at each company. Gulf Power increased its
generating resources with commercial operation of Plant Smith in April 2002 and
thus had greater generation resources to sell to affiliates. These transactions
do not have a significant impact on earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Other revenues. During the first quarter 2003, other revenues were higher
than the same period in 2002 primarily due to an increase of $622 thousand in
miscellaneous service revenues and an increase of $752 thousand in franchise
fees resulting from the retail rate increase that became effective in June 2002.

     Fuel expense. In the first quarter 2003, fuel expense was higher than the
same period in 2002 due primarily to the commercial operation of Plant Smith
Unit 3 in April 2002 coupled with a 53.4% increase in natural gas prices as well
as increased generation to meet additional demand for energy. Since energy
expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Gulf Power's fuel cost
recovery mechanism, these expenses do not have a significant impact on net
income.

     Other operation expense. The increase in other operation expense during the
first quarter 2003 is primarily attributed to a $712 thousand increase in
customer accounts expenses and a $1,652 thousand increase in administrative and
general expenses.

     Maintenance expense. The first quarter 2003 decrease in maintenance expense
from the same period in the prior year reflects more scheduled production
maintenance performed in 2002 than in the first quarter 2003.

     Depreciation and amortization. The increase in utility plant in service
since the first quarter 2002 is the main cause of the increase in depreciation
and amortization in the first quarter 2003 as compared to the first quarter
2002.

     Taxes other than income taxes. Taxes other than income taxes increased in
the first quarter 2003 due primarily to property taxes on Plant Smith Unit 3 and
revenue taxes related to the 2002 base rate increase.

     Allowance for equity funds used construction. The decrease in this item in
the first quarter 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002 reflects the
completion of construction of Plant Smith Unit 3 in 2002.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors. The major factors include regulatory matters and the ability to achieve
energy sales growth. For additional information relating to these issues, see
Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of Gulf Power in the Form 10-K.

     Gulf Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. Gulf Power's business activities are subject to
extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment.
Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including
property damage, personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental
requirements, has increased generally throughout the United States. In
particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to
hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such
litigation currently filed against Gulf Power cannot be predicted at this time;
however after consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate
that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a
material adverse effect on Gulf Power's financial statements.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through Gulf Power's Environmental Cost Recovery
Clause. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other
environmental issues, including the EPA litigation, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial
statements of Gulf Power in the Form 10-K.

     In 2002 the Florida PSC approved an annual base rate increase for Gulf
Power of $53.2 million which became effective in June 2002. Reference is made to
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
Gulf Power in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Gulf Power in the Form 10-K for
information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice of
proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Evident in the
White Paper are continuing differences in opinion between the FERC and various
state regulatory commissions over questions of jurisdiction and protection of
retail customers. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any
impact of this proposal on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on
the form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Gulf Power's
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities could be adversely affected by
changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its regional power market.

     Reference is made to Notes (A) and (E) through (G) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential. Reference is also made to
Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Gulf Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of Gulf Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Gulf Power's only
critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. Gulf Power is subject to
the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation." In the event that a portion of Gulf Power's operations is
no longer subject to these provisions, Gulf Power would be required to write off
related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
and determine if any other assets, including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (H) to the Condensed  Financial  Statements herein for
information  regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143,  "Accounting  for
Asset  Retirement  Obligations"  effective  January 1, 2003.  Statement  No. 143
establishes  new  accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  legal  obligations
associated  with the ultimate cost of retiring  long-lived  assets.  The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred.  The cost must be  capitalized as
part of the related  long-lived  asset and  depreciated  over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Gulf Power

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


accrued for the ultimate cost of retiring most long-lived assets over the life
of the related asset through depreciation expense.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in Gulf Power's financial condition during the first three months
of 2003 included the addition of approximately $22.1 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See Gulf Power's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
herein for further details.

Credit Rating Risk

Gulf Power does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

Gulf Power's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Gulf Power is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, Gulf Power has limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Gulf Power enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale
of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent,
similar contracts for gas purchases. Gulf Power has received approval from the
Florida PSC to recover prudently incurred costs related to its fuel hedging
program through the fuel cost recovery mechanism. The fair value of derivative
energy contracts at March 31, 2003 was as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets and
liabilities. Realized gains and losses from these programs are included in fuel
expense and are recovered through Gulf Power's fuel cost recovery clause. Gains
and losses on contracts that do not represent hedges are recognized in the
income statement as incurred. At March 31, 2003, the fair value of derivative
energy contracts was reflected in the financial statements as follows:

the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and 2002.

Financing Activities

In January 2003, Gulf Power redeemed $40 million of 7.625% trust preferred
securities using the proceeds of $40 million in trust preferred securities
issued in December 2002 at a five-year initial fixed rate of 5.60%.

     In March 2003, Gulf Power issued $65 million of Series F Senior Insured
Quarterly Notes due April 1, 2033. The proceeds from this issue were used to
redeem in April 2003, the $20 million Series B 7.50% Junior Subordinated Notes
due June 30, 2037. In May 2003, the $45 million of Series E Senior Notes due
January 30, 2012 will also be redeemed.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In April 2003, Gulf Power sold through public authorities $29.075 million
of variable rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds due February 1, 2026.
The proceeds were used to redeem (1) $7.875 million aggregate principal amount
of water pollution control revenue refunding bonds, Series 1993 and (2) $21.2
million of pollution control revenue refunding bonds, Series 1996.

     Also in April 2003, Gulf Power sold through public authorities $32.55
million of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds due June 1, 2023. The
proceeds were used to redeem the outstanding amount of pollution control revenue
refunding bonds, Series 1993. Both pollution control bonds issued in April 2003
will bear interest at a rate to be determined by the auction rate process and
will not require backup bank credit facilities.

     Gulf Power plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of Gulf Power
under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Other Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of Gulf Power's
capital requirements for its construction program, maturing debt and
environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, Gulf Power
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Gulf Power had at March
31, 2003 approximately $44.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $66.3
million of unused committed lines of credit with banks that expire in 2003. The
credit arrangements provide liquidity support to Gulf Power's obligations with
respect to variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper. Gulf
Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at
the request and for the benefit of Gulf Power and other Southern Company
subsidiaries. At March 31, 2003, Gulf Power had outstanding $20 million of notes
payable and $7.9 million of commercial paper. Management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2003 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2002


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Mississippi Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first
quarter 2003 was $21.4 million, compared to $14.0 million for the corresponding
period of 2002. Earnings increased by $7.4 million, or 52.9%, in the first
quarter 2003 due primarily to higher operating revenues as compared to the same
period in 2002.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                   Increase (Decrease)
                                           -------------------------------------
                                                      First Quarter
                                           -------------------------------------
                                               (in thousands)          %
Retail sales..........................           (4,497)              (3.8)
Sales for resale - non-affiliates.....           18,273               35.0
Sales for resale - affiliates.........           (3,390)             (35.3)
Fuel expense..........................           (9,078)             (15.1)
Purchased power - non-affiliates......            3,976              140.0
Purchased power - affiliates..........           12,926              174.5
Maintenance expense...................           (6,411)             (31.0)
Depreciation and amortization.........           (1,439)              (9.9)

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue decreased by $1.4 million, or 1.9%, in the first
quarter 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002. Retail sales revenues
were lower in the first quarter 2003 primarily due to a decrease in energy sales
to residential, commercial and industrial customers of 3%, 0.3% and 5.1%,
respectively, when compared to the same period in 2002. Energy sales were lower
as a direct result of milder weather in Mississippi Power's service area and the
continued economic slowdown in Mississippi Power's service area.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. During the first quarter 2003, sales for
resale to non-affiliates were higher when compared to the same period in 2002.
This increase is primarily attributed to a 23.7% increase in wholesale prices
and, to a lesser extent, a 12.9% increase in energy sales as compared to the
same period in 2002.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the Southern Company system will vary depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. The decrease in fuel expense in the first quarter 2003
compared to the same period in 2002 is principally due to opportunities to
purchase some power more economically than to self-generate. Since energy
expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's
retail and wholesale fuel cost recovery clauses, these expenses do not have a
significant impact on earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power - non-affiliates. In the first quarter 2003, purchased
power from non-affiliates was higher when compared to the first quarter 2002
primarily because Mississippi Power had opportunities to purchase some power at
a lower cost than the cost of self-generation. Generally, these purchased power
transactions do not have a significant impact on net income since energy
expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's
retail and wholesale fuel cost recovery clauses.

     Maintenance expense. This expense was lower in the first quarter 2003 as
compared to the same period in the prior year, due to scheduled maintenance
performed at Plant Watson and Plant Daniel in the first quarter 2002.

     Depreciation and amortization. The first quarter 2003 decrease is a result
of a credit to amortization of environmental expenses recorded in early 2003
based on Mississippi Power's latest ECO Plan filing with the Mississippi PSC
when compared to the same period in 2002.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales. For additional information relating to these issues, see Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of Mississippi Power in the Form 10-K.

     Mississippi Power's business activities are subject to extensive
governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation
over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property
damage, personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements,
has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal
injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have
become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation currently filed
against Mississippi Power cannot be predicted at this time; however, after
consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the
liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material adverse
effect on Mississippi Power's financial statements.

     Mississippi Power's 2003 ECO Plan filing was approved, as filed, by the
Mississippi PSC on March 18, 2003 and resulted in a slight increase in rates.
Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot continue to be recovered. For additional information about the
Clean Air Act and other environmental issues, including the EPA litigation, see
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note
3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Mississippi Power in the Form 10-K
for information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice
of proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Evident in the

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


White Paper are continuing differences in opinion between the FERC and various
state regulatory commissions over questions of jurisdiction and protection of
retail customers. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any
impact of this proposal on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on
the form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Mississippi
Power's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities could be adversely affected
by changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its regional power
market.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policies

Mississippi Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
the financial statements of Mississippi Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.
Mississippi Power's critical accounting policies involve rate regulation and
lease accounting. Mississippi Power is subject to the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation."
In the event that a portion of Mississippi Power's operations is no longer
subject to these provisions, Mississippi Power would be required to write off
related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
and determine if any other assets, including plant, have been impaired.

     Additionally, Mississippi Power accounts for its lease agreement with
Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership ("Escatawpa"), as an operating lease.
Under this agreement, Escatawpa, a special purpose entity, is owner-lessor of
the combined-cycle generating units at Mississippi Power's Plant Daniel.
Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Accounting
Policies - Critical Policies" of Mississippi Power in the Form 10-K for
additional information regarding this lease agreement. Mississippi Power is
currently working to restructure this agreement so that it will continue to be
accounted for as an operating lease. The restructured agreement should be
completed in June 2003, prior to the required implementation date of FASB
Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Certain Special-Purpose Entities." If
the agreement is not restructured, FASB Interpretation No. 46 will require that
Mississippi Power consolidate the assets and liabilities of Escatawpa effective
July 1, 2003. Consolidation of these assets and liabilities could require
Mississippi Power to seek additional regulatory review.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (H) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Mississippi Power
accrued for the ultimate cost of retiring most long-lived assets over the life
of the related asset through depreciation expense.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in Mississippi Power's financial condition during the first three
months of 2003 included the addition of approximately $11.8 million to utility
plant. The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from cash and cash equivalents. See Mississippi Power's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows herein for further details.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In May 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of an operating
lease agreement with Escatawpa, a special purpose entity, to use a
combined-cycle generating facility located at Mississippi Power's Plant Daniel.
The facility cost approximately $370 million. The lease provides for a residual
value guarantee -- approximately 71 percent of the completion cost -- by
Mississippi Power that is due upon termination of the lease in certain
circumstances. Reference is made to Note 8 to the financial statements of
Mississippi Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K under "Lease Agreements" and to
"Critical Policies" above for additional information.

Credit Rating Risk

Mississippi Power does not have any credit agreements that would require
material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit
rating downgrade. There are certain fixed-price physical gas purchase contracts
that could require collateral -- but not accelerated payment -- in the event of
a credit rating change to below investment grade; however, at March 31, 2003,
this exposure was immaterial.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Exposure to Market Risks

Mississippi Power's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have
not changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Mississippi Power is not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, Mississippi Power has limited exposure
to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Mississippi Power enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and
sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser
extent, similar contracts for gas purchases. Mississippi Power has also
implemented retail fuel hedging programs at the instruction of its PSC and
wholesale fuel hedging programs under agreements with wholesale customers. The
fair value of derivative, fuel and energy contracts was as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to the retail and wholesale fuel hedging programs are recorded as
regulatory assets and liabilities. Realized gains and losses from these programs
are included in fuel expense and are recovered through Mississippi Power's
energy cost management clauses. Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial
statements of Mississippi Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K regarding the
respective approvals of the retail and wholesale energy cost management clauses.

derivative energy contracts reflected in the financial statements was as

     Total fair value                                $13,306
     ======================================= =========================

     For the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, amounts recognized in
income were immaterial.

     For additional information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Market Price Risk" of Mississippi Power in the Form
10-K and Note 1 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power in Item 8 of
the Form 10-K.

Financing Activities

In April 2003, Mississippi Power issued $90 million of Series E 5-5/8% Senior
Notes due May 1, 2033. The proceeds from this sale will be used to repay at
maturity $35 million of Mississippi Power's Series B 6.05% Senior Notes due May
1, 2003, to redeem the $51.55 million outstanding principal amount of
Mississippi Power's Series A 6.75% Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due June 30,
2038 and to repay a portion of Mississippi Power's outstanding short-term
indebtedness.

     Mississippi Power plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to
retire higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
Mississippi Power under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" and Note 3 to the financial statements
in the Form 10-K for a description of Mississippi Power's capital requirements
for its construction program, environmental compliance efforts and maturities of
long-term debt.


Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, Mississippi
Power plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     Mississippi Power's current liabilities exceed current assets because of
the continued use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs as
well as scheduled maturities of long-term debt.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Mississippi Power had at
March 31, 2003 approximately $13.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and
$79.5 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks that expire in
2003. Some of these credit arrangements, approximately $35 million, contain
provisions allowing two-year term loans executable at expiration date. The
credit arrangements provide liquidity support to Mississippi Power's obligations
with respect to variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper.
Mississippi Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible
commercial notes at the request and for the benefit of Mississippi Power and
other Southern Company subsidiaries. At March 31, 2003, Mississippi Power had
approximately $20 million of outstanding commercial paper. Management believes
that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of
credit without maintaining large cash balances.

                       SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2003 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2002


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Savannah Electric's net income for the first quarter 2003 was $3.5 million as
compared to $1.8 million for the corresponding period of 2002. Earnings for the
first quarter 2003 increased by $1.7 million or 94.7% due primarily to higher
operating revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                       Increase (Decrease)
                                               --------------------------------
                                                          First Quarter
                                               --------------------------------
                                                   (in thousands)          %
Retail sales..............................           $8,599               15.6
Sales for resale - non-affiliates.........            1,101              118.0
Sales for resale - affiliates.............            1,426              158.8
Fuel expense..............................            2,497               28.0
Purchased power - non-affiliates..........              945               88.6
Purchased power - affiliates..............            6,886               56.8
Maintenance expense.......................              585               11.0
Depreciation and amortization.............           (1,448)             (22.2)

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which do not affect net income,
retail sales revenue increased by $2.7 million, or 7.7%, for the first quarter
2003 when compared to the corresponding period in 2002. Energy sales to
residential and commercial customers were higher by 10.4% and 2.1%,
respectively, due mainly to colder weather and growth in the number of customers
when compared to the same period in 2002. Energy sales to industrial customers
were higher by 16.8% in the first quarter 2003 compared to the first quarter
2002 primarily due to increased usage by one industrial customer. Retail sales
revenues also reflect the base rate increase that took effect in June 2002.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. Sales for resale to non-affiliates
during the first quarter 2003 increased when compared to the same period in 2002
primarily due to increased demand for energy by non-affiliates. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is
usually sold at cost.

     Sales for resale - affiliates. Revenues from sales for resale to affiliated
companies within the Southern Company system will vary depending on demand and
the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is
sold at cost.

     Fuel expense. Fuel expense increased in the first quarter 2003 due
primarily to increased generation related to the higher demand for energy.

                       SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power - non-affiliates. The increase in purchased power from
non-affiliates is primarily due to the opportunity to purchase this energy at a
cost lower than self-generation in the first quarter 2003 as compared to the
same period in 2002. Non-affiliated transactions are primarily energy and do not
have a significant impact on earnings, as energy costs are generally recovered
through Savannah Electric's fuel cost recovery clause.

     Purchased power - affiliates. The increase in purchased power from
affiliates in the first quarter 2003 was directly related to the new PPA with
Southern Power which became effective June 2002. The annual capacity costs of
this PPA are approximately $14.0 million. Capacity costs of purchased power are
generally recovered through base rates and the energy component is recovered
through the fuel cost recovery clause. Purchased power from affiliates also
includes energy purchases which will vary depending on demand and cost of
generation resources at each company. These energy costs are recovered through
the fuel cost recovery clause and have no significant impact on earnings.

     Maintenance expense. Maintenance expense in the first quarter 2003
increased when compared to the same period in the prior year due primarily to
scheduled maintenance on steam generating facilities.

     Depreciation and amortization. The decrease in this item during the first
quarter 2003 is primarily due to discontinued accelerated depreciation and the
amortization of the related regulatory liability that began in June 2002, in
accordance with the 2002 base rate order.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors which include maintaining a stable regulatory environment and achieving
energy sales growth while containing costs. For additional information relating
to these issues, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Risks Factors" and
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
Savannah Electric in the Form 10-K.

     Savannah Electric's business activities are subject to extensive
governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation
over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property
damage, personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements,
has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal
injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have
become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation currently filed
against Savannah Electric cannot be predicted at this time; after consultation
with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any,
arising from such proceedings would have a material adverse effect on Savannah
Electric's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For additional
information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental issues, including
the EPA litigation, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of Savannah
Electric in the Form 10-K.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Savannah Electric in the Form 10-K
for information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice
of proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Evident in the
White Paper are continuing differences in opinion between the FERC and various
state regulatory commissions over questions of jurisdiction and protection of
retail customers. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any
impact of this proposal on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on
the form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Savannah
Electric's revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities could be adversely
affected by changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its regional
power market.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of Savannah Electric in the Form 10-K for
information on plans to retire a 102 megawatt peaking facility in May 2005 and a
fifteen-year PPA with Southern Power to purchase 200 megawatts of capacity
beginning in June 2005 from the planned combined-cycle plant at Plant McIntosh
to be built and owned by Southern Power. The annual capacity cost is expected to
be approximately $14.5 million. Reference is made to Note (L) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for information regarding the FERC approval process
for this PPA.

     Reference is made to Notes (A), (E), (F) and (L) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for discussion of various contingencies and other matters
which may affect future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Savannah Electric's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
the financial statements of Savannah Electric in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.
Savannah Electric's only critical accounting policy involves rate regulation.
Savannah Electric is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,
"Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a
portion of Savannah Electric's operations is no longer subject to these
provisions, Savannah Electric would be required to write off related regulatory
assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable and determine if
any other assets have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (H) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Savannah Electric
accrued for the ultimate cost of retiring most long-lived assets over the life
of the related asset through depreciation expense.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in Savannah Electric's financial condition during the first three
months of 2003 included the addition of approximately $10.8 million to utility
plant. The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations and the issuance of securities. See Savannah
Electric's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows herein for further details.

Credit Rating Risk

Savannah Electric does not have any credit agreements that would require
material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit
rating downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

Savannah Electric's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have
not changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Savannah Electric is not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, Savannah Electric has limited exposure
to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Savannah Electric enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and
sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser
extent, similar contracts for gas purchases. Savannah Electric has also
implemented a retail fuel hedging program at the instruction of its PSC. The
fair value of derivative energy contracts at March 31, 2003 was as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to the retail fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets
and liabilities. At March 31, 2003, Savannah Electric had approximately $1.3
million in regulatory liabilities related to unrealized gains on mark to market
derivative contracts associated with its fuel hedging programs. Realized gains
and losses from these programs are included in fuel expense and are recovered
through Savannah Electric's fuel cost recovery clause. Gains and losses on
contracts that do not represent hedges are recognized in the Statements of
Income as incurred. For the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, these
amounts were not material.

     For additional information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Exposure to Market Risks" of Savannah Electric in the
Form 10-K and Note 1 to the financial statements of Savannah Electric in Item 8
of the Form 10-K.

Financing Activities

In February 2003, Savannah Electric sold through public authorities an aggregate
principal amount of $13.87 million of variable rate Pollution Control Revenue
Bonds, Series 2003 due February 1, 2038. The proceeds from this sale, together
with any investment proceeds and other moneys of Savannah Electric, were used to
redeem $13.87 million aggregate principal amount of Development Authority of
Effingham County Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, Series 1997. The 2003 bonds
will bear interest at a rate to be determined by the auction rate process.
Unlike the redeemed bonds, the 2003 bonds will not require backup bank credit
facilities.

     Savannah Electric plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to
retire higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of Savannah
Electric under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Other Capital
Requirements" and "Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of
Savannah Electric's capital requirements for its construction program, maturing
debt and environmental compliance efforts.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



Sources of Capital

Savannah Electric plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of
adequate earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other
factors. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for
additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Savannah Electric had at
March 31, 2003 approximately $1.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $55
million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks, of which $40 million
expires in 2003 and $15 million expires in 2004 and beyond. The credit
arrangements provide liquidity support to some of Savannah Electric's
obligations with respect to its variable rate debt and its commercial paper.
Savannah Electric may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible
commercial notes at the request and for the benefit of Savannah Electric and
other Southern Company subsidiaries. At March 31, 2003, Savannah Electric had no
outstanding notes payable or commercial paper. Since Savannah Electric has no
major generating plants under construction, management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2003 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2002


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Southern Power's net income for first quarter 2003 was $23.1 million compared to
$4.4 million for the corresponding period of 2002. The increase in earnings of
$18.7 million is primarily due to the sale of wholesale capacity and energy to
affiliated and non-affiliated companies. The majority of this income is
attributed to the commercial operation of Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 and Plant
Franklin Unit 1 beginning in June 2002 along with the initiation of PPAs for
those units with Georgia Power and Savannah Electric. During the first quarter
2002, Southern Power had only one plant (Plant Dahlberg) in commercial
operation.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                      Increase (Decrease)

N/M  Not meaningful.

     Sales for resale to non-affiliates. During the first quarter 2003, these
sales were higher as a result of wholesale capacity and energy sales to
non-affiliates that increased with commercial operation of Plant Franklin Unit 1
and Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7, as well as additional available capacity
arising from new units not yet in commercial operation. The additional
generation provided by the new units that was not required by Georgia Power and
Savannah Electric under long-term PPAs was available for sales to
non-affiliates. The colder than normal weather experienced early in the first
quarter of 2003 contributed to increased demand throughout the Super Southeast.

     Sales for resale to affiliates. Energy and capacity sales through the new
PPAs with Georgia Power and Savannah Electric accounted for most of this
increase from first quarter 2002. Revenues from sales to affiliated companies
through the Southern Company system power pool ("Southern Pool") that are not
covered by PPAs and energy sales under PPAs will vary depending on demand and
the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the
Southern Pool. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings,
since the energy is generally sold at variable cost.

                             SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel expense. This increase during the first quarter 2003 is mainly
associated with commercial operation of units at Plant Wansley and Plant
Franklin in June 2002 as compared to the first quarter of 2002, when Southern
Power had only Plant Dahlberg in commercial operation. Plant Dahlberg is
primarily utilized for peak-load conditions, which primarily occur during the
summer months.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. Purchased power from non-affiliates
increased in the first quarter 2003 to serve the increased requirements under
new PPAs with power purchased at prices lower than Southern Power's
self-generation.

     Purchased power from affiliates. During the first quarter 2003, Southern
Power purchased more power from affiliates mainly due to the availability of
power at prices lower than Southern Power's self-generation. Expenses from
purchased power transactions will vary depending on demand, availability and the
cost of generating resources accessible throughout the Southern Company system.

     Other operation expense. The first quarter 2003 increase in other operation
expense is related to production expenses and administrative and general
expenses resulting from the commercial operation in June 2002 of Plant Wansley
Units 6 and 7 and Plant Franklin Unit 1 when compared to the same period in the
prior year.

     Maintenance expense. The increase in the first quarter 2003 is attributed
to commercial operation of Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 and Plant Franklin Unit 1
in June 2002.

     Depreciation and amortization. The additional generating units placed into
service in June 2002 are the cause of the increase in depreciation and
amortization during the first quarter 2003 when compared to the corresponding
period in 2002.

     Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. The increase in interest
expense, net of amounts capitalized during the first quarter 2003 from the same
period in 2002 is primarily related to a decline in the percentage of total
interest expense being capitalized as Southern Power has shifted from
construction mode into construction and operation mode.

     Other income (expense), net. This increase in other income (expense), net
for the first quarter 2003 is attributed to gains on derivative energy
contracts. See "Exposure to Market Risks" below for more information related to
these contracts.

Effects of Inflation

Southern Power is subject to long-term contracts and income tax laws that are
based on the recovery of historical costs. While the inflation rate has been
relatively low in recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on
Southern Power because of the large investment in generating facilities with
long economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not
recognize this economic loss nor the partially offsetting gain that arises
through financing facilities with fixed-money obligations such as long-term
debt.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future earnings. The
level of future earnings depends on numerous factors including completion of
construction on new generating facilities, regulatory matters, energy sales,
creditworthiness of customers, total generating capacity available in the Super
Southeast and the remarketing of capacity. For additional information relating
to these issues, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of Southern
Power in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - General" and to Note 5 to the financial statements
of Southern Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information on
long-term power sales agreements and PPAs. Southern Power's PPAs with
non-affiliated counterparties have provisions that require the posting of
collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee in the event that S&P or
Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of such counterparty to below-investment
grade, or, if the counterparty is not rated, fails to maintain a minimum
coverage ratio. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable
source of revenue during their respective terms.

     In 2003, Southern Power expects Plant Franklin Unit 2, Plant Harris Units 1
and 2 and Plant Stanton A to be completed and placed into commercial operation.
In 2004, Southern Power's PPA with Georgia Power will begin for Plant Harris
Unit 2. PPAs for the other units become effective upon commercial operation.
Southern Power also has Plant Franklin Unit 3 and Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11
under construction. Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for information regarding the proposed termination of Southern
Power's PPAs with Dynegy. Because of the proposed termination of these PPAs,
Southern Power is exploring several options for its existing capacity and is
also evaluating its construction schedule for Plant Franklin Unit 3 and may
determine to defer or cancel further construction based on forecasted capacity
needs. Reference is also made to Note (L) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for information regarding the FERC approval process for Southern Power's
PPAs with Georgia Power and Savannah Electric for Plant McIntosh Units 10 and
11. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of Southern Power in the Form 10-K for information on
the development by federal and state environmental regulatory agencies of
additional control strategies for emission of air pollution from all major
sources of air pollution, particularly electric generating facilities.
Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws and
regulations could affect earnings if such costs are not fully recovered.

     Southern Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has
increased generally throughout the United States; in particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Southern Power in the Form 10-K
for information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice
of proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Evident in the
White Paper are continuing differences in opinion between the FERC and various
state regulatory commissions over questions of jurisdiction and protection of
retail customers. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any
impact of this proposal on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on
the form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted.

     Reference is also made to Notes (A), (E) and (I) through (L) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policies

Southern Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of Southern Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Southern
Power has three critical accounting policies that require a significant amount
of judgment and are considered to be the most important to the presentation of
Southern Power's financial position and results of operations. The first
critical policy is the recognition of capacity revenues from long-term contracts
at the lesser of the levelized basis or the cash collected over the contract
periods. Second, Southern Power designates qualifying derivative instruments as
cash flow or fair value hedges and marks such derivative instruments to market
based primarily on quoted market prices. The unrealized changes in fair value of
qualifying cash flow hedges are deferred in other comprehensive income. Any
ineffectiveness in those hedges and changes in non-qualifying positions are
reported as a component of current period income. Finally, Southern Power uses
flow-through accounting for state manufacturer's tax credits. This means that
Southern Power recognizes the credit as a reduction of tax expense when it is
more likely than not to be allowed by the Georgia Department of Revenue.

New Accounting Standards

     Reference is made to Note (H) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Southern Power has
no liability for asset retirement obligations. Upon adoption, Southern Power
recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $0.6 million,
representing previously accrued removal costs.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in Southern Power's financial condition during the first three
months of 2003 was the addition of approximately $104 million to utility plant
related to on-going construction of Southern Power's combined-cycle units. The
funds for these additions were provided by Southern Power's credit facility,
commercial paper program and subordinated loans from Southern Company. See
Southern Power's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows herein for further details.

Credit Rating Risk

Southern Power does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade. There are certain physical electricity sale contracts, fixed-price
physical gas purchases and agreements covering interest rate swaps and currency
swaps that could require collateral -- but not accelerated payment -- in the
event of a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral
may be provided for by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit or cash. At
March 31, 2003, the maximum potential collateral requirements under the
electricity sale contracts and financial instrument agreements were
approximately $197 million. At March 31, 2003, there were no material collateral
requirements for the gas purchase contracts.

Exposure to Market Risks

Southern Power is exposed to market risks,  including changes in interest rates,
currency  exchange rates and certain  commodity prices. To manage the volatility
attributable  to these  exposures,  Southern  Power  nets the  exposure  to take
advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for
the remaining  exposure  pursuant to approved risk management  policies in areas
such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices.  Southern Power's policy is
that  derivatives  are to be used  primarily  for hedging  purposes.  Derivative
positions are  monitored  using  techniques  that include  market  valuation and
sensitivity analysis.

     Southern Power has no outstanding variable rate long-term debt. To mitigate
Southern Power's exposure to interest rates, it has entered into interest rate
swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of 2003 planned debt issuances.
Changes in the fair values of these swaps are deferred in Other Comprehensive
Income. The swaps will settle upon the issuance of the debt and will be
amortized to expense over the appropriate periods. (See Note (I) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information.) Based on
Southern Power's overall interest rate exposure at March 31, 2003, including
derivative and other interest-rate sensitive instruments, a near-term 100
basis-point change in interest rates would not materially affect Southern
Power's financial statements. In addition, Southern Power is not aware of any
facts or circumstances that would significantly affect such exposures in the
near term.

                             SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Because energy from Southern Power's facilities is primarily sold under
long-term contracts with tolling agreements and provisions shifting
substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the PPA counterparties,
Southern Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and
prices of electricity is limited. To mitigate residual risks in those areas,
Southern Power enters into fixed-price contracts for the purchase or sale of
fuel and electricity. In connection with the transfers of Plant Franklin in 2001
and Plant Wansley in 2002 to Southern Power, Georgia Power transferred
approximately $5.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, in derivative assets
relating to electric and gas forward contracts in effect at the date of the
transfers. These contracts were recorded at fair value on the date of the
transfer, which was equal to Georgia Power's carrying amount. Following the
transfer, these contracts are marked to market through income until realized and
settled.

     Southern Power has firm purchase commitments that require payment in Euros.
As a hedge against fluctuations in the exchange rate for Euros, Southern Power
entered into forward contracts to purchase Euros and has designated these
contracts as fair value hedges of an unrecognized firm commitment. Since the
terms of these Euro contracts mirror the purchase commitment terms, there is no
ineffectiveness recognized in income. At March 31, 2003, Southern Power had
outstanding contracts covering a notional amount of $1.6 million in commitments
through May 2003.

     Unrealized gains and losses on electric and gas contracts used to hedge
anticipated purchases and sales are deferred in Other Comprehensive Income.
Gains and losses on contracts that do not represent hedges are recognized in the
Statements of Income as incurred. The fair values of derivative energy contracts
at March 31, 2003 were as follows:

                                                   First Quarter

     --------------------------------------- -------------------------
                                                  Fair Value

     Contracts beginning of period                    $3,864
     Contracts realized or settled                      (665)

     Current period changes                           (1,324)
     --------------------------------------- -------------------------
     Contracts at March 31, 2003                      $1,875
     ======================================= =========================

     At March 31, 2003, all of these contracts are based on actively quoted
market prices. Realized gains and losses on hedged transactions are recognized
in revenues and/or fuel expense in the Statements of Income as incurred. For the
three month periods ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately $0.3 million of
gains and $1.3 million of losses, respectively, were recognized in Other Income
in the Statements of Income.

                             SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Financing Activities

During the first three months of 2003, Southern Company made subordinated loans
to Southern Power of approximately $12 million. In March 2003, $190 million of
notes payable to Southern Company were converted to a capital contribution from
Southern Company. Equity contributions and subordinated loans from Southern
Company are projected to total approximately $813 million to Southern Power by
the end of 2003. No dividends are projected to be paid in 2003. These
projections are contingent upon FERC approval of the Plant McIntosh PPAs.
Reference is also made to Note (L) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding the FERC approval process for Southern Power's PPAs
with Georgia Power and Savannah Electric for Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11.


Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements for Construction" and "Other Capital Requirements" of Southern
Power in the Form 10-K for a description of Southern Power's capital
requirements for its construction program, maturing debt, purchase commitments
and long-term service agreements.

Sources of Capital

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Southern Power had at March 31,
2003 approximately $2.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. To meet liquidity
and capital resource requirements, Southern Power had at March 31, 2003
approximately $850 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks
expiring in 2004. Effective April 2003, the credit facility for Southern Power
was reduced to $650 million to reflect lower short-term borrowing needs. The
facility was extended to April 2006. This line also provides liquidity support
for Southern Power's commercial paper program (as discussed below). Amounts
drawn under the arrangements are used to finance acquisition and construction
costs related to gas-fired electric generating facilities and for general
corporate purposes, subject to borrowing limitations for each generating
facility. The arrangements permit Southern Power to fund construction of future
generating facilities upon meeting certain requirements.

     Southern Power's current liabilities exceed current assets because of the
continued use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs.

     In February 2003, Southern Power initiated a commercial paper program to
fund a portion of the construction costs of new generating facilities. Southern
Power's strategy is to refinance most of such short-term borrowings with
long-term securities following commercial operation. The amount of commercial
paper will initially represent about 45% of total debt, but is forecasted to
decline to about 7% at year-end 2005 as more construction projects are completed
and refinanced with long-term securities. At March 31, 2003, Southern Power had
outstanding $446.5 million in commercial paper. Reference is made to Note 7 to
the financial statements of Southern Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for
additional information relating to the commercial paper program.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:


(A)  The condensed financial  statements of the registrants included herein have
     been prepared by each registrant,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and
     regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of each registrant's management, the
     information   regarding  such  registrant  furnished  herein  reflects  all
     adjustments  necessary to present  fairly the results of operations for the
     periods  ended March 31, 2003 and 2002.  Certain  information  and footnote
     disclosures   normally  included  in  financial   statements   prepared  in
     accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United
     States  have  been  condensed  or  omitted   pursuant  to  such  rules  and
     regulations,   although  each  registrant  believes  that  the  disclosures
     regarding such  registrant are adequate to make the  information  presented
     not  misleading.   Disclosure  which  would  substantially   duplicate  the
     disclosure   in  the  Form  10-K  and   details   which  have  not  changed
     significantly  in amount or  composition  since the filing of the Form 10-K
     are omitted  from this Form 10-Q.  Therefore,  it is  suggested  that these
     condensed  financial  statements be read in conjunction  with the financial
     statements and the notes thereto  included in the Form 10-K.  Certain prior
     period  amounts  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  current  period
     presentation.  Due  to  seasonal  variations  in  the  demand  for  energy,
     operating  results for the periods  presented do not  necessarily  indicate
     operating results for the entire year.

(B)  Reference is made to Note 11 to the financial statements of Southern
     Company in Item 8 and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
     Earnings Potential - General" of Southern Company in Item 7 of the Form
     10-K for information on the spin off of Mirant from Southern Company.

     On April 30, 2003, Mirant filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
     year ended December 31, 2002. This filing included Mirant's restated
     financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.
     Mirant's restated net income for 2001 and 2000 decreased by $159
     million and $29 million, respectively. Mirant also announced that it is
     preparing revised quarterly financial statements for 2001 and expects
     to provide the quarterly results as soon as possible. Southern Company
     owned 100% of Mirant through September 2000 and 80% between October
     2000 and April 2, 2001. Due to Southern Company's spin-off of Mirant on
     April 2, 2001, Southern Company's financial statements reflect its
     share of Mirant's net income as discontinued operations. The effect of
     these restatements on Southern Company's financial statements, if any,
     cannot be determined until Mirant's 2001 revised quarterly financial
     statements are filed.

(C)  Reference is made to Note 1 "Leveraged Leases" and Note 6 to the
     financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 and MANAGEMENT'S
     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential - General" in Item
     7 of the Form 10-K.

     As a large corporate taxpayer, Southern Company undergoes audits by the
     IRS for each of its tax years. The IRS has completed its audits of
     Southern Company's consolidated federal income tax returns for all
     years through 1999. As part of the audit for the 1996-1999 tax years,
     the IRS reviewed Southern Company's four international leveraged lease
     transactions. Based on its review, the IRS proposed to

                                       95
<PAGE>


NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         disallow the tax losses associated with one of these transactions,
         resulting in an additional tax payment of approximately $30 million,
         including interest, to the IRS. To finalize the audit and eliminate any
         additional interest charges, Southern Company made this payment to the
         IRS in May 2003 and intends to pursue a refund claim for this amount.
         Notwithstanding the position taken by the IRS, Southern Company
         continues to believe that the transaction remains a valid lease for
         U.S. tax purposes and, accordingly, will vigorously contest the
         proposed disallowance. Southern Company has accounted for the payment
         as a deposit.

         If Southern Company is not successful in its defense of the tax
         treatment for this transaction, it would also affect the timing of the
         related revenue recognition for book purposes. A cumulative effect
         adjustment would be required to reduce net income based on the revised
         cash flows as a result of the changes in the allowed tax deductions.

         The IRS did not disallow any tax losses or make any other adjustments
         for the 1996-1999 period with respect to any of Southern Company's
         other lease transactions. However, there can be no assurance that
         subsequent IRS audits would not raise similar disallowance issues.

         The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

(D)      Reference is made to Note 9 under "Guarantees" to the financial
         statements of Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for
         information regarding Southern Company's guarantees of contractual
         commitments made by Mirant's trading and marketing subsidiaries. At
         March 31, 2003, the total notional amount of guarantees was $29
         million, all of which will expire by 2007. The estimated fair value of
         net contractual commitments outstanding was approximately $16.4 million
         at March 31, 2003. Southern Company's potential exposure under these
         contractual commitments is not expected to materially differ from the
         estimated fair value.

(E)      Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern
         Company, the operating companies and Southern Power in Item 8 and to
         "Legal Proceedings" in Item 3 of the Form 10-K for information relating
         to various lawsuits.

         On April 17, 2003, a retired employee of Mirant filed a complaint in
         the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
         alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and
         naming as defendants Mirant, Southern Company, several current and
         former directors and officers of Mirant and/or Southern Company, and
         "Unknown Fiduciary Defendants 1-100." The plaintiff seeks to represent
         a purported class consisting of individuals who were participants in or
         beneficiaries of two Mirant employee plans and their predecessor plans
         (the "Plans") at any time between January 1, 2000 and the filing of the
         complaint whose plan accounts included investments in Mirant common
         stock or the "Mirant Corporation Stock Fund." The complaint alleges
         that the defendants misled participants in the Plans by concealing
         Mirant's alleged "participation in the illegal manipulation of energy
         prices in California during 2000 and 2001 as well as other irregular
         and unlawful accounting manipulations tied to energy trading." The
         complaint does not contain any specific allegations of wrongdoing with
         respect to Southern Company. Southern Company denies any wrongdoing and
         intends vigorously to defend this action. The final outcome of this
         matter cannot now be determined.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


     Reference is made to Note 3 under "Race Discrimination Litigation" of
     Southern Company and Georgia Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. On March
     31, 2003, the United States District Court for the Northern District of
     Georgia granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all
     claims raised by all seven of the named plaintiffs. On April 28, 2003,
     plaintiffs filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for
     the Eleventh Circuit challenging these adverse summary judgment
     rulings, as well as the court's October 2001 ruling denying class
     certification. In addition, plaintiffs appealed some adverse rulings on
     discovery issues. The court has not yet set a briefing schedule on the
     appeal. The final outcome of the case cannot now be determined.

(F)  Reference is made to Note 1 under "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities"
     to the financial statements of Southern Company and each of the
     operating companies in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. The operating companies
     are subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for
     the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a
     portion of a company's operations is no longer subject to these
     provisions, the company would be required to write off related
     regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
     and determine if any other assets have been impaired.

(G)  Reference is made to Note 9, Note 4 and Note 4 under "Guarantees" to
     the financial statements of Southern Company, Georgia Power and Gulf
     Power, respectively, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information
     regarding guarantees of loans to residential customers for heat pump
     purchases. As of March 31, 2003, the total outstanding loans guaranteed
     by all of the operating companies were $16.1 million, of which Georgia
     Power is responsible for $13.0 million and Gulf Power is responsible
     for $1.0 million. Total loan loss reserves of $3.6 million ($2.8
     million for Georgia Power and $0.2 million for Gulf Power) have been
     recorded.

(H)  Effective January 1, 2003, Southern Company adopted FASB Statement No. 143,
     "Accounting   for  Asset   Retirement   Obligations".   Statement  No.  143
     establishes  new accounting and reporting  standards for legal  obligations
     associated  with the  ultimate  cost of  retiring  long-lived  assets.  The
     ultimate  costs for an asset's  future  retirement  must be recorded in the
     period in which the liability is incurred.  The cost must be capitalized as
     part of the  related  long-lived  asset and  depreciated  over the  asset's
     useful life. Additionally,  Statement No. 143 does not permit the continued
     accrual  of  future  retirement  costs for  long-lived  assets in which the
     company does not have a legal obligation to retire.  However, the operating
     companies have discussed the financial  statement  impacts of Statement No.
     143  with  their  respective  PSCs  and  will  continue  to  recognize  the
     accumulated  removal costs for other obligations as part of the accumulated
     depreciation  and  amortization  reserve.  As of March  31,  2003,  amounts
     recorded in Accumulated  Depreciation that represent regulatory liabilities
     related to such  removal  costs  totaled $1.2  billion  consisting  of $554
     million,  $417  million,  $144  million,  $73  million  and $33 million for
     Alabama Power,  Georgia Power,  Gulf Power,  Mississippi Power and Savannah
     Electric, respectively.

     The operating companies had no cumulative effect to net income
     resulting from the adoption of Statement No. 143. As a result, Alabama
     Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah
     Electric recorded regulatory assets (liabilities) of $(71) million, $21
     million, $0.9 million, $0.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively, as
     of January 1, 2003. At March 31, 2003, the regulatory liability for
     Alabama Power is reflected in the balance sheets under "Asset
     retirement obligation regulatory liability." The regulatory assets of
     the other operating companies are reflected in the balance sheets under
     either "Asset retirement obligation regulatory asset" or in "Other"
     under "Deferred Charges and Other Assets." Southern Power recorded a
     cumulative effect adjustment to income upon adoption of $0.6 million,
     representing removal costs previously accrued.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates
         to Southern Company's nuclear facilities, which include Alabama Power's
         Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plants Hatch
         and Vogtle. The fair value of assets legally restricted for settling
         retirement obligations related to these assets is $300 million, $355
         million and $655 million for Alabama Power, Georgia Power and Southern
         Company, respectively. In addition, the operating companies have
         retirement obligations related to various landfill sites, ash ponds and
         underground storage tanks. The operating companies have also identified
         retirement obligations related to certain transmission and distribution
         facilities. However, liabilities for the removal of these transmission
         and distribution assets will not be recorded because no reasonable
         estimate can be made regarding the timing of the obligations. The
         operating companies will continue to recognize in the income statement
         their ultimate removal costs in accordance with each company's
         respective regulatory treatment. Any difference between costs
         recognized under Statement No. 143 and those reflected in rates will be
         recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability.

         The following table reflects the details of the Asset Retirement
                Obligations included in the balance sheets.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(I)      In addition to the fixed price electric and gas contracts used to
         mitigate exposure to volatile energy prices (see "Exposure to Market
         Risks" in MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS herein), Southern
         Company and certain of its subsidiaries enter into interest rate swaps
         to hedge exposure to interest rate changes. Swaps related to fixed rate
         securities are accounted for as fair value hedges; swaps related to
         variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for
         as cash flow hedges. The swaps are generally structured to mirror the
         terms of the hedged debt instruments; therefore, no material
         ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings. As of March 31, 2003,
         the following swaps were outstanding:

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         On April 21, 2003, Mississippi Power and Southern Power entered into a
         letter agreement with Dynegy (the "Letter Agreement") to resolve all
         outstanding matters related to Dynegy and the PPAs. Under the terms of
         the Letter Agreement, (1) Dynegy would make a one-time cash payment of
         $75 million to Mississippi Power and $80 million to Southern Power upon
         the execution of a definitive agreement and related documentation (the
         "Closing"); (2) the PPAs between Southern Power and Dynegy relating to
         Plant Dahlberg and Plant Franklin would be terminated upon the Closing,
         with no party to have any remaining obligations under such PPAs after
         the Closing; (3) at the Closing, Dynegy and Mississippi Power would
         amend the PPA relating to Plant Daniel so that the capacity payments
         due from Dynegy to Mississippi Power would be reduced to zero for each
         month from June 2003 through October 2003 (but other obligations and
         payments by Dynegy under such PPA would not be affected during such
         time) and such PPA would terminate effective October 31, 2003, with
         neither party having any remaining obligations under such PPA after
         October 31, 2003; and (4) at the Closing, upon receipt of the cash
         payment from Dynegy, Southern Power would return the existing letters
         of credit in favor of Southern Power in support of Dynegy's obligations
         under the PPAs relating to Plant Dahlberg and Plant Franklin. The
         parties have also agreed that a letter of credit in support of Dynegy's
         continuing obligations under the PPA related to Plant Daniel would be
         maintained for any amounts owed by Dynegy to Mississippi Power under
         the PPA related to Plant Daniel. Mississippi Power, Southern Power and
         Dynegy agreed to use their best efforts to complete and execute
         definitive documentation reflecting the terms of the Letter Agreement
         by May 30, 2003.

         The termination payments from Dynegy would result in a one-time gain
         upon the Closing to Southern Company of approximately $88 million after
         tax ($38 million for Mississippi Power and $50 million for Southern
         Power). Additionally, Mississippi Power would recognize capacity
         revenues totaling approximately $8.8 million for the period from June
         through October. Under the original terms of the PPAs, Mississippi
         Power and Southern Power would have recognized revenue of approximately
         $1.8 million and $5.9 million, respectively, for the remaining period
         of 2003 following the proposed terminations.

         Because of the proposed termination of these PPAs, Mississippi Power
         and Southern Power are exploring several options for their existing
         capacity and Southern Power is evaluating its construction schedule for
         Plant Franklin Unit 3 and may determine to defer or cancel further
         construction based on forecasted capacity needs.

         The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

(K)      Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements under
         "Construction Program" of Southern Power and to Note 4 to the financial
         statements under "Construction Program" of Georgia Power in Item 8 of
         the Form 10-K for information regarding Southern Company keep-wells
         covering the transfer of specific vendor contracts from Georgia Power
         to Southern Power for the operation of Plant Dahlberg and construction
         at the Plant Franklin and Plant Stanton sites. As of March 31, 2003,
         Southern Power has no remaining purchase obligations to equipment
         vendors under these contracts.

     Savannah Electric for Plant McIntosh capacity.  Such PPAs were certified by
     the Georgia PSC in December 2002. In April 2003, Southern Power applied for
     FERC  approval of these PPAs.  The Electric  Power Supply  Association  and
     Calpine  Corporation  have made filings in this proceeding in opposition to
     the FERC's  acceptance of the PPAs,  alleging that the PPAs do not meet the
     applicable  standards for PPAs between affiliates.  Management believes the
     allegations are  without merit and that the  PPAs should be approved by the

     of settlement with the FERC. The proposed settlement, which is pending
     approval by the FERC, would have no material impact on Mississippi
     Power's financial statements; however, the ultimate outcome of this
     matter cannot now be determined.

         provided by law, all or any number of the unissued shares of preferred
         stock authorized at the time of the adoption of the joint agreement
         between Alabama Power Company and Birmingham Electric Company
         prescribing the terms and conditions of the merger of Birmingham
         Electric Company into and with Alabama Power Company) and to fix and
         determine the following relative rights and preferences of any such
         series of preferred stock and Class A preferred stock, and the number
         of shares constituting any such series and the designation thereof, or
         any of them: (1) dividend rate, (2) the dividend payment dates, (3) the
         redemption price thereof, (4) the amount payable in event of
         liquidation, voluntary and involuntary and (5) the sinking fund
         provisions, if any, for the redemption or purchase of shares; and to
         increase or decrease the number of shares of any such series subsequent
         to the issue of shares of that series, but not below the number of
         shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of
         any series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease
         shall assume the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred
         stock or Class A preferred stock, as the case may be. The board of
         directors may issue and sell such shares of preferred stock and Class A
         preferred stock in series and any other authorized shares provided for
         in this Article IX. Upon the issuance of shares of Class A preferred
         stock, there shall be transferred to stated capital represented by each
         such share of Class A preferred stock an amount equal to the excess of
         the consideration received over the par value thereof (up to an amount
         which, when added to such par value, shall not exceed such share's
         preferential claim in the event of involuntary liquidation) and the
         stated capital represented by each share so determined shall be equal
         to such share's preferential claim in the event of involuntary
         liquidation."

         THIRD: The proposed amendment to the general provisions of capital
stock require the affirmative vote of the holders of the larger amount in total
value of all of the capital stock of the Company. The Company considers that the
favorable vote of the holders of all of the outstanding common stock will be
sufficient for the adoption of such amendment.

         FOURTH: At the close of business on March 10, 2003, the record date,
the Company had 6,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, 475,115
shares of preferred stock, par value $100 per share, issued and outstanding and
8,001,250 shares of Class A preferred stock, par value $1 per share, issued and
outstanding. All of the 6,000,000 shares of common stock voted affirmatively for
the adoption of the amendment. Of the total shares of preferred stock issued and
outstanding, no shares voted affirmatively for the adoption of the amendment, no
shares voted against the amendment and no shares abstained, and of the total
shares of Class A preferred stock issued and outstanding, no shares voted
affirmatively for the adoption of the amendment, no shares voted against the
amendment and no shares abstained, such affirmative votes being sufficient for
the adoption of the foregoing amendment.

employee; whether by reason of resignation, retirement or other cause. Any

elected a director, whichever event first occurs. The application to an
individual of any provision of this paragraph may be waived by the board of
directors. Any such waiver shall only be effective on a year to year basis.

                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

                                Regular Meetings

in office.

                                     Quorum

       Section 5. At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the
directors in office shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided in Section 15 of this
Article IV, and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at
which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as
may be otherwise specifically permitted or provided by statute or by the Charter
or by these by-laws. A director is, unless established to the contrary, presumed
present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting at which he has
been present for any purpose. A director who is present at a meeting of the
board or any committee of the board when corporate action is taken is deemed to
assent to the action taken place unless (i) he objects at the beginning of the
meeting (or promptly upon arrival) to holding it or transacting business at the
meeting or, as to a matter required under the Charter or these by-laws to be
included in the notice of the purpose of the meeting, he objects before action
is taken on the matter; (ii) his dissent or abstention from action taken is
entered in the minutes of the meeting; or (iii) he delivers written notice of
his dissent or abstention to the presiding officer of the meeting before its
adjournment or to the corporation immediately after adjournment of the meeting.
The right of dissent or abstention is not available to a director who votes in
favor of the action taken.

If at any meeting of the board there shall be less than a quorum present, a
majority of those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a
quorum is obtained and no further notice thereof need be given other than by
announcement at the meeting which shall be so adjourned.

                      Meetings by Conference Telephone, etc

       Section 6. Meetings of the board of directors and of any committee
thereof may be held by means of a conference telephone or other communication by
which all directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the
meeting. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at any
such meeting.

                            Action Without a Meeting

       Section 7. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of
the board of directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a
meeting, if the action is taken by all members of the board and evidenced by one
or more consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed
by each member of the board or committee, as the case may be, and included in
the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken.
Action taken is effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the
consent specifies a different effective date. Such consent shall have the same
effect as a unanimous vote.

       Section 8. In addition to the powers and authority by these by-laws
expressly conferred on it, the board may exercise all such powers of the
corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by

the stockholders.

(c) To sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of any property of the corporation
less than all, for such price or consideration, and generally on such terms and

         Section 14. A director's conflicting interest transaction may not be
enjoined, set aside, or give rise to an award of damages or other sanctions, in
a proceeding by a stockholder or by or in the right of the corporation, because
the director, or any person with whom or which he or she has a personal,
economic, or other association, has an interest in the transaction, if:

         (1) Director's action respecting the transaction was at any time taken
         in compliance with Section 10-2B-8.62 of the Alabama Code; or

         (2) Stockholders' action respecting the transaction was at any time
         taken in compliance with Section 10-2B-8.63 of the Alabama Code; or

         (3) The transaction, judged according to the circumstances at the time
         of commitment, is established to have been fair to the corporation.

                                    Vacancies

       Section 15. If a vacancy occurs on the board: (i) the board of directors
may fill the vacancy, except that the directors shall not have the power to fill
a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors or (ii) if the
directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the board, they
may fill the vacancy, if it is one that the directors are authorized to fill, by
the affirmative vote of a majority of all the directors remaining in office. A

registered only by the person named in the certificate, or by attorney lawfully
constituted in writing, upon surrender of such certificate and payment of all
taxes; and the corporation shall keep in the hands of an agent or other person
designated for that purpose a true statement or book showing who are the holders
of the stock of the corporation and all transfers and hypothecations thereof;

agents or transfer clerks and registrars, and may require all stock certificates

       Section 3. For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice
of a stockholders' meeting, to demand a special meeting, to vote, or to take any
other action, the board of directors of the corporation may fix the record date
but not to exceed, in any case, seventy (70) days before the meeting or action
requiring a determination of stockholders. A determination of stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a stockholders' meeting is effective for any
adjournment of the meeting unless the board fixes a new record date, which it
must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than one hundred twenty (120)
days after the date fixed for the original meeting.

have express or other notice thereof, save as expressly provided by the laws of
Alabama.

       Section 5. The holder of any share of stock shall immediately notify the
corporation of any loss, destruction or mutilation of the certificate therefor,
and the board may, in its discretion, and after the expiration of such period of
time as it may determine to be advisable, cause a new certificate or
certificates for shares of stock to be issued, upon the surrender of the
mutilated certificate, or in case of loss or destruction of the certificate,
upon proof satisfactory to the board of such loss or destruction. The board may,
in its sole discretion, require the owner of the lost, destroyed or mutilated
certificate, or his legal representatives, to give the corporation a bond, in
such sum and with such surety or sureties as it may direct, to indemnify the
corporation against any claim that may be made against it on account of the
alleged loss, destruction or mutilation of any such certificate or the issuance
of such new certificate.

                                    Dividends

       Section 6. Subject to the provisions of the Charter, dividends upon the
capital stock of the corporation when earned, may be declared by the board of
directors at any regular meeting, or any special meeting. Before paying any
dividend or making any distribution of profits, there may be set aside out of
the surplus or net profits of the corporation such sum or sums as the board of
directors from time to time in its absolute discretion may determine to be
proper, as a reserve fund to meet contingencies or for equalizing dividends or
for repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation or for such other
purpose as the board shall think proper.

                         Annual Reports to Stockholders

to each of its stockholders, not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after
the close of each of its fiscal years, a financial statement, which may be
consolidated, including a balance sheet as of the end of such fiscal year and a
statement of income for such fiscal year. Such financial statement shall be
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or, if the
books of the corporation are not maintained on that basis, may be prepared
either on the same basis used by the corporation for filing its United States
income tax returns or as required by appropriate regulatory agencies. The
financial statement shall be accompanied by a report of the president, the
officer of the corporation in charge of its financial records or a certified
public accountant stating whether, in his opinion, the financial statements of
the corporation present fairly the financial position of the corporation and the
results of its operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and, if not, describing the basis of their preparation and giving his
opinion of the fairness of the presentation of the data shown by them, in
accordance with accounting procedures generally used in the trade, industry or
business conducted by the corporation.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                 CORPORATE SEAL

       Section 1. Whenever under the provision of these by-laws notice is
required to be given to any director, officer or stockholder, it shall not be
construed to mean personal notice, but such written notice may be given by mail
or private carrier, with postage thereon prepaid, or by e-mail transmission or
other similar electronic means of communication providing evidence of
transmission addressed to such stockholder, officer or director, at such address
as it appears on the books of the corporation, or in default of other address,
to such stockholder, director or officer at the general post office at the
principal office of the corporation in the State of Alabama. Written notice to
the corporation's stockholders is effective when mailed, if mailed postpaid and
correctly addressed to the stockholder's address shown on the books of the
corporation. Notice to directors may also be given in person, or by telephone,
telecopy or facsimile transmission. Any stockholder, director or officer may
waive any notice required to be given either by statute or under these by-laws;
and all meetings of stockholders and directors may be held without notice, if
waived, at such time and place as may be fixed.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                       INDEMNIFICATION AND RELATED MATTERS

       Section 1. Each person who is or was a director, officer or employee of
the corporation holding one or more positions of management through and
inclusive of department managers or other employees explicitly designated in
writing by the president or a vice president of the Company (such individuals
being hereinafter referred to as "indemnified parties") and who was or is a
party or was or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a
director of the corporation or officer or employee of the corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee,
agent or trustee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall be indemnified by the
corporation as a matter of right against any and all expenses (including
attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him and against any and all
claims, judgments, fines, penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
actually incurred by him in defense of such claim, action, suit or proceeding,
including appeals, to the full extent permitted by applicable law. The
indemnification provided by this Section shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

       Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an indemnified party
with respect to the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding may be
advanced by the corporation prior to the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit or proceeding, as authorized by the board of directors in the
specific case, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person
entitled to be indemnified by the corporation under this Section or otherwise;
provided, however, that the advancement of such expenses shall not be deemed to
be indemnification unless and until it shall ultimately be determined that such
person is entitled to be indemnified by the corporation.

       The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance at the expense of the
corporation on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the corporation, or any person who is or was serving at the request
of the corporation as a director (or the equivalent), officer, employee, agent
or trustee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability or expense (including
attorneys' fees) asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity,
or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have
the power to indemnify him against such liability or expense under this Section
or otherwise.

       Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this
Section, no present or future director or officer of the corporation, or his
heirs, executors, or administrators, shall be liable for any act, omission,
step, or conduct taken or had in good faith, which is required, authorized, or
approved by any order or orders issued pursuant to the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, or any federal or state statue or
municipal ordinance regulating the corporation or its parent by reason of their
being holding or investment companies, public utility companies, public utility
holding companies, or subsidiaries of public utility holding companies. In any
action, suit, or proceeding based on any act, omission, step, or conduct, as in
this paragraph described, the provisions hereof shall be brought to the
attention of the court. In the event that the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph are found by the court not to constitute a valid defense on the
grounds of not being applicable to the particular class of plaintiff, each such
director and officer, and his heirs, executors, and administrators, shall be
reimbursed for, or indemnified against, all expenses and liabilities incurred by
him or imposed on him, in connection with, or arising out of, any such action,
suit, or proceeding based on any act, omission, step, or conduct taken or had in
good faith as in this paragraph described. Such expenses and liabilities shall
include, but shall not be limited to, judgments, court costs, and attorneys'
fees.

       The foregoing rights shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which
any such director or officer or employee may otherwise be entitled and shall be
available whether or not the director or officer or employee continues to be a
director or officer or employee at the time of incurring any such expenses and
liabilities.

                                   ARTICLE XIV

                     SEVERABILITY AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION

       Section 1. If any word, clause or provision of the by-laws or any
indemnification made under Article XIII hereof shall for any reason be
determined to be invalid, the provisions of the by-laws shall not otherwise be
affected thereby but shall remain in full force and effect. The masculine
pronoun, as used in the by-laws, means the masculine and feminine wherever
applicable.

         If on any date the Buydown Amount for more than one Substantially

SECTION 2.01. The Advances. (a) The Advances. Each Lender severally agrees, on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to make Advances to the
Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Funds
Availability Date to the Final Maturity Date in an aggregate amount not to
exceed at any time outstanding the amount set forth opposite such Lender's name
on Schedule I or, if such Lender has entered into any Assignment and Acceptance,
set forth for such Lender in the Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to
Section 8.07(d), as such amount may be reduced pursuant to Section 2.04 (such
Lender's "Commitment"); provided that (i) only one Borrowing of Project Advances
shall be permitted with respect to each of the Dahlberg Project and any
Subsequent Project which, as of the date of acquisition thereof by a Borrower
Group Member, is a Completed Project; (ii) Project Advances for any Project
shall be made in an aggregate amount not to exceed the Project Limit for such
Project (as reduced, in accordance with Section 2.15, to reflect the aggregate
amount of all outstanding CP Commitment Reservations, if any, relating to such
Project); (iii) CP Advances for any purpose shall be made in an aggregate amount
not to exceed the aggregate of all CP Commitment Reservations for such purpose;
(iv) Working Capital Advances shall be made in an aggregate amount not to exceed
the lesser of (A) the Borrowing Limit for Working Capital Advances (as reduced,
in accordance with Section 2.15, to reflect the aggregate amount of all
outstanding CP Commitment Reservations, if any, relating to Commercial Paper
issued by the Borrower for the Borrower's general corporate purposes or to
provide working capital for the Borrower); and (B) the aggregate of all Unused
Commitments minus all CP Commitment Reservations; and (v) the aggregate
principal amount of all outstanding Advances and CP Commitment Reservations
shall not exceed $650,000,000. Each Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of
$5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, except for
any Borrowing of the remaining Unused portion of the Commitments available for
the making of Advances within the applicable Borrowing Limit. Each Borrowing
shall consist of Advances of the same Type and Category made on the same day by
the Lenders ratably according to their respective Commitments. The Borrower may
make more than one Borrowing on the same day; provided that (x) such Borrowings
are of different Categories; and (y) no more than two Borrowings of each
Category may be made during any one calendar month. Within each Lender's
Commitment, the applicable Borrowing Limit and the Availability Period, and
subject to the conditions set forth in Article III, the Borrower may borrow
under this Section 2.01, prepay pursuant to Section 2.09 and reborrow under this
Section 2.01.

(b)      Project Limit Modification. The Borrower shall have the right, upon at
         least thirty (30) days' notice to the Agent, to modify the Project
         Limit applicable to any Uncompleted Project; provided that:

(i)      the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Advances and CP
         Commitment Reservations shall not exceed $650,000,000;

(ii)     the aggregate of all increases in the Project Limit for any Project may
         not exceed 10% of the Initial Project Limit for such Project;

         to zero, the Agent shall have received an Adjusted Project Budget for
         such Project; and

(iv)     the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Advances and CP
         Commitment Reservations with respect to such Project shall not exceed
         the Project Limit, upon such modification, for such Project.

(c)      Designated Lenders. For any Lender which is a Designating Lender, any
         Advance to be made by such Lender may from time to time be made by its
         Designated Lender in such Designated Lender's sole discretion, and
         nothing herein shall constitute a commitment to make Advances by such
         Designated Lender; provided that if any Designated Lender elects not
         to, or fails to, make any such Advance, its Designating Lender hereby
         agrees that it shall make such Advance pursuant to the terms of this
         Agreement. Any Advance actually funded by a Designated Lender shall
         constitute a utilization of the Commitment and, in the case of a CP
         Advance, the CP Commitment of the Designating Lender for all purposes
         under this Agreement.

SECTION 2.02. Making the Advances. (a) Each Borrowing shall be made on notice,
given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day
prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing
consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, or not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing
consisting of Base Rate Advances, by the Borrower to the Agent, which shall give
to each Lender prompt notice thereof by telecopier. Each such notice of a
Borrowing (a "Notice of Utilization") shall be by telephone, confirmed
immediately by telecopier in substantially the form of Exhibit B, (i) specifying
therein the requested (A) date of such Borrowing; (B) Type and Category of
Advances comprising such Borrowing; (C) aggregate amount of such Borrowing; (D)
in the case of a Borrowing comprising Project Advances or CP Advances, aggregate
principal amount of the Advances to be made with respect to each Project; and
(E) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, initial
Interest Period for each such Advance; (ii) in the case of a Borrowing
comprising of Project Advances, specifying therein the relevant Project(s) and
containing a representation that proceeds of the requested Borrowing will be
used to finance Project Costs for such Project(s) (including, in the case of any
Project, repayment of any Affiliate Subordinated Debt incurred by the Borrower
(A) to fund the costs of acquiring such Project prior to the initial Advances
hereunder in respect of such Project or (B) to pay Project Costs in respect of
such Project at any time prior to the Non-Recourse Date for such Project);(iii)
in the case of a Borrowing comprising CP Advances, specifying the relevant
Project(s), if any, and CP Commitment Reservation(s) pursuant to which such CP
Advances are requested; (iv) containing a representation that such Borrowing
will not result in the applicable Borrowing Limit to be exceeded or the
aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Advances and CP Commitment
Reservations to exceed $650,000,000; and (v) specifying the aggregate principal
amount of all outstanding Advances and the unused Commitments and CP
Commitments, in each case, after giving effect to the proposed Borrowing. Each
Lender shall, before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of such
Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to
the Agent at the Agent's Account, in same day funds, such Lender's ratable
portion of such Borrowing; provided that if a Notice of Utilization in respect
of a proposed Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances is given on the date of
such Borrowing, the Lenders shall so make available their ratable portions of
such Borrowing before 3:00 P.M. (New York City time) on such date. After the
Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions
set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such funds available to the
Borrower at the Agent's address referred to in Section 8.02.

(b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Borrowing if the
obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall then be
suspended pursuant to Section 2.07(e) or 2.11.

(c) The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any actual and documented
loss (excluding any loss of profit and/or margin), cost or expense reasonably
incurred by such Lender as a result of (i) the revocation by the Borrower of (A)
any Notice of Utilization for a Borrowing that such Notice of Utilization
specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances; or (B) any notice
given by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.08 of the Conversion of Base Rate
Advances to Eurodollar Rate Advances; and (ii) any failure to fulfill on or
before the date specified in a Notice of Utilization for a Borrowing the
applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, in each such case,
any loss (excluding loss of profit and/or margin), cost or expense reasonably
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as part of
such Borrowing or as a result of such Conversion when such Advance, as a result
of such revocation or failure, is not made on the date specified therefor in the
relevant Notice of Utilization or when such Base Rate Advances, as a result of
such revocation, are not converted to Eurodollar Rate Advances, but excluding,
however, any such losses, costs and expenses resulting from any such revocation
or failure which has occurred more than ninety (90) days prior to demand being
made to the Borrower by such Lender for indemnification. The payment of such
indemnity to a Lender shall be made within thirty (30) days of a demand by such
Lender complying with Section 8.04(d).

(d) With respect to any Borrowing, unless the Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the date of such Borrowing (in the case of a proposed
Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances) or on or before 1:00 P.M. (New
York City time) on the date of such Borrowing (in the case of a Borrowing
consisting of Base Rate Advances) that such Lender will not make available to
the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume
that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of
such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.02(a) and the Agent may, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so
made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and the Borrower
severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the
Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the
time to Advances comprising such Borrowing; and (ii) in the case of such Lender,
the Federal Funds Effective Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such
corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's
Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

(e) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of
any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any,
under this Agreement to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

SECTION 2.03. Fees. (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for
the account of each Lender a commitment fee on the daily Unused portion of such
Lender's Commitment, (i) in the case of each Initial Lender, from the date of
this Agreement; and (ii) in the case of each other Lender (other than a
Designated Lender), from the effective date specified in the Assignment and
Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender, in each case, until the
Commitment Termination Date at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable
Commitment Fee Percentage in effect from time to time, payable in arrears on the
fifteenth day of each March, June, September and December, and on the Commitment
Termination Date.

(b) Agent's Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for its own account such
fees as may from time to time be agreed between the Borrower and the Agent.

SECTION 2.04. Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. The Borrower shall
have the right, upon at least three (3) Business Days' notice to the Agent, to
terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portions of the
respective Commitments of the Lenders; provided that (a) each partial reduction
shall be in the aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (b) the aggregate of all Commitments, upon
such reduction, shall not be less than the aggregate principal amount of all
Utilizations then outstanding.

SECTION 2.05. Repayment of the Advances. The Borrower shall repay to the Agent
for the ratable account of the Lenders on the Final Maturity Date the aggregate
principal amount of the Advances then outstanding.

SECTION 2.06. Interest on the Advances. (a) Scheduled Interest. The Borrower
shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance owing to each
Lender from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid
in full, at the following rates per annum:

         Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of (A) the Base

         effect from time to time, payable in arrears on the fifteenth day of
         each March, June, September and December during such periods and on the
         date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

(ii)     Eurodollar Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance is a
         Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during
         each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (A) the Eurodollar
         Rate for such Interest Period for such Advance plus (B) the Applicable
         Margin in effect from time to time, payable in arrears on the last day
         of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of

         Period and on the date such Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be Converted
         or paid in full.

(b)      Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
         Event of Default under Section 6.01(a) or any failure to prepay or
         repay any Project Debt in accordance with Section 2.09(b), the Borrower
         shall pay interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Advance
         owing to each Lender (in the case of such an Event of Default or any
         failure to prepay or repay Project Debt in accordance with any of
         Section 2.09(b)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v)) or each Advance so required to
         be prepaid pursuant to Section 2.09(b)(i), as the case may be, in each
         case, payable in arrears on the dates referred to in Section 2.06(a)(i)
         or (a)(ii) above and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times

         the fullest extent permitted by Law, the amount of any interest, fee or
         other amount payable under this Agreement or under any Note that is not

         to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on Base
         Rate Advances pursuant to Section 2.06(a)(i) above.

SECTION 2.07. Interest Rate Determination. (a) Each Reference Bank agrees to
furnish to the Agent, at its request, timely information for the purpose of
determining each Eurodollar Rate. If any one or more of the Reference Banks
shall not furnish such timely information to the Agent for the purpose of
determining any such interest rate, the Agent shall determine such interest rate
on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks.
The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Lenders of the
applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for purposes of Section
2.06(a)(i) or (ii), and the rate, if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for
the purpose of determining the interest rate under Section 2.06(a)(ii).

(b)      If (i) the Agent is unable for any reason to determine the Eurodollar
         Rate for any Interest Period; (ii) if applicable, fewer than two
         Reference Banks furnish timely information to the Agent for determining
         the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period pursuant to Section
         2.07(a); or (iii) the Majority Lenders notify the Agent by 12:00 noon
         (London time) two Business Days prior to the first day of any Interest
         Period that the Majority Lenders were unable to obtain, at
         approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) on such Business Day and at the
         applicable Eurodollar Rate, Dollar deposits for a period equal to such
         Interest Period and in amounts substantially equal to such Majority
         Lenders' respective Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising part of the
         Borrowing to be outstanding during such Interest Period, the Agent
         shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of such event,
         whereupon:

(A)      within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such notification, the
         Agent and the Borrower shall enter into good faith negotiations for a
         period of fifteen (15) days (or such shorter period as is required to
         agree to the alternative basis referred to in this clause (A)) with a
         view to agreeing on an alternative basis for determining the rate of
         interest applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Advances;

(B)      any alternative basis agreed under clause (A) above with the approval
         of the Majority Lenders and any interest rate determined pursuant
         thereto will be binding on all the parties to this Agreement and will
         be retroactive to, and take effect from, the first day of the
         applicable Interest Period;

(C)  if no alternative basis is agreed under clause (A) above within the 15-day
     period there specified, the Agent, upon instructions of the Majority
     Lenders, shall, on behalf of each of the Lenders, set forth an alternative
     basis for determining the rate of interest applicable to such Eurodollar
     Rate Advances on or before the last day of the Interest Period to which the
     notification relates or, if earlier, within ten (10) days after the
     expiration of the 15-day period set forth in clause (A) above. Each Lender
     shall certify to the Agent and to the Borrower such Lender's actual cost of
     funds for funding its applicable Eurodollar Rate Advances, and the Majority
     Lenders shall certify to the Agent and the Borrower in reasonable detail
     the alternative basis for determining the rate of interest to be applicable
     to such Eurodollar Rate Advances and such interest rate as so determined;

(D)      any interest rate determined pursuant to clause (C) above shall not, in
         any event, exceed (1) the Majority Lenders' reasonable determination of
         the cost to the Lenders, as certified by them pursuant to clause (C)
         above, of funding their applicable Eurodollar Rate Advances plus (2)
         the Applicable Margin;

(E)      each alternative basis so certified by the Majority Lenders pursuant to
         clause (C) above and each interest rate determined pursuant thereto
         shall be binding on the Borrower and the Lenders and shall be
         retroactive to, and take effect from, the first day of the applicable
         Interest Period; and

(F)      so long as any alternative basis referred to above is in force, the
         Agent, in consultation with the Borrower and the Majority Lenders,
         shall from time to time, but not less frequently than monthly, review
         whether or not the circumstances referred to in this Section 2.07(b)
         still prevail with a view to returning to the normal provisions of this
         Agreement in relation to the method of determining interest as soon as
         practicably possible.

(c)      If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest
         Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the
         provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section
         1.01, then on the last day of the then existing Interest Period
         therefor, if the Borrower could have selected an Interest Period for
         such Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with such provisions, an
         Interest Period with a duration of three (3) months shall be applicable
         to such Eurodollar Rate Advances or, if the Borrower could not have
         selected any Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances in
         accordance with such provisions, such Eurodollar Rate Advances will
         automatically, on such last day, Convert into Base Rate Advances, and
         the Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders thereof.

(d)      On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
         Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by
         payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $10,000,000, such
         Advances shall automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

(e)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of (i) any Event of
         Default, (A) each Eurodollar Rate Advance then outstanding will
         automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period
         therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance; and (B) the obligation of
         the Lenders to make, or to Convert Base Rate Advances into, Eurodollar
         Rate Advances shall be suspended until all Events of Default have been
         cured or waived; and (ii) any failure to prepay any Eurodollar Rate
         Advance in accordance with Section 2.09(b)(i), (A) each Eurodollar Rate
         Advance required to be so prepaid will automatically, on the last day
         of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
         Advance; and (B) the Lenders shall have no obligation to Convert any
         Base Rate Advances required to be prepaid pursuant to Section
         2.09(b)(i) into Eurodollar Rate Advances.

SECTION 2.08. Optional Conversion of the Advances. The Borrower may on any
Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed
Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.07 and 2.11, Convert all
Advances of one Type comprising the same Borrowing into Advances of the other
Type; provided that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate
Advances shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Rate Advances and any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount
specified in Section 2.01(a). Each such notice of a Conversion shall, within the
restrictions specified above, specify (a) the date of such Conversion; (b) the
Advances to be Converted; and (c) if such Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate
Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period for each such Advance.

SECTION 2.09. Prepayments. (a) Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may, upon at
least three (3) Business Days' notice (in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances)
or upon at least one Business Day's notice (in the case of Base Rate Advances)
to the Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the
prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay the
outstanding principal amount of the Advances comprising part of the same
Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the
date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided that (i) each
partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 or
an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (ii) in the event of
any such prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower shall be
obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section
8.04(c).

(b) Mandatory Prepayments. (i) Upon the occurrence of a Southern Event of
Default, the Borrower shall prepay, (A) with respect to all Projects which have
not yet achieved Substantial Completion, all Project Debt then outstanding with
respect to such Projects; and (B) with respect to each Substantially Completed
Project the Buydown Date for which has not then occurred, such portion of
Project Debt then outstanding with respect to such Substantially Completed
Project as is equal to the Buydown Amount for such Substantially Completed
Project, in each case, in accordance with clause (c) below.

(ii) Upon the occurrence of the Buydown Date for any Project, the Borrower shall
prepay (A) if Substantial Completion of such Project has not then been achieved,
all Project Debt then outstanding with respect to such Project; or (B) if
Substantial Completion of such Project has then been achieved, such portion of
such Project Debt as is equal to the Buydown Amount for such Project, in each
case, in accordance with clause (c) below.

(iii) On the date (the "Sale Prepayment Date") which is either (1) the earlier
of (A) the date falling six (6) months after any Sale; and (B) the prepayment
date specified in a prepayment notice from the Borrower with respect to the Sale
Proceeds from such Sale, or (2) the date specified in sub-clauses (B), (D) or
(F) below, if applicable, to the extent any Sale Proceeds from such Sale have
not been reinvested in a Similar Asset in accordance with Section 5.01(m), the
Borrower shall use such Sale Proceeds to prepay the then outstanding Project
Debt (but in no event more than in an amount equal to such Sale Proceeds) to the
extent necessary to result in the minimum and average Portfolio Adjusted Base
Case Projections, calculated on the assumption that all Recourse Debt of the
Borrower and the Relevant Subsidiaries outstanding immediately following such
prepayment is repaid in full on or prior to the end of the Remaining Base Case
Period, with such Debt being prepaid or repaid (as the case may be) in the
following order of priority: (A) Completed Project Advances, if any, on a pro
rata basis, together with interest thereon; (B) to the extent of any such Sale
Proceeds remaining thereafter, Commercial Paper, if any, then outstanding with
respect to Completed Projects, on the maturity date thereof and on a pro rata
basis, together with interest thereon (if any); (C) to the extent of any such
Sale Proceeds remaining thereafter, Advances, if any, then outstanding with
respect to the Asset the sale of which resulted in such Sale Proceeds, on a pro
rata basis, together with interest thereon; (D) to the extent of any such Sale
Proceeds remaining thereafter, Commercial Paper, if any, then outstanding with
respect to such Asset, on the maturity date thereof and on a pro rata basis,
together with interest thereon; (E) to the extent of any such Sale Proceeds
remaining thereafter, all other Advances, if any, then outstanding, on a pro
rata basis, together with interest thereon; and (F) to the extent of any such
Sale Proceeds remaining thereafter, all other Commercial Paper, if any, then
outstanding, on the maturity date thereof and on a pro rata basis, together with
interest thereon.

                  Contemporaneously with (AA) such prepayment of Advances, the
Project Limit for the relevant Project shall automatically be reduced by the
amount of such prepayment; and (BB) such repayment of Commercial Paper, each of
the Project Limit for the relevant Project and the CP Commitments of the Lenders
with respect to such Commercial Paper, if any, shall automatically be reduced
(on a pro rata basis) by the amount of such repayment.

(iv)     Upon any Loss with respect to a Completed Project, the Borrower shall
         repay, if required, the relevant Project Debt then outstanding in
         accordance with Section 5.01(l).

(v)      Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the proceeds of any
         Refinancing relating to any Project, and upon at least three (3)
         Business Days' notice (in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances) or upon
         at least one Business Day's notice (in the case of Base Rate Advances)
         to the Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount
         of the payment, apply such proceeds to repay Project Debt then
         outstanding with respect to such Project, and interest thereon, in
         accordance with clause (c) below.

(c)      All prepayments or repayments (as the case may be) of Project Debt with
         respect to any particular Project pursuant to clause (b)(i), (ii), (iv)
         and (v) above and Section 5.01(l) shall be made using funds other than
         the proceeds of any Borrowing or any Commercial Paper as to which CP
         Commitments are outstanding or requested, in the following order of
         priority:

(i)      firstly, to all Project Advances and all CP Advances, if any, made with
         respect to such Project, on a pro rata basis, together with interest
         thereon; and

(ii)     secondly, upon the maturity thereof, to all Commercial Paper, if any,
         then outstanding with respect to such Project and as to which CP
         Commitments are then in effect, on a pro rata basis, together with
         interest thereon (if any).

                  Contemporaneously with (A) such prepayment of Advances, the
Project Limit for the relevant Project shall automatically be reduced by the
amount of such prepayment; and (B) such repayment of Commercial Paper, each of
the Project Limit for the relevant Project and the CP Commitments of the Lenders
with respect to such Commercial Paper, if any, shall automatically be reduced
(on a pro rata basis) by the amount of such repayment.

SECTION 2.10. Increased Costs. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for
its actual and documented losses (whether due to decreased revenues or increased
costs) that are the result of a change of Law or in the official interpretation
thereof or compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or
other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such Lender (whether or
not having the force of law) adopted or made (a) in the case of the Initial
Lenders, after the date of this Agreement; and (b) in the case of any other
Lender, after the date such Lender shall have become a party to this Agreement
by executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance or a Designation
Agreement (as the case may be), which costs are reasonably incurred by such
Lender and are the result of (i) such Lender agreeing to make or making, funding
or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances; or (ii) any increase in the amount of
capital required to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling
such Lender, based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend under
this Agreement and other commitments of this type, to the extent that such
Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the
existence of such Lender's commitment to lend under this Agreement. The
foregoing indemnity shall not apply to (A) any such change of Law or
interpretation or any adoption or making of any such guideline or request that
is anticipated on the date of this Agreement, (B) any period or periods ending
more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to demand for indemnification
being made or (C) any such losses resulting from (1) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to
which Section 2.13 shall govern); or (2) changes in the basis of taxation of
overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or by the
foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender is organized
or has its Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof. The
Borrower shall from time to time, within thirty (30) days following demand by
such Lender complying with Section 8.04(d) (with a copy of such demand to the
Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Lender for such losses.

SECTION 2.11. Illegality. If as a result of a change in Law or in the official
interpretation thereof (a) in the case of the Initial Lenders, after the date of
this Agreement; and (b) in the case of any other Lender, after the date such
Lender shall have become a party to this Agreement by executing and delivering
an Assignment and Acceptance or a Designation Agreement (as the case may be), it
shall have become unlawful, or if after the applicable date set forth above any
central bank or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such
Lender asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender to (i) allow all or part of
its commitment to make Eurodollar Rate Advances to remain outstanding; or (ii)
make, fund or allow to remain outstanding all or part of its Eurodollar Rate
Advances, such Lender may notify the Borrower and the Agent thereof in
reasonable detail (together with supporting documentation) of such event,
whereupon:

                  (A) such Lender's obligations to make Eurodollar Rate Advances
         shall be suspended and, forty-five (45) days following such
         notification, shall be canceled if such unlawfulness shall then be
         continuing; and

                  (B) the Borrower will prepay such Lender's Eurodollar Rate
         Advances or convert them to Base Rate Advances at the time or times and
         to the extent necessary to avoid such unlawfulness, together with
         unpaid accrued interest thereon, unpaid accrued fees and any other
         amounts due and payable to such Lender,

unless, in either case, prior thereto, the Borrower shall have given notice to
such Lender that the Borrower will require such Lender to assign and transfer
all of its interests in this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.07(b) and shall
have caused such Lender to have so assigned and transferred such interests.

SECTION 2.12. Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrower shall make each
payment under this Agreement and under the Notes not later than 11:00 A.M. (New
York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Agent at the Agent's
Account in same day funds. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be
distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or
commitment fees to the Lenders ratably in accordance with such amounts owing to
the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and
like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to
such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be
applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided that unless
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, funds so paid by the Borrower on
account of any principal or interest due under this Agreement shall be applied
first to satisfy such amounts due with respect to Completed Project Advances and
Working Capital Advances, pari passu (or as otherwise specified by the
Borrower), and, after all such amounts are paid, to the corresponding amounts
due with respect to Uncompleted Project Advances. Upon its acceptance of an
Assignment and Acceptance or a Designation Agreement and recording of the
information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from
and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance or
Designation Agreement (as the case may be), the Agent shall make all payments
hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the
Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance or
Designation Agreement (as the case may be) shall make all appropriate
adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly
between themselves.

(b) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made by the
Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all
computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds
Effective Rate and of commitment fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of
a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the
first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such
interest or commitment fees are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an
interest rate under this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

(c) Whenever any payment under this Agreement or under the Notes shall be stated
to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day; provided that if such extension would cause
payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in
the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next
preceding Business Day. Any such extension or reduction of time shall be
included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment fee, as the
case may be.

(d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the
date on which any payment is due to the Lenders under this Agreement that the
Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the
Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on
such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the
extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent,
each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed
to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such
amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such
amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

SECTION 2.13. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower under this
Agreement or under the Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.12,
without deduction for any Taxes or Other Taxes (each as defined below).

                  "Taxes" means any and all present or future taxes, levies,
         imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings with respect to any
         payment by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or any Note, and all
         liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each
         Lender and the Agent, taxes imposed on its income, net worth or gross
         receipts and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it by a jurisdiction
         under the laws of which such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)
         is organized or in which its principal executive office is located or
         any political subdivision thereof or, in the case of each Lender, in
         which its Applicable Lending Office is located or any political
         subdivision thereof; and (ii) in the case of each Lender, any United
         States withholding tax imposed on such payments except to the extent
         that such Lender is subject to United States withholding tax by reason
         of a U.S. Tax Law Change.

                  "Other Taxes" means any present or future stamp or documentary
         taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or similar charges or
         levies, which arise from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or
         under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with
         respect to, this Agreement or any Note.

                  "U.S. Tax Law Change" means with respect to any Lender the
         occurrence (i) in the case of the Initial Lenders, after the date of
         this Agreement; and (ii) in the case of any other Lender, after the
         date such Lender shall have become a party to this Agreement by
         executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance or a Designation
         Agreement (as the case may be), of the adoption of any applicable
         United States federal law or regulation relating to taxation, or any
         change therein or in the official interpretation thereof, or the entry
         into force, modification or revocation of any income tax convention or
         treaty to which the United States is a party.

                  If the Borrower shall be required by Law to deduct any Taxes
or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under this Agreement or
under any Note to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
2.13) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made; (ii) the
Borrower shall make such deductions; (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable Law; and (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the
Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02, the original or a certified
copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

(b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and the Agent for the full
amount of actual and documented Taxes or Other Taxes (including taxes of any
kind imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.13)
paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) as a result of any U.S.
Tax Law Change and any actual and documented liability (including penalties,
interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto paid by such
Lender or the Agent (as the case may be), but excluding, however, any Taxes or
Other Taxes so paid by such Lender or the Agent more than one hundred and twenty
(120) days prior to demand being made to the Borrower by such Lender or the
Agent for indemnification. The payment of such indemnity shall be made within
thirty (30) days from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)
makes written demand therefor complying with Section 8.04(d).

(c) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United
States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement
in the case of the Initial Lenders and on the date of the Assignment and
Acceptance or Designation Agreement (as the case may be) pursuant to which it
becomes a Lender in the case of any other Lender, and from time to time
thereafter as requested in writing by the Borrower or the Agent (but only so
long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the
Agent and the Borrower with two completed and duly executed original Internal
Revenue Service forms W-8 W-8ECI or W-8BEN, as appropriate, or any successor or
other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, or other documentation
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, certifying that such Lender
is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on
payments pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes. If the form provided by a
Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates
a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax
at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such
Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies,
whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded
from Taxes for periods governed by such form. If any form or document referred
to in this subsection (c) requires the disclosure of information, other than
information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the
date of this Agreement by Internal Revenue Service form W-8, W-8ECI or W-8BEN,
that the Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give
notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such
form or document such confidential information.

(d) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide the
Borrower with the appropriate form or document (or information required by such
form or document) described in Section 2.13(c) (other than if such failure is
due to a U.S. Tax Law Change), such Lender shall not be entitled to payments
without deduction and indemnification under Section 2.13(a) or (b) with respect
to any Taxes or Other Taxes which would not have been payable had such form or
document (or information required thereby) been so provided; provided that
should a Lender, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of
withholding tax, become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a
form or document (or information required thereby), required under Section
2.13(c), the Borrower shall take such reasonable steps as the Lender shall
request to assist the Lender to recover such Taxes (it being understood,
however, that the Borrower shall have no liability to such Lender in respect of
such Taxes).

(e) If the Borrower is required to indemnify or pay additional amounts to or for
the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13, then such Lender will
take such action (including changing the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending
Office) as in the reasonable judgment of such Lender (i) will eliminate or
reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue; and (ii) is not
otherwise commercially unreasonable.

(f) Each Lender and the Agent shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain in a
timely fashion any refund, deduction or credit of any Taxes and Other Taxes paid
or reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.13. If any Lender or
the Agent receives a benefit in the nature of a refund, deduction or credit
(including a refund in the form of a deduction from or credit against taxes that
are otherwise payable by the Lender or the Agent) of any Taxes or Other Taxes
with respect to which the Borrower has made a payment under Section 2.13(a) or
(b), such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) agrees to reimburse the
Borrower to the extent of the benefit of such refund, deduction or credit
promptly after the Agent or such Lender reasonably determines that such refund,
deduction or credit has become final; provided that nothing contained in this
subsection (f) shall require any Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) to
make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes
which it deems to be confidential) or to attempt to obtain any such refund,
deduction or credit, which attempt would be inconsistent with any reporting
position otherwise taken by the Agent or such Lender on its applicable tax
returns.

SECTION 2.14. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment
(whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off,
or otherwise) on account of the Advances of any Nature owing to it (other than
pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.03, 2.10, 2.11, 2.13 or 8.04) in excess of its
ratable share of payments on account of Advances of the same Nature obtained by
all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders
such participations in the Advances of such Nature owing to them as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably
with each of them; provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender
shall be rescinded and each Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender such
purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to
such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of
such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender
pursuant to this Section 2.14 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect
to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 2.15. Reservation of CP Commitments. On the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, each Lender shall allocate from time to time all or any
portion of its Commitment (such Lender's "CP Commitment") to provide liquidity
support for Commercial Paper issued or to be issued by the Borrower (i) with
respect to any Project, (ii) for the Borrower's general corporate purposes or to
provide working capital for the Borrower, and/or (iii) to allow the Borrower, as
permitted under this Agreement, to make a Restricted Payment or to repay
Affiliate Subordinated Debt; provided that such CP Commitment shall be
automatically reduced if and to the extent of all CP Advances made with respect
to such CP Commitment and, if requested by the Borrower, if and to the extent
the Commercial Paper issued with respect to which such CP Commitment was
established is not refinanced on its maturity by the issuance of Rollover
Commercial Paper. The Borrower may make more than one CP Commitment Reservation
on the same day; provided that (a) no more than two CP Commitment Reservations
of each Kind may be made during any one calendar month; and (b) only one CP
Commitment (Original CP) Reservation shall be permitted with respect to any
Project which is a Completed Project as of the Funds Availability Date or, if
later, the date of acquisition of such Project by a Borrower Group Member. Each
CP Commitment Reservation shall be made during the Availability Period, in an
aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof and shall be made pro rata among all Lenders (according to their
respective Commitments) following notice by the Borrower, given not later than
the third Business Day prior to the date of a proposed CP Commitment
Reservation, to the Agent (which shall give to each Lender prompt notice
thereof), and upon a Utilization by way of CP Commitment Reservation, and to the
extent it is still outstanding, (A) the unused portion of the Commitments
available to the Borrower for Project Advances, Working Capital Advances and
other CP Commitment Reservations shall be reduced by the outstanding amount of
such Utilization; and (B) the Project Limit for such Project or the Borrowing
Limit for Working Capital Advances, as applicable, shall be reduced by the
outstanding amount of such Utilization. Each such notice of a CP Commitment
Reservation shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately by telecopier in
substantially the form of Exhibit B, (a) specifying therein (i) the requested
date of such CP Commitment Reservation and aggregate amount of such CP
Commitment Reservation; (ii) in the case of Original Commercial Paper, the
aggregate principal amount of the Commercial Paper issued, or to be issued, for
which such CP Commitment Reservation is requested (the amount of which
Commercial Paper shall equal the CP Commitment Reservation requested) and
specifying the relevant Project with respect to, or other purpose for, which
such Commercial Paper is, or is to be, issued; and (iii) in the case of
Refinancing Commercial Paper, the Project Advances, CP Advances, Working Capital
Advances or, as otherwise permitted hereunder, Affiliate Subordinated Debt or
Restricted Payments, as applicable, to be repaid or paid with proceeds from such
Commercial Paper; (b) containing a representation that proceeds of such
Commercial Paper will be used (i) to finance or refinance Project Costs
(including, in the case of any Project, repayment of any Affiliate Subordinated
Debt incurred by the Borrower (A) to fund the costs of acquiring such Project
and Project Costs paid in respect of such Project prior to the initial Advances
hereunder in respect of such Project, or (B) to pay Project Costs in respect of
such Project at any time prior to the Non-Recourse Date for such Project)
incurred for such Project, for the Borrower's general corporate purposes or to
provide working capital for the Borrower, and/or to allow the Borrower, as
permitted under this Agreement, to make a Restricted Payment or to repay
Affiliate Subordinated Debt (in the case of a CP Commitment (Original CP)
Reservation), and/or (ii) to repay outstanding Project Advances made with
respect to such Project or to repay outstanding Working Capital Advances (in the
case of a CP Commitment (Refinancing CP) Reservation); and (c) specifying the
aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Advances, the unused Commitments
and all outstanding CP Commitments, in each case, after giving effect to the
proposed CP Commitment Reservation, issuance of such Commercial Paper and
application of proceeds therefrom. All repayments of Commercial Paper made on
the same day shall be applied (I) first, to amounts due on such date with
respect to Commercial Paper relating to Completed Projects, Commercial Paper
issued for the Borrower's general corporate purposes or to provide working
capital for the Borrower and Commercial Paper issued to make a Restricted
Payment or to repay Affiliate Subordinated Debt (as permitted by this
Agreement), pari passu (or as otherwise specified by the Borrower), and (II)
after all such amounts are paid, to amounts due on such date with respect to
Commercial Paper relating to Uncompleted Projects.

SECTION 2.16. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of Advances shall be used (a) to
finance Project Costs, to repay any Affiliate Subordinated Debt incurred by the
Borrower to fund the acquisition and construction of any Project prior to the
date of the initial Advances hereunder with respect to such Project or to repay
any Affiliate Subordinated Debt incurred by the Borrower to pay Project Costs of
any Project at any time prior to the Non-Recourse Date for such Project (such
Advances, "Project Advances"); (b) for the Borrower's general corporate purposes
or to provide working capital for the Borrower (such Advances, "Working Capital
Advances"); or (c)(i) to pay amounts due under Commercial Paper issued by the
Borrower (A) to finance or refinance Project Costs (including to repay CP
Advances used to pay amounts due under Commercial Paper issued to finance or
refinance Project Costs) with respect to any Project up to the CP Commitment
Reservation(s) previously established for such Project, (B) for the Borrower's
general corporate purposes or to provide working capital for the Borrower up to
the CP Commitment Reservation(s) previously established for such purpose, and/or
(C) to allow the Borrower, as permitted under this Agreement, to make a
Restricted Payment or to repay Affiliate Subordinated Debt up to the CP
Commitment Reservation(s) previously established for such purpose; or (ii) to
pay amounts due or owing under Affiliate Subordinated Debt issued to repay
Commercial Paper issued by the Borrower up to the CP Commitment Reservation(s)
previously established in connection with such Commercial Paper (any of such
Advances under subparagraphs (c)(i) and (c)(ii), "CP Advances").

transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have received notice from such
Lender prior to the Amendment Effective Date (in the case of Section 3.01) or

     Group Member of each Material Document to which it is or is to be a party
     (including, with respect to any applicable PPA Document, the assignment of
     rights to, and the assumption of liabilities by, such Borrower Group Member
     thereunder) and the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly
     authorized by all necessary action and do not (i) contravene its
     certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar constitutive or
     governing documents); or (ii) conflict with or contravene any Law to which
     it or any of its Assets are subject which has had or would reasonably be
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect as to the Borrower.

(d)  Governmental Approval. No authorization or approval or other action by, and
     no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required for the
     due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Loan

     Notice of Utilization has been issued by the Borrower, no authorization or
     approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any
     Governmental Authority is then required for the due execution, delivery and
     performance by each Borrower Group Member of the PPA Documents relating to
     such Project and to which it is or is to be a party, or the transactions
     contemplated thereby, except for those which have been duly obtained or

         valid and binding obligation of each Borrower Group Member party
         thereto, enforceable against the Borrower Group Member party thereto in
         accordance with their respective terms, subject to Laws affecting the
         enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to general principles of
         equity.

(f)      No Violation. The execution, delivery and performance by each Borrower
         Group Member of each Material Document to which it is a party do not
         violate, in a manner which has had or would reasonably be expected to
         have a Material Adverse Effect as to the Borrower, any agreement
         binding on it.

(g)      No Default. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing, other than any Default or Event of Default which has been
         waived.

(h)      Litigation. No litigation, arbitration or administrative proceeding is
         currently pending or, to the Borrower's knowledge, threatened against
         any Borrower Group Member (i) to restrain the entry by such Borrower
         Group Member into, the enforcement of, or exercise of any rights by the
         Lenders or the Agent under, or the performance or compliance by such
         Borrower Group Member with any obligations under, any Material Document
         to which it is a party; (ii) which has had or would reasonably be
         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) which purports to
         affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any such Material
         Document or the transactions contemplated thereby.

(i)      Financial Condition. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
         Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2002,
         heretofore furnished to the Lenders, fairly presents in all material
         respects the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its
         consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date in accordance with GAAP.

(j)      Material Adverse Change. There has been no change in the business,

         has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
         Effect as to the Borrower.

(k)      Taxes. There has been no matter with respect to payment of taxes or
         filing of tax returns which has had or would reasonably be expected to
         have a Material Adverse Effect as to the Borrower.

         Subsidiaries is an "investment company" registered or required to be
         registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or is
         a company "controlled" by an "investment company", in each case, as
         such terms are defined in such Act.

(m)      Environmental Matters. To the knowledge of the Borrower, there has been
         no matter with respect to environmental compliance which has had or
         would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect as to
         the Borrower.

(n)  Accuracy of Information. To the knowledge of the Borrower (i) the
     Information Memorandum (other than the projections included therein) was
     complete and correct in all material respects on and as of the date
     thereof; and (ii) all financial projections contained in the Information
     Memorandum were prepared in good faith and based upon assumptions which
     management of the Borrower believed to be not unreasonable at the time the
     projections were prepared (it being understood that (A) such projections
     are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which
     are beyond the Borrower's control; (B) no assurance can be given that the
     projections will be realized; and (C) no representation or warranty can be
     made as to the accuracy of such projections).

(o)      Affiliate Transactions. All transactions between a Borrower Group
         Member and an Affiliate thereof are on arm's-length terms or are "at
         cost", in each case, in accordance with PUHCA or applicable rules and
         regulations issued pursuant thereto.

         respect to any Plan; (ii) no Plan has an accumulated funding deficiency
         determined under Section 412 of the Code; (iii) no proceedings have
         been instituted or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, planned to
         terminate any Plan; (iv) neither the Borrower, nor any member of a
         Controlled Group, nor any duly appointed administrator of a Plan has
         instituted or intends to institute proceedings to withdraw from any
         Multiemployer Pension Plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA); and
         (v) each Plan has been maintained and funded in all material respects
         in accordance with its terms and with the provisions of ERISA
         applicable thereto.

(q)  PUHCA and FPA. The Borrower is an "electric utility company" (as defined in
     PUHCA). No authorization or approval by, or notice to or filing with, any
     Governmental Authority is required for (i) the acquisition of each Project
     by a Borrower Group Member, other than those which, on or prior to the
     first Utilization with respect to such Project, have been duly obtained or
     made and are in full force and effect; or (ii) the issuance of the Notes,
     the incurrence of the Debt contemplated under this Agreement and the
     borrowing, repayment and reborrowing of the Advances, other than those
     which have been duly obtained or made and are in full force and effect. All
     necessary rate schedules are on file and effective with the Federal Energy
     Regulatory Commission for the Borrower Group Members to sell power at
     wholesale. The Borrower reasonably believes that timely interconnection
     agreements for the Projects will be available in the ordinary course.

(r)      No Subsidiary. The Borrower has not had any Subsidiaries on or prior to
         the Amendment Effective Date other than Southern Company-Florida LLC

         to all real property necessary for, or material to, the development,
         ownership, operation and maintenance of the Projects and which is not
         leased by it, each Borrower Group Member has such title as a reputable
         title company doing business in the state in which such real property
         is located would insure, subject to such exceptions as would not
         materially affect the contemplated use of such property by such
         Borrower Group Member, and with respect to all such real property which
         is leased by a Borrower Group Member, such lease is the legal, valid
         and binding obligation of the lessor thereof, enforceable in accordance
         with its terms.

                  unpaid or any Lender shall have any Commitment under this
                  Agreement, the Borrower will:

(a)  Ratio of Recourse Debt to Recourse Capital. At the end of each fiscal
     quarter (including the fourth fiscal quarter) of the Borrower for which
     financial statements have most recently been delivered to the Agent by the
     Borrower pursuant to Section 5.01(d) or (e), cause the ratio of Recourse
     Debt to Total Capitalization to be not more than 0.65:1:00 (65%),
     calculated as of the date of such financial statements; provided that at

     Subordinated Debt made to the Borrower within forty-five (45) days after
     the end of such fiscal quarter, net of Restricted Payments made by the
     Borrower during such 45-day period, shall be taken into account in
     calculating Total Capitalization as at the end of such fiscal quarter; and
     (ii) if any such capital contribution or Affiliate Subordinated Debt is
     made to the Borrower and included for such calculation, the incurrence or
     repayment, if any, of Debt during such 45-day period, shall also be taken
     into account in calculating Recourse Debt as at the end of such fiscal
     quarter; provided further that until such time ---------------- as the
     Franklin 3 Plant meets the conditions precedent that would entitle such
     Plant to become a Subsequent Project under this Agreement, an amount of
     equity and/or Affiliate Subordinated Debt equal to any capital costs paid
     or incurred by the Borrower with respect to the acquisition and
     construction of the Franklin 3 Plant shall not be included in the
     calculation of the ratio of Recourse Debt to Total Capitalization under
     this Section 5.01(a).

     Subsidiary to preserve and maintain, its legal existence as a corporation
     or limited liability company and the rights, licenses, permits, privileges,
     properties and franchises material to its business, except that (i) the

     continuing or surviving Person is the Borrower or is organized under the
     laws of any State of the United States; and (ii) the Borrower may be
     converted into a limited liability company upon giving notice to the Agent
     at least ten (10) Business Days prior to such conversion if such limited
     liability company expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Borrower
     under each Material Document to which it is a party; provided that in each
     case (A) -------- immediately before the consummation of such transaction
     there is no Default or Event of Default; (B) such consummation shall not
     result in a Default or Event of Default; and (C) the resulting Person shall
     have delivered evidence of its due organization, incumbency of officers or
     managers, and unless all of the Borrower's obligations under the Material
     Documents to which the Borrower is a party have been assumed by operation
     of law by such resulting Person, a certified copy of the agreement pursuant
     to which such resulting Person assumes all such obligations, and an opinion
     of counsel, in each case, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, and

     less or, if the Borrower does not have at least an Investment Grade Rating,
     2.25:1.00 or less, in each case, as calculated on a rolling four (4) fiscal
     quarter basis commencing from the first fiscal quarter to commence after
     Substantial Completion is achieved for any Project which, as of the date of
     this Agreement or the date of the first Utilization with respect thereto,
     is an Uncompleted Project and ending on the date of such financial

     Member to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of, any Borrower Group
     Member with any of its officers or directors and with its independent
     certified public accountants from time to time during normal business hours

     representatives (including the examination of records and books and the
     making of copies and abstracts of records and books) at mutually convenient
     times and in such a manner so as to minimize the disruption to the
     operations of the Borrower Group Members and the costs associated with such
     visits.

(k)      Project PPA Documents. Obtain the consent of the Majority Lenders prior
         to any material amendment to, or termination prior to its stated
         expiration by any Borrower Group Member of, any Project PPA Document,

         deductibles or self-insurance retentions as are in accordance with
         normal industry practice; provided that such coverages (and limits and
         deductibles) may be modified due to, but only to the extent of, the
         unavailability of such coverages at commercially reasonable rates or on
         commercially reasonable terms.

         aggregate, $1,000,000, and in any event prior to receipt by any
         Borrower Group Member of such proceeds, establish an account with the
         Agent to hold and disburse such proceeds in accordance with this
         Section 5.01(l).

(iii) Total Loss. Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this
     sub-clause (iii), in the event of a total Loss of any Completed Project

     of insurance (other than business interruption insurance), condemnation
     awards or other recoveries to prepay all outstanding Project Debt
     associated with such Project in accordance with Section 2.09(c), unless the

     Borrower Group Member into the Insurance Account; (2) it will reinstate
     such Project or replace it with a Similar Asset; (3) all conditions
     precedent specified in Sections 3.04(a) through (c) inclusive (but with (x)
     all references to "Borrowing" therein being read and construed as
     references to the first disbursement from the Insurance Account and all
     references therein to "Project" being read and construed as references to
     such Project (in the case of a reinstatement) or such Similar Asset (in the
     case of a replacement); and (y) the certification referred to in Section

     Equity Contributions for such Project or Similar Asset (as the case may be)
     does not exceed the Debt/Equity Ratio applicable thereto, as at the date of
     the first disbursement from the Insurance Account, and after giving effect
     to such disbursement and any Equity Contributions as of the date thereof,
     and the application of proceeds therefrom) are then satisfied with respect
     to the reinstatement or replacement of such Project; (4) there are
     sufficient funds to do so (taking into account all undisputed proceeds to
     be paid and all committed equity contributions into the Borrower); and (5)
     such reinstatement or replacement is technically feasible, then, such
     proceeds may be held in the Insurance Account and disbursed from time to
     time to pay Project Costs for reinstating such Project or for such
     replacement Similar Asset (x) if all conditions precedent specified in
     Section 3.05(a) and (b) (but with (AA) all references to "Borrowing"
     therein being read and construed as references to a disbursement from the
     Insurance Account and all references therein to "Project" being read and
     construed as references to such Project (in the case of a reinstatement) or
     such Similar Asset (in the case of a replacement); and (BB) the
     certification referred to in Section 3.05(b)(iii) certifying instead that
     the ratio of outstanding Debt to Equity Contributions for such Project or
     Similar Asset (as the case may be) does not exceed the Debt/Equity Ratio
     applicable thereto, as at the date of the relevant disbursement from the
     Insurance Account, and after giving effect to such disbursement and any
     Equity Contributions as of the date thereof, and the application of
     proceeds therefrom) are then satisfied; and (y) where the aggregate of all
     such proceeds is less than the Project Costs for such reinstatement or
     replacement (as the case may be), if Project Costs are funded pro rata
     between disbursements from the Insurance Account and Equity Contributions
     to be paid with respect to such reinstatement or replacement. To the extent
     any such proceeds in excess of $1,000,000 are not used for such
     reinstatement or replacement, they shall, upon completion of such
     reinstatement or replacement (as applicable) be applied to prepay the
     outstanding Project Debt made with respect to such Project in accordance
     with Section 2.09(c).

(iv) Partial Loss. In the event of a partial Loss of any Completed Project (with
     respect to which there are Utilizations then outstanding or Commitments
     then available under the Facility), deal with such proceeds of insurance
     (other than business interruption), condemnation awards or other recoveries
     in the following manner: if such proceeds (A) do not exceed $1,000,000 in
     the aggregate with respect to such Loss, apply them at the Borrower's sole
     discretion; (B) exceed $1,000,000 but not $5,000,000 in the aggregate with
     respect to such Loss, use such proceeds to prepay the outstanding Project
     Debt made with respect to such Project in accordance with Section 2.09(c)
     to the extent such proceeds (in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate with
     respect to such Loss) are not used to repair or reinstate such Project,
     upon completion of such repair or reinstatement; (C) exceed $5,000,000 but
     not 10% of the Total Project Costs for such Project with respect to such
     Loss, apply such proceeds to repair or reinstate the affected Project if
     the Borrower certifies to the Agent, within sixty (60) days after receipt
     of proceeds equal to at least $5,000,000 (but with all such proceeds to be
     reserved by the Borrower until such certification is made or until
     prepayment is required pursuant to this Section 5.01(l)(iv)) that (1) it
     will repair or reinstate such Project; (2) there are sufficient funds to do
     so (taking into account all undisputed proceeds to be paid and committed
     equity contributions into the Borrower); and (3) such repairs or
     reinstatements are technically feasible; otherwise, all such proceeds in
     excess of --------- $1,000,000 not used for such repair or reinstatement
     shall, upon completion of such repair or reinstatement, be promptly applied
     to prepay the outstanding Project Debt made with respect to such Project in
     accordance with Section 2.09(c); and (D) exceed 10% of the Total Project
     Costs for such Completed Project, apply such proceeds to repair or
     reinstate the affected Project if consent from the Majority Lenders shall
     have been obtained; otherwise, all such proceeds shall be used promptly to
     prepay --------- the outstanding Project Debt made with respect to such
     Project in accordance with Section 2.09(c).

(m)  Asset Sales. To the extent the Borrower has not reinvested Sale Proceeds
     arising from any Sale in a Similar Asset, by way of the purchase or lease
     (pursuant to a Development Authority Sale/Leaseback) of such Similar Asset,
     within six (6) months after such Sale (any such reinvestment being subject
     to satisfaction of all conditions precedent specified in Sections 3.04(a)
     through (c) inclusive as of the date of the Borrower's initial investment
     in such Similar Asset (but (i) with all references to "Borrowing" therein
     being read and construed as references to such investment and all
     references therein to "Project" being read and construed as references to
     such Similar Asset; and (ii) the certification referred to in Section
     3.04(a)(iii)(A) certifying instead that the ratio of outstanding Debt to
     Equity Contributions for such Similar Asset does not exceed the Debt/Equity
     Ratio applicable thereto, as at the date of such investment, and after
     giving effect to such investment and any Equity Contributions as of the
     date thereof, and the application of proceeds therefrom)), the Borrower
     shall prepay the outstanding Debt under the Facility to the extent required
     under Section 2.09(b)(iii); provided that the Borrower -------- shall be
     permitted to apply all Sale Proceeds remaining thereafter, if any, to make
     a Restricted Payment in accordance with Section 5.02(b).

(n)      Regulatory Approvals. Obtain and maintain, and cause each Relevant
         Subsidiary to obtain and maintain, in full force and effect all
         necessary authorizations and approvals by, and deliver all necessary
         notices to and undertake all necessary filings with, each Governmental
         Authority which are required, in each case, for the Borrower and such
         Subsidiary to sell, at wholesale, the entire output of each electric
         generation plant (including the Projects) owned by the Borrower or such
         Subsidiary, as the case may be.

(o)      Initial Projects. As long as an Initial Project is owned, directly or
         indirectly, by the Borrower, own, or procure that a wholly owned
         Subsidiary of the Borrower (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) will
         own, such Project.

(p)  Granting of Benefits under Certain Circumstances. If in connection with
     obtaining a waiver or a curative amendment of a "default" or an "event of
     default" under a document under which any Debt of the Borrower in a
     principal or notional amount equal to or in excess of $50,000,000 is
     outstanding or which evidences any such Debt, any creditor in respect of
     such Debt will obtain any benefit (including collateral security, a
     guarantee or other third-party support and improved financial terms), offer
     to the Lenders the same benefit (including ratable collateral security and
     guarantees and third-party support and comparably improved terms) and, upon
     the acceptance by the Majority Lenders of such offer, cause such benefit to
     be made available to the Lenders concurrently with making such benefit
     available, and on substantially the same terms as it is made available, to
     such other creditor.

(q)      Notice of Change of Investment Grade Rating. Promptly, and in any event
         within ten (10) days, after the Borrower is notified thereof in writing
         by S&P or Moody's (as applicable), or the chief financial officer or
         the treasurer of the Borrower becomes aware of the public announcement
         thereof by S&P or Moody's (as applicable), notify the Agent of either
         (i) any downgrade in the Borrower's Investment Grade Rating by S&P or
         Moody's, as the case may be; or (ii) mention of the Borrower with
         negative implication in "Credit Watch", or the equivalent thereof by
         either of S&P or Moody's.

(r)  Updated Documents. Upon (i) the earlier of the Non-Recourse Date and the
     Refinancing Date for any Project, deliver to the Agent an Adjusted Project
     Budget setting forth Project Costs incurred, as of such date, with respect
     to such Project; and (ii) each Relevant Event, deliver to the Agent an
     updated Independent Market Consultant report with respect to all Relevant
     Completed Plants as at such Relevant Event (including where such Relevant
     Event is a Southern Event of Default or a Buydown Event, all Substantially
     Completed Projects for which a Buydown Amount is to be paid as a result of
     such Relevant Event) based, in the case of each Plant which has then
     achieved (A) Final Completion, on the performance of such Plant, as
     certified by Southern to the Agent for purposes of its Final Completion;
     and (B) Substantial Completion but not Final Completion, on the performance
     of such Plant, as certified by Southern to the Agent for purposes of its
     Substantial Completion, and, in each case, which is verified by the
     Independent Engineer and Environmental Consultant as being consistent with
     the performance (output, heat rate, environmental and permit compliance and
     availability) of such Plant.

(s)      Project Bonds. As long as any Project is owned by a development
         authority created and existing under the laws of the State of Georgia
         and is leased by a Borrower Group Member, hold, or procure that a
         wholly owned Subsidiary of the Borrower shall hold, free and clear of
         any Liens, all legal and beneficial title to all Project Bonds issued
         with respect to a Development Authority Sale/Leaseback of such Project.

SECTION 5.02. Negative Covenants. So long as any Advance shall remain unpaid or
any Lender shall have any Commitment under this Agreement, the Borrower will
not:

(a)  Debt. Incur, and will not permit any Subsidiary of the Borrower to incur,
     any Debt other than (i) Recourse Debt under the Facility; (ii) Recourse
     Debt the proceeds of which (after customary transaction fees and costs) are
     applied to the concurrent repayment of Debt; (iii) if the Borrower has at
     least an Investment Grade Rating and such rating of the Borrower is
     reaffirmed after incurrence of such other Debt, Recourse Debt or, in the
     case of Lease Obligations, Debt of the related lessor, that has been rated
     at least "Baa3" by Moody's and "BBB-" by S&P; (iv) Recourse Debt the
     repayment in full of which is guaranteed by Southern or another Affiliate
     which has at least an Investment Grade Rating; (v) Debt that is incurred by

     to in Section 5.02(c)(iv), (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), (x), (xvi) or (xvii)

     Borrower will ensure that no Relevant Subsidiary which owns or leases a

     Commitments are then available, shall incur any Debt, other than Debt
     referred to in clause (vi) above.

(b)  Restricted Payments. (i) Declare or make any Restricted Payment; (ii) make

     redeem or otherwise acquire for value any shares of any class of capital
     stock of the Borrower or any warrants, rights or options to acquire any

     (except for any purchase, redemption or acquisition of such shares held by
     Southern or any reduction of capital paid to an Affiliate of the Borrower
     from insurance proceeds for casualties which have been restored with the

     the Borrower's general corporate purposes or to provide working capital for
     the Borrower (including interest, fees and other charges, if any, paid with
     respect to such Affiliate Subordinated Debt to the extent that the same
     does not exceed the maximum rate or amount permitted under PUHCA (whether
     or not such law is repealed)); and provided further, that the Borrower
     -------- ------- may (A) declare and make any Restricted Payment payable in
     common stock of the Borrower; (B) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
     shares of its common stock or warrants, rights or options to acquire any
     such shares with the proceeds received from the substantially concurrent
     contribution to the Borrower's capital or the issue of new shares of the
     Borrower's common stock; and (C) make any payments with respect to
     Affiliate Subordinated Debt (other than Affiliate Subordinated Debt
     referenced to in the preceding proviso), make any redemption or repurchase

     (4) fiscal quarters have ended, such lesser number of fiscal quarters and
     with effect from the date of such delivery of such financial statement) and
     (2) either (x) the percentage derived from dividing Contracted Operating
     Cash Flow by Total Operating Cash Flow is at least 80% or (y) the

         any Unrestricted Subsidiary shall not be so restricted.

(e)      Acquisitions. Acquire, and will ensure that no Relevant Subsidiary will

         substantially as favorable as would be obtainable in a comparable
         arm's-length transaction with a Person other than an Affiliate.

Article VI

                                EVENTS OF DEFAULT

SECTION 6.01.     Events of Default.  If any of the following events ("Events of
                  Default") shall occur and be continuing:

(a)      Payments. The Borrower shall fail to pay (i) any principal of any
         Advance when the same becomes due and payable; or (ii) any interest on
         any Advance or any fees or other amounts payable under this Agreement
         within five (5) Business Days after the same becomes due and payable;
         provided that failure to pay any principal, interest or other amounts
         required under Section 2.09(b)(i) shall not constitute a default by the
         Borrower or an Event of Default unless such failure is still continuing
         as of the Final Maturity Date, whereupon it shall, on such date, become
         an Event of Default; or

(b)      Representations and Warranties. Any representation or warranty made by
         the Borrower in this Agreement shall prove to have been materially
         incorrect when made and, if the underlying facts or circumstances
         making such representation or warranty incorrect are susceptible of
         cure, it shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after
         written notice thereof has been given by the Agent to the Borrower (or
         such longer period as the Majority Lenders may permit); or

(c)      Covenants. The Borrower shall fail to perform or comply with (i)
         Section 5.01(g); or (ii) any other material term, covenant or agreement
         contained in this Agreement on its part to be performed or observed and
         such failure under clause (ii) shall remain unremedied for thirty (30)
         days after written notice thereof has been given by the Agent to the
         Borrower (or such longer period as the Majority Lenders may permit); or

(d)  Cross-default. The Borrower or any Relevant Subsidiary shall fail to pay
     any principal of, or premium or interest on, any of its Debt that is
     outstanding in a principal or notional amount equal to or in excess of
     $50,000,000, in the aggregate, for all such unpaid Debt (but excluding Debt
     outstanding under the Facility) when such Debt becomes due and payable
     (whether by scheduled maturity, required prepayment, acceleration, demand
     or otherwise), and such failure shall continue after the applicable grace
     period, if any, specified in the agreement or instrument relating to such
     Debt; or any other event shall occur or condition shall exist under the
     agreement or instrument relating to any such Debt and shall continue after
     the applicable grace period, if any, specified in such agreement or
     instrument, if the effect of such event or condition is to accelerate the
     maturity of such Debt by reason of default; or any such Debt shall be
     declared due and payable, or be required to be prepaid or redeemed (other
     than by a regularly scheduled required prepayment or redemption), purchased
     or defeased, or an offer to prepay, redeem, purchase or defease such Debt
     shall be required to be made, in each case, prior to the scheduled maturity
     thereof by reason of default; or

(e)      Judgment. Any judgment or order for the payment of money in excess of
         $50,000,000, in the aggregate, shall be rendered against the Borrower
         and the Relevant Subsidiaries and there shall be any period of thirty
         (30) consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such
         judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall
         not be in effect; or

(f)  Bankruptcy, Etc. The Borrower or any Relevant Subsidiary shall (i) apply

     controvert in a timely and appropriate manner, or acquiesce in writing to,
     any petition filed against it in an involuntary case under the U.S.
     Bankruptcy Code or any similar law of any applicable jurisdiction; or a
     proceeding or case shall be commenced, without the application or consent
     of the Borrower or any of its Relevant Subsidiaries, in any court of
     competent jurisdiction, seeking (A) its liquidation, reorganization,
     dissolution or winding-up, or the composition or readjustment of its debts;
     (B) the appointment of a trustee, receiver, custodian, liquidator or the
     like of the Borrower or such Relevant Subsidiary (as applicable) or of all

         Borrower; or (ii) sufficient shares of the capital stock of the
         Borrower to elect a majority of the board of directors of the Borrower;
         or

(h)      Credit Agreement. Any material provision of this Agreement shall fail
         to be in full force and effect, or the Borrower so asserts in writing;

then, and in any such event, the Agent (i) shall at the request, or may with the
consent, of the Majority Lenders, by notice to the Borrower, declare the
obligation of each Lender to make Advances or establish CP Commitments to be
terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate; and/or (ii) shall at
the request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Lenders, by notice to the
Borrower, declare the Advances and the Notes, all interest thereon and all other
amounts payable under this Agreement to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon

and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or
further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Borrower; provided that in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order
for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (A)
the obligation of each Lender to make Advances or establish CP Commitments shall
automatically be terminated; and (B) the Advances and the Notes, all such
interest and all such amounts shall automatically become and be due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.

Article VII

                                    THE AGENT

SECTION 7.01. Authorization and Action. Each Lender hereby appoints and
authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise
such powers and discretion under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as
are delegated to the Agent by their respective terms, together with such powers
and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto and further authorizes the
Agent to execute that certain Letter Amendment No. 1 to Completion Guarantee and
that certain Letter Amendment No. 1 to Equity Contribution Agreement, each to be
dated as of the date hereof and each among the Borrower, Southern and the Agent.
As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or any other Loan
Document (including enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Agent shall not
be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required
to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or
refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority Lenders, and such
instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of Notes;
provided that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that exposes
the Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents or applicable Law. The Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt
notice of each notice given to it by any Loan Party pursuant to the terms of the
relevant Loan Document.

SECTION 7.02. Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to
be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation to the generality of the foregoing, the Agent:
(a) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Agent
receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by the Lender
that is the payee of such Note, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as
assignee, as provided in Section 8.07; (b) may consult with legal counsel
(including counsel for the Borrower), independent public accountants and other
experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted
to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel,
accountants or experts; (c) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender
and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties or
representations (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any PPA Document; (d) shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of
the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any other Material
Document on the part of the Borrower or Southern or any other party thereto, or
to inspect the property (including the books and records) of the Borrower or
Southern; (e) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this
Agreement or any other Material Document or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; and (f) shall incur no liability under or
in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon any
notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by
telecopier, telegram or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent
by the proper party or parties.

SECTION 7.03. Citibank and Affiliates. With respect to its Commitment, the
Advances made by it and the Note issued to it, Citibank shall have the same
rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such
rights and powers as though it were not the Agent; and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Citibank in its
individual capacity. Citibank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking
engagements from, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the
Borrower, Southern, any of their respective Subsidiaries and any Person who may
do business with, or own securities of, the Borrower, Southern or any such
Subsidiary, all as if Citibank were not the Agent and without any duty to
account therefor to the Lenders.

SECTION 7.04. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any Arranger or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and
such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, any Arranger or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document.

SECTION 7.05. Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent (to the
extent not reimbursed by the Borrower), ratably according to the respective
principal amounts of the Notes then held by each of them (or if no Notes are at
the time outstanding or if any Notes are held by Persons that are not Lenders,
ratably according to the respective amounts of their Commitments), from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the
Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document (collectively, the "Indemnified Costs"); provided that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of the Indemnified Costs resulting from
the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided further that no
Designated Lender shall be liable for any payment under this Section 7.05 so
long as, and to the extent that, its Designating Lender makes such payment.
Without limitation to the generality of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to
reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any
out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Material Document or any other
instrument or agreement furnished pursuant hereto or thereto, to the extent that
the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower. In the case of
any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified
Costs, this Section 7.05 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by the Agent, any Lender or a third party.

SECTION 7.06. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and may be removed at any
time with or without cause by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such resignation or
removal, the Borrower shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent, subject
to the approval of the Majority Lenders, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Borrower and approved by the Majority Lenders, and shall have accepted such
appointment, within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice
of resignation or the Majority Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the
retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent subject
to the approval of the Borrower and the Majority Lenders, such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, which shall be a commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United States or of any State thereof and having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Agent under this Section 7.06 by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the
retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. After any retiring Agent's resignation
or removal under this Section 7.06 as Agent, the provisions of this Article VII
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 8.01. Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document, nor consent to any departure by
the Borrower or Southern therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be in writing and signed by or on behalf of the Borrower (and, in the
case only of the Southern Completion Guarantee and the Southern Equity
Agreement, Southern) and the Majority Lenders, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose
for which given; provided that:

(c)      no amendment (other than an amendment to extend its provisions, in
         accordance with the terms thereof, to a Subsequent Project), waiver or
         consent shall, unless in writing and signed by or on behalf of the
         Borrower, Southern and the Required Lenders (or, all of the Lenders
         with respect to any matters relating to those matters expressly
         referred to in subsection (a) above), be made to or given under the
         Southern Completion Guarantee or the Southern Equity Agreement; and

(d)      no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by

         action, affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement,
         any Note or any other Loan Document.

Each Designating Lender may act on behalf of its Designated Lender with respect
to any rights of its Designated Lender to grant or withhold any amendment,
waiver or consent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or with
respect to the Notes.

SECTION 8.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Lender or the
Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right under this Agreement or

Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by Law.

SECTION 8.04. Costs and Expenses, Etc. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay, upon
demand and presentation to the Borrower of a statement of account, all
reasonable and documented third-party out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, syndication,
administration, modification and amendment of this Agreement, the Notes, the
other Loan Documents and the other documents to be delivered hereunder or
thereunder (including (i) all costs and expenses in connection with due
diligence and syndication (including printing, travel, communication, document
preparation, printing and distribution and bank meetings); (ii) the reasonable
fees and expenses of each of New York special counsel and regulatory counsel for
the Agent (but excluding the Agent's in-house counsel) with respect thereto and
with respect to advising the Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the fees and expenses of
each of the Independent Engineer and Environmental Consultant, the Independent
Insurance Consultant and the Independent Market Consultant). The Borrower
further agrees to pay, upon demand and presentation to the Borrower of a
statement of account, all reasonable and documented third-party out-of-pocket
costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders, if any (including, without
limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel), in connection with the
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of
this Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents and the other documents to
be delivered hereunder and thereunder, including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel for the Agent and the Lenders in connection with the enforcement of
rights under this Section 8.04(a); provided that the Borrower shall be required
to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of only one special counsel and, if
applicable, one regulatory counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties under the
circumstances contemplated by the proviso to Section 8.04(b)(iii).

(b) (i) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each of the Arrangers, the Agent, the
Lenders and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and
agents (each, an "Indemnified Party") from, and hold each of them harmless
against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred
by any of them relating to, or arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents and the actual or proposed use of
the proceeds of the Advances or the consummation of any matter contemplated by
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, including any investigation,
litigation or other proceeding (whether or not any of the Indemnified Parties is
a party thereto) related to the entering into of any Loan Document and, to the
extent provided in this subsection (b), the reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel incurred in connection with any such claim, investigation, litigation or
other proceeding; provided that the Borrower shall not be responsible for any
such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses of any Indemnified Party
to the extent incurred by reason of gross negligence or willful misconduct on
the part of such Indemnified Party.

(ii) The Borrower shall be entitled to participate in any action or proceeding
of which it has been notified by any Indemnified Party except any action or
proceeding brought by or for the benefit of the Borrower, Southern or any
Subsidiary of the Borrower or Southern against an Indemnified Party.

(iii) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of written notice of any
investigation, litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnity is sought
by it under this Agreement, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim is to be
made against the Borrower, notify the Borrower thereof in writing, but the
omission so to notify the Borrower will not relieve the Borrower from (A) any
liability under this Section which it may have to such Indemnified Party except
to the extent the Borrower was prejudiced by such omission; or (B) any liability
other than under this Section. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party and the
Borrower shall consult, to the extent appropriate, with a view to minimizing the
cost to the Borrower of its obligations under this Agreement. In case any
Indemnified Party receives written notice of any investigation, litigation or
proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought by it under this
Agreement and it notifies the Borrower thereof, the Borrower will be entitled to
participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice
delivered to the Indemnified Party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice
from the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties (and, if the Agent or one or
more Lenders are the Indemnified Parties, the Agent and such Lenders shall be
entitled jointly to direct the conduct of their defense); provided that if the
parties against which any loss, claim, damage, expense or liability may arise
under any such investigation, litigation or proceeding include both an
Indemnified Party and the Borrower, Southern or any Subsidiary of the Borrower
or Southern, and such Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that (1)
there may be legal defenses available to it or other Indemnified Parties which
are different from or additional to those available to the Borrower, Southern or
any Subsidiary of the Borrower or Southern, and may conflict therewith; or (2)
if any liability, loss, claim, damage or expense arises out of actions brought
by or for the benefit of the Borrower, Southern or any Subsidiary of the
Borrower or Southern, the Indemnified Parties collectively shall have the right
to select one separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and otherwise to
participate in the defense of such investigation, litigation or proceeding on
behalf of the Indemnified Parties. Upon receipt by the Indemnified Party of
notice from the Borrower of its election to assume the defense of such
investigation, litigation or proceeding and approval by the Indemnified Party of
counsel, the Borrower shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof unless (x) the Indemnified Party shall have employed
such counsel in connection with the assumption of legal defenses in accordance
with the proviso to the preceding sentence; (y) the Borrower shall not have
employed and continued to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party to represent the Indemnified Party within a reasonable time
after notice of commencement of the action; or (z) the Borrower shall have
authorized in writing the employment of separate counsel for the Indemnified
Party at the expense of the Borrower. At the Borrower's request, an Indemnified
Party will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any order adjudicating
or otherwise disposing of any loss, claim, damage or liability resulting from
such investigation, litigation or proceeding for which the Borrower is liable
under this Agreement if such settlement, compromise or consent to entry of any
order (AA) includes a provision unconditionally releasing each Indemnified Party
from and holding each Indemnified Party harmless against all liability in
respect of claims by any releasing party relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Notes and the matters contemplated herein; (BB) does not require
any admission or acknowledgment of culpability or wrongdoing by such Indemnified
Party; and (CC) does not involve performance by, or the payment of money damages
or posting any collateral or bond by, such Indemnified Party. The Borrower shall
not be liable for any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of any
order adjudicating or otherwise disposing of any investigation, litigation or
proceeding effected without its consent.

(c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for its actual and documented
(to the extent practicable) losses (excluding any loss of profit and/or margin),
costs and expenses reasonably incurred by it resulting from any payment or
prepayment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurodollar Rate Advance which
is made on a day other than the last day of the relevant Interest Period or in
an amount other than given in the Borrower's notice of such payment or
prepayment, excluding, however, any such losses, costs and expenses resulting
from a payment or prepayment made more than ninety (90) days prior to demand
being made to the Borrower by such Lender for indemnification. The payment of
such indemnity to a Lender shall be made within thirty (30) days of a demand by
such Lender complying with Section 8.04(d).

(d) Any demand by a Lender for payment under Section 2.02(c), 2.10, 2.13,
8.04(b) or 8.04(c) or under any other indemnity made by the Borrower under this
Agreement shall be made in writing to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent)
and shall be accompanied by a certificate of an officer of the Agent or the
relevant Lender, as may be appropriate, setting forth in reasonable detail the
calculation of the amount demanded.

(e) To the extent permitted by Law, if any Lender notifies the Borrower that
additional amounts will be due under Section 2.10 or that any of the events
outlined in Section 2.11 have occurred, such Lender will, if it determines that
such change is not commercially unreasonable, change its Applicable Lending
Office if as a result of such change such increased costs would not be required
to be so paid or it would not be illegal for such Lender to make, fund or
maintain its Eurodollar Rate Advances. The Borrower will reimburse such Lender
for all reasonable expenses it may incur as a result of complying with this
Section 8.04(e).

(f) If any circumstances arise which result, or such Lender becomes aware of any
circumstances which might result, in the Borrower having to make such
compensation or indemnification or in it becoming illegal for such Lender to
make, fund or maintain such Lender's Eurodollar Rate Advances, such Lender will
promptly notify the Borrower thereof and, in consultation with the Borrower,
such Lender shall take all such steps, if any, as it determines are reasonable
and the Borrower determines are acceptable to mitigate the effect of those
circumstances.

(g) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower or
of the Lenders under this Agreement, the agreements and obligations of the
Borrower contained in Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 8.04 and the obligations of the
Lenders contained in Sections 2.13, 8.04, 8.07(g) and 8.08 shall survive the
payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable under this
Agreement and under the Notes.

SECTION 8.05. Right of Set-off. Upon declaration by the Agent that the Advances
and the Notes are due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01,
each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by
such Lender to, or for the credit or the account of, the Borrower against any
and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement, the Notes held by such Lender and the other Loan Documents, whether
or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement, such Notes
or any other Loan Document and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and
application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
set-off) that such Lender may have.

SECTION 8.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective (other than
Section 2.01 and 2.15, each of which shall only become effective upon
satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01) when it
shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Agent and when the Agent shall
have been notified by the Initial Lenders that such Initial Lenders have
executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns,
except that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder
or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

SECTION 8.07. Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Lender may assign to (i)
one or more Eligible Assignees without the approval of the Borrower or the Agent
in the case of any Eligible Assignee that is already a Lender or an Affiliate of
a Lender, and with the approval of the Borrower (unless an Event of Default or
Default has occurred and is then continuing) and the Agent, in the case of any
other Eligible Assignee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); and (ii) one or more other entities with the approval of the Agent
and, so long as no Event of Default exists, the Borrower, all or a portion of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it);
provided that (A) each such assignment shall be of a pro rata share of each
outstanding Advance made by such Lender and the Commitment and CP Commitment of
such Lender; (B) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying,
percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement; (C) except in the
case of an assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such assignment,
was a Lender or an assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being
assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the
Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall be $10,000,000
or a larger integral multiple of $1,000,000; and (D) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for recording in the
Register, and, if the relevant assignee is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a
Lender, to each of the Agent and the Borrower for its acceptance (provided that
no such acceptance is required (1) from the Borrower or the Agent with respect
to an assignee that is a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender; or (2) from the
Borrower with respect to any other Eligible Assignee while an Event of Default
or Default has occurred and is continuing), an appropriate Assignment and
Acceptance, together with any Note subject to such assignment and a processing
and recordation fee of $3,000 (which shall not be payable by the Borrower). Upon
such execution, delivery, acceptance (if applicable) and recording, from and
after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the
assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent that
rights and obligations under this Agreement have been assigned to it pursuant to
such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement; and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the
extent that rights and obligations under this Agreement have been assigned by it
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be
released from its obligations under this Agreement (other than under Sections
2.13(f), 8.07(g) and 8.08) (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance
covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party to this
Agreement).

(b) If any Lender shall make a demand under Section 8.04(d) for payment in
respect of a claim under Section 2.10 or shall give a notice under Section 2.11
of any unlawfulness or assertion of unlawfulness contemplated by such Section or
any demand shall be made or any amount shall be payable with respect to any
Lender under Section 2.13, the Borrower may, by written notice given to such
Lender within forty-five (45) days of the making by such Lender of such demand
or the giving by such Lender of such notice, require by written notice to such
Lender that such Lender assign, by executing and delivering an Acceptance and
Assignment with such Person as directed by the Borrower (it being understood
that such Lender shall not be obligated to find an assignee), within fifteen
(15) days of the giving by the Borrower of such notice but on at least three (3)
Business Days' notice to one or more Persons in accordance with Section 8.07(a)
such Lender's Commitment and its Advances against payment to such Lender in
immediately available funds of the principal amount of such Advances, all
interest accrued thereon to the date of payment, all fees accrued by such Lender
to the date of payment, any amounts payable to such Lender under Section 8.04(c)
and all other amounts payable hereunder to such Lender.

(c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender
assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each
other and the other parties to this Agreement as follows: (i) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Material Document or the execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other
Material Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto
or thereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the
Borrower, Southern or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or Southern, or the
performance or observance by the Borrower or Southern or any other party of any
of its obligations under any Material Document to which it is a party or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (iii) such assignee
confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of
the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (v) such
assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee or that it is an entity that
has been approved by the Borrower and the Agent to the extent any such approval
is required under Section 8.07(a); (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes
the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers
and discretion under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are
delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such
powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such
assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the
obligations that by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are
required to be performed by it as a Lender.

(d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 8.02 a copy
of each Assignment and Acceptance and each Designation Agreement delivered to
and (if applicable) accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the
names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount
of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender under this Agreement
for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to
time upon reasonable prior notice.

(e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning
Lender and an assignee representing that it is an existing Lender or Affiliate
of a Lender or that it is an entity that has been approved by the Borrower and
the Agent under Section 8.07(a), together with any Note or Notes subject to such
assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been
completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C, (i) accept such
Assignment and Acceptance; (ii) record the information contained therein in the
Register; and (iii) promptly give notice and a copy thereof to the Borrower.
Within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at
its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the
surrendered Note a new Note to such Eligible Assignee or other entity in an
amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has retained a Commitment under this
Agreement, a new Note to the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the
Commitment retained by it under this Agreement. Such new Note or Notes shall be
in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such
surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment
and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A.

(f) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(other than the Borrower or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion of
its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and/or the Note or Notes held by
it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents (including its Commitment) shall remain unchanged; (ii)
such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties to this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents for the performance of such obligations;
(iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (iv) the Borrower, the Agent and
the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents; and (v) no participant under any such participation
shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document, or any consent to any departure
by the Borrower or Southern therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment,
waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or
any fees or other amounts payable under this Agreement, the Notes or any other
Loan Document, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable under this
Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document, in each case to the extent
subject to such participation, or any other matter for which unanimous consent
of the Lenders is required pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document.

(g) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or
proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 8.07, disclose to
the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any
Confidential Information; provided that prior to any such disclosure, the
assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall (if it is not
an existing Lender or Participant) have executed and delivered to such Lender
and to the Borrower a duly authorized confidentiality agreement containing
provisions substantially the same as those of Section 8.08.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender
may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement (including the Advances owing to it and the Note held by
it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

(i) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of the Borrower, designate
not more than one Designated Lender to fund Advances on behalf of such
Designating Lender subject to the terms of this Section 8.07(i), and the
provisions of Sections 8.07(a) through (h) shall not apply to such designation.
No Lender may have more than one Designated Lender at any time. Such designation
may occur either by the execution before the Funds Availability Date of the
signature pages of an Assignment and Acceptance by such Lender and Designated
Lender next to the appropriate "Designating Lender" and "Designated Lender"
captions, or by execution by such parties of a Designation Agreement on or after
the Funds Availability Date; provided that any Lender and its Designated Lender
executing the signature pages of any Assignment and Acceptance as "Designating
Lender" and "Designated Lender", respectively, before the Funds Availability
Date shall be deemed to have executed a Designation Agreement, and shall be
bound by the respective representations, warranties and covenants contained
therein. The parties to each such designation occurring on or after the Funds
Availability Date shall execute and deliver to the Agent and the Borrower a
Designation Agreement. Upon receipt of an appropriately completed Designation
Agreement executed by a Designating Lender and a designee representing that it
is a Designated Lender, the Agent will accept such Designation Agreement and
will give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and the other Lenders, whereupon
(i) the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Designating Lender a
Designated Lender Note payable to the order of the Designated Lender; (ii) from
and after the effective date specified in the Designation Agreement, the
Designated Lender shall become a party to this Agreement with a right to make
Advances on behalf of its Designating Lender pursuant to Section 2.01(c); and
(iii) the Designated Lender shall not be required to make payments with respect
to any obligations in this Agreement except to the extent of excess cash flow of
such Designated Lender which is not otherwise required to repay obligations of
such Designated Lender which are then due and payable; provided that regardless
of such designation and assumption by the Designated Lender, the Designating
Lender shall be and remain obligated to the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders
for each and every of the obligations of the Designating Lender and its related
Designated Lender with respect to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
including any indemnification obligations under Section 7.05, and any sums
otherwise payable to the Borrower by the Designated Lender. Each Designating
Lender, or specified branch or affiliate thereof, shall serve as the
administrative agent of its Designated Lender and shall on behalf of its
Designated Lender: (A) receive any and all payments made for the benefit of such
Designated Lender; and (B) give and receive all communications and notices and
take all actions under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including
votes, approvals, waivers, consents and amendments under or relating to this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Any such notice, communication, vote,
approval, waiver, consent or amendment shall be signed by a Designating Lender,
or specified branch or affiliate thereof, as administrative agent for its
Designated Lender and need not be signed by such Designated Lender on its own
behalf. The Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may rely thereon without any
requirement that the Designated Lender sign or acknowledge the same. No
Designated Lender may assign or transfer all or any portion of its interest
under this Agreement, other than via an assignment to its Designating Lender or
Liquidity Lender, if any, or otherwise in accordance with the provisions of
Sections 8.07(a) through (h).

(j) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including any
other provision regarding assignments, participations, transfers or novations),
any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may, without the consent of any other party
hereto, grant to a special purpose vehicle (whether a corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, trust or otherwise, an "SPV") sponsored or managed by
the Granting Lender or any Affiliate thereof, a participation in all or any part
of any existing or future Advances hereunder (including Commitments therefor)
that such Granting Lender has made or will make pursuant to this Agreement;
provided that (i) such Granting Lender's obligations under this Agreement
(including its Commitments) shall remain unchanged; (ii) such Granting Lender
shall remain the holder of the Notes for all purposes under this Agreement; and
(iii) the Borrower, Agent and other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Granting Lender in connection with such Granting Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Each party hereto hereby agrees
that (A) no SPV will be entitled to any rights or benefits that a Participant
would not otherwise be entitled to under this Agreement; and (B) an SPV may
assign its interest in any existing or future Advances under this Agreement to
any Person that would constitute a Participant. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Granting Lender and any SPV may, without the
consent of any other party to this Agreement, and without limiting any other
rights of disclosure of the Granting Lender under this Agreement, disclose on a
confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of
Advances to (1) (in the case of the Granting Lender) any actual or prospective
SPV, (2) (in the case of an SPV) its lenders, sureties, reinsurers, guarantors
or credit liquidity enhancers, (3) their respective directors, officers, and
advisors, and (4) any rating agency.

SECTION 8.08. Confidentiality. (a) Neither the Agent, any Arranger nor any
Lender may, without the prior written consent of the Borrower, disclose to any
Person (i) any confidential, proprietary or non-public information of the
Borrower furnished to the Agent, the Arrangers or the Lenders by the Borrower
(such information being referred to collectively herein as the "Confidential
Information") or (ii) the fact that the Confidential Information has been made
available or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to the
Confidential Information, in each case except as permitted by Section 8.07(d) or
(g) or this Section 8.08 and except that each of the Agent, each of the
Arrangers and each of the Lenders may disclose Confidential Information (i) to
its and its Affiliates' employees, officers, directors, agents and advisors
(collectively, "Representatives") who need to know the Confidential Information
for the purpose of administering or enforcing its rights under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby or for the discharge of their duties (it being understood that the
Representatives to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the
confidential nature of such Confidential Information and instructed to keep such
Confidential Information confidential on substantially the same terms as
provided herein), (ii) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority
having jurisdiction over it or to the extent necessary for purposes of enforcing
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (iii) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (iv)
to any other party to this Agreement, (v) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 8.08, to
any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant
in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement including, in the case
of any securitization or collateralization of, or other similar transaction
relating to, its Commitments by any Lender, disclosure to any necessary Person
in connection with such securitization, collateralization or other transaction
(including any funding vehicle organized to undertake or effectuate such
securitization, collateralization or other transaction, its lenders, sureties,
reinsurers, swap counterparties, guarantors or credit liquidity enhancers, their
respective directors, officers, and advisors, and any rating agency) so long as
the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such Confidential Information and such Persons have agreed in writing
(or with respect to any rating agency, in writing or otherwise) to keep such
Confidential Information confidential on substantially the same terms as
provided herein, and (vii) to the extent such Confidential Information (A) is or
becomes generally available to the public on a non-confidential basis other than
as a result of a breach of this Section 8.08 by the Agent, such Arranger or such
Lender, or (B) is or becomes available to the Agent, such Arranger or such
Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower and
(viii) with the consent of the Borrower.

(b) Neither the Agent, any Arranger nor any Lender shall, without the prior
written consent of the Borrower, use, either directly or indirectly, any of the
Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any of the parties hereto may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. tax treatment and U.S.
tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax
analyses) that are provided to such parties relating to such U.S. tax treatment
and U.S. tax structure.

(d) In the event that the Agent, any Arranger or any Lender becomes legally
compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information otherwise than as
contemplated by Section 8.08(a), the Agent, such Arranger or such Lender shall
provide the Borrower with notice of such event promptly upon its obtaining
knowledge thereof (provided that it is not otherwise prohibited by Law from
giving such notice) so that the Borrower may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is
not obtained, the Agent, such Arranger or such Lender shall furnish only that
portion of the Confidential Information that it is legally required to furnish
and shall cooperate with the Borrower's counsel to enable the Borrower to obtain
a protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded the Confidential Information.

(e) In the event of any breach of this Section 8.08, the Borrower shall be
entitled to equitable relief (including injunction and specific performance) in
addition to all other remedies available to it at Law or in equity.

(f) Neither the Agent, any Arranger nor any Lender shall make any public
announcement, advertisement, statement or communication regarding the Borrower,
its Affiliates (insofar as such announcement, advertisement, statement or
communication relates to the Borrower or the transactions contemplated hereby)
or this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
written consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

(g) Any Designated Lender may disclose any Confidential Information to any
rating agency, commercial paper dealer, Liquidity Lender, sureties, reinsurers,
guarantors or credit liquidity enhancers for or to such Designated Lender, and
their respective directors, officers and advisors; provided that each of such
Persons is informed by the Designated Lender of the confidential nature of the
Confidential Information and each such commercial paper dealer, Liquidity
Lender, surety, reinsurer, guarantor or credit liquidity enhancer agrees to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Section 8.08 to the same extent as the
Designated Lender.

(h) The obligations of the Agent, each Arranger and each Lender under this
Section 8.08 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.09. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York.

SECTION 8.10. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties to this Agreement in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

SECTION 8.11. Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to
the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, New York County, United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and any appellate
court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the Notes, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the
extent permitted by Law, in such federal court. Each of the parties to this
Agreement agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
right that any party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the Notes in the courts of any jurisdiction.

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes
in any New York State or federal court. Each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court.

SECTION 8.12. No Bankruptcy Proceedings. Each of the Borrower, the Lenders and
the Agent agrees that it will not institute against any Designated Lender or
join any other Person in instituting against any Designated Lender any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding
under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day
after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by
such Designated Lender.

SECTION 8.13. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Borrower, the Agent and the
Lenders hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan
Document or the actions of the Agent or any Lender in the negotiation,
administration, performance or enforcement of any such document.

SECTION 8.14. Notes and Loan Documents. Each of the Borrower, the Lenders and
the Agent agrees that the Notes and each of the other Loan Documents are and
shall continue to be in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and
confirmed in all respects. The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this
Agreement shall not, except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of
any right, power or remedy of any Lender or the Agent under any of the Loan
Documents, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of any of the Loan
Documents. On and after the effectiveness of this Agreement, each reference in
each exhibit, schedule, supplement or attachment to the Original Credit
Agreement to "this Agreement," "hereunder," "hereof" or words of like import
referring to the Original Credit Agreement, and each reference in the Notes and
each of the other Loan Documents and in each exhibit, schedule, supplement or
attachment thereto to "the Credit Agreement," "thereunder," "thereof" or words
of like import referring to the Original Credit Agreement, shall mean and be a
reference to this Agreement, as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time.

"Agreement"), [describe the specific Affiliate Subordinated Debt that is being
subordinated hereby -- to include all amounts payable in connection therewith],
which constitutes debt of the Borrower originally issued to a Person that is an
Affiliate of the Borrower and which is subordinated on the terms set forth
below. Debt of the Borrower payable to any entity that is formed by the Borrower
or an Affiliate of the Borrower for the purpose of issuing securities in the
public or capital markets, or in a private placement, shall not constitute
"Affiliate Subordinated Debt" for all purposes hereof.

                  SECTION 2. Agreement to Subordinate. The holder hereof (the
"Subordinated Creditor") and the Borrower each agree that the Affiliate
Subordinated Debt is and shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment,
to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, to the prior payment in
full of all obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under (a) the
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2003, as from time
to time in effect (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Borrower, the financial
institution(s) party thereto and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for such financial
institution(s), and any promissory notes (the "Notes") issued pursuant thereto
and (b) such documents as may be listed on Schedule I hereto on the date of
execution hereof or from time to time added to said Schedule I (other than any
such document which the Senior Creditors (as hereinafter defined) thereunder
have agreed may be deleted from said Schedule I from time to time) by a writing
signed by the Borrower and the Subordinated Creditor (such documents being
referred to herein collectively as the "Senior Debt Documents"), whether for
principal, interest (including, without limitation, interest, as provided in the
Notes and in the debt instruments included in the Senior Debt Documents (such
debt instruments included in the Senior Debt Documents being referred to herein
collectively as the "Senior Debt Instruments"), accruing after the filing of a
petition initiating any proceeding referred to in Section 3(a), whether or not
such interest accrues after the filing of such petition for purposes of the
Federal Bankruptcy Code or is an allowed claim in such proceeding), fees,
expenses, indemnity or other amounts due thereunder (such obligations of the
Borrower under the Credit Agreement and the Senior Debt Documents being the
"Obligations"). For the purposes of this Agreement, the Obligations shall not be
deemed to have been paid in full until (i) with respect to the Lenders, the
earlier of (A) the Final Maturity Date, and (B) the date of termination in whole
of each Lender's commitment (the "Termination Date") under the Credit Agreement
shall have occurred and (ii) with respect to each Senior Creditor, the
obligation under each of its respective Senior Debt Documents to extend credit,
disburse funds or acquire a debt instrument shall have terminated and unless the
Lenders, the creditors under the Senior Debt Documents and the holders (other
than the Lenders) of the Senior Debt Instruments (such creditors and holders
being referred to collectively herein as the "Senior Creditors") shall have
received payment of their respective Obligations in full in cash. The Borrower
and the Subordinated Creditor shall endorse on any instrument evidencing
Affiliate Subordinated Debt a statement to the effect that it is subject to
these terms of subordination.

                  SECTION 3. Events of Subordination. (a) In the event of any
dissolution, winding up, liquidation, arrangement, reorganization, adjustment,
protection, relief or composition of the Borrower or its debts, whether
voluntary or involuntary, in any bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement,
reorganization, receivership, relief or other similar case or proceeding under
any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law or upon an assignment for the
benefit of creditors or any other marshaling of the assets and liabilities of
the Borrower or otherwise, the Lenders and the Senior Creditors shall be
entitled to receive payment in full of their respective Obligations before the
Subordinated Creditor is entitled to receive any payment of all or any of the
Affiliate Subordinated Debt, and any payment or distribution of any kind
(whether in cash, property or securities) that otherwise would be payable or
deliverable upon or with respect to the Affiliate Subordinated Debt in any such
case, proceeding, assignment or marshaling (including any payment that may be
payable by reason of any other Debt of the Borrower being subordinated to
payment of the Affiliate Subordinated Debt) shall be paid or delivered directly
to Citibank, as Agent under the Credit Agreement, for the account of the
Lenders, and to the Senior Creditors or to a trustee or other agent for the
Senior Creditors or for any group of the Senior Creditors (any such trustee or
agent being referred to herein as a "Representative") which may be listed on
Schedule I hereto, pro rata according to the principal amount of the Obligations
then owed by the Borrower to each of the Lenders and the Senior Creditors, for
application (in the case of cash) to, or as collateral (in the case of non-cash
property or securities) for, the payment or prepayment of the Obligations until
the Obligations shall have been paid in full.

                  (b) In the event that (i) any Default or Event of Default
described in Section 6.01 of the Credit Agreement or any payment default by the
Borrower under a Senior Debt Document shall have occurred and be continuing,
(ii) any Event of Default or any "event of default" under a Senior Debt Document
that would entitle the creditors under such Senior Debt Document to accelerate
the maturity of indebtedness evidenced by such Senior Debt Document (a "Senior
Event of Default") (other than as referred to in the preceding clause (i)) shall
have occurred and be continuing or (iii) any judicial proceeding shall be
pending with respect to any Event of Default or Senior Event of Default, then no
payment (including any payment that may be payable by reason of any other Debt
of the Borrower being subordinated to payment of the Affiliate Subordinated
Debt) or distribution of any kind, whether in cash, property or securities,
shall be made by or on behalf of the Borrower for or on account of any Affiliate
Subordinated Debt, and the Subordinated Creditor shall not take or receive from
the Borrower, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off in
any other manner, including, without limitation, from or by way of collateral,
payment of all or any of the Affiliate Subordinated Debt until the Obligations
shall have been paid in full.

                  (c) Until the Termination Date under the Credit Agreement
shall have occurred and the Obligations thereunder then owned by the Borrower to
the Lenders shall have been paid in full in cash, no payment (including any
payment that may be payable by reason of any other Debt of the Borrower being
subordinated to the payment of the Affiliate Subordinated Debt) or distribution
of any kind, whether in cash, property or securities, shall be made by or on
behalf of the Borrower for or on account of any Affiliate Subordinated Debt, and
the Subordinated Creditor shall not take or receive from the Borrower, directly
or indirectly, in cash, property or securities or by set-off or in any other
manner, including, without limitation, from or by way of collateral, payment of
all or any of the Affiliate Subordinated Debt at any time (i) unless at the end
of the fiscal quarter (including the fourth fiscal quarter) of the Borrower for
which financial statements have most recently been delivered to the Agent by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 5.01(d) or (e) of the Credit Agreement on or
preceding the date on which the Borrower takes such action, the ratio of Cash
Available for Corporate Debt Service to Corporate Interest was at least
2.00:1.00 or, if the Borrower does not have at least an Investment Grade Rating,
2.25:1.00, in each case, for the period comprised of the four fiscal quarters
ending on the date of such financial statements and with effect from the date of
delivery of such financial statements; or (ii) with respect solely to Affiliate
Subordinated Debt loaned to the Borrower to pay Project Costs of any Project at
any time prior to the Non-Recourse Date for such Project, if, no more frequently
than once each calendar month, such payment or distribution is made on, or
within three (3) Business Days after, the date of, and using the proceeds of the
Project Advances or Commercial Paper (as applicable) arising from, or relating
to, a Utilization with respect to such Project; provided, that the amount of
interest, fees and other charges, if any, paid with respect to any Affiliate
Subordinated Debt under this subsection (ii) will not exceed the maximum rate or
amount permitted under PUHCA (whether or not such law is repealed).

     SECTION 4. In Furtherance of Subordination. The Subordinated Creditor
agrees as follows:

                  (a) If any proceeding referred to in Section 3(a) above is
         commenced by or against the Borrower,

                           (i) Citibank, as Agent for the Lenders, and the
                  Senior Creditors, acting directly or through one or more
                  Representatives, are hereby irrevocably authorized and
                  empowered (in their own names or in the name of the
                  Subordinated Creditor or otherwise), but shall have no
                  obligation, to demand, sue for, collect and receive every
                  payment or distribution referred to in Section 3(a) to which
                  they are entitled thereunder and give acquittance therefor and
                  to file claims and proofs of claim and take such other action
                  (including, without limitation, voting the Affiliate
                  Subordinated Debt pro rata according to the principal amount
                  of the Obligations then owed by the Borrower to each of the
                  Lenders and the Senior Creditors or enforcing any security
                  interest or other lien securing payment of the Affiliate
                  Subordinated Debt) as it may deem necessary or advisable for
                  the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights or interests
                  of the Agent, the Lenders, the Representatives and the Senior
                  Creditors hereunder; and

                           (ii) the Subordinated Creditor shall duly and
                  promptly take such reasonable actions as Citibank, as Agent
                  for the Lenders and the Senior Creditors or the
                  Representatives may request (A) to permit Citibank, as Agent
                  of the Lenders, and the Senior Creditors or the
                  Representatives to collect the Subordinated Debt for the
                  account of the Lenders and the Senior Creditors and to file
                  appropriate claims or proofs of claim in respect of the
                  Subordinated Debt, (B) to execute and deliver to Citibank, as
                  Agent for the Lenders, and to the Senior Creditors or their
                  Representatives such documents as Citibank, as Agents for the
                  Lenders and the Senior Creditors or the Representatives may
                  reasonably request in order to enable Citibank, as Agent for
                  the Lenders, and the Senior Creditors or the Representatives
                  to enforce any and all claims with respect to, and any
                  security interest and other liens securing payment of, the
                  Subordinated Debt, and (C) to collect and receive any and all
                  payments or distributions which may be payable or deliverable
                  upon or with respect to the Subordinated Debt, which payments
                  and distributions shall be distributed pro rata according to
                  the principal amount of the Obligations then owed by the
                  Borrower to each of the Lenders and the Senior Creditors.

                  (b) All payments or distributions upon or with respect to the
         Affiliate Subordinated Debt which are received by the Subordinated
         Creditor contrary to the provisions of this Agreement shall be received
         in trust for the benefit of the Lenders and the Senior Creditors pro
         rata according to the principal amount of the Obligations then owed by
         the Borrower to each of the Lenders and the Senior Creditors, shall be
         segregated from other funds and property held by the Subordinated
         Creditor and shall be forthwith paid over to Citibank, as Agent for the
         Lenders, for the account of the Lenders, and to the Senior Creditors or
         their Representatives pro rata according to the principal amount of the
         Obligations then owed by the Borrower to each of the Lenders and the
         Senior Creditors, in the same form as so received (with any necessary
         indorsement) to be applied (in the case of cash) to, or held as
         collateral (in the case of non-cash property or securities) for, the
         payment or prepayment of the Obligations in accordance with the terms
         of the Credit Agreement and the Senior Debt Documents. Any portion of a
         payment or distribution received by a Lender or Senior Creditor (or by
         the Agent or a Representative) which is in excess of its pro rata
         portion of such payment or distribution shall be held in trust by such
         Lender or Senior Creditor (or Agent or Representative) for the benefit
         of the other Lenders and Senior Creditors to be paid promptly to the
         other Lenders and Senior Creditors (or to the Agent and the
         Representatives on behalf of such Lenders and Senior Creditors) pro
         rata according to the principal amount of the Obligations then owed by
         the Borrower to each of such Lenders and Senior Creditors.

                  (c) Citibank, as Agent for the Lenders, and the Senior
         Creditors or their Representatives are hereby authorized to seek
         specific performance of this Agreement, whether or not the Borrower
         shall have complied with any of the provisions hereof applicable to it,
         at any time when the Subordinated Creditor shall have failed to comply
         with any of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to it.

                  SECTION 5. No Commencement of Any Proceeding. The Subordinated
Creditor agrees that, so long as the Obligations shall not have been paid in
full in cash, the Subordinated Creditor will not sue for payment of all or any
of the Affiliate Subordinated Debt, or commence, or join with any creditor other
than the Lenders, Citibank, as Agent for the Lenders, the Senior Creditors and
the Representatives, in commencing any proceeding referred to in Section 3(a);
provided, however, that the foregoing provisions shall not prevent the
Subordinated Creditor from commencing and prosecuting to judgment any action
necessary to enforce such Affiliate Subordinated Debt during the period
commencing one year prior to the expiration of the limitation period governing
such Affiliate Subordinated Debt under any applicable statute of limitations.

                  SECTION 6. Rights of Subrogation. The Subordinated Creditor
agrees that no payment or distribution to Citibank, as Agent for the Lenders,
the Lenders, the Senior Creditors or the Representatives pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement shall entitle the Subordinated Creditor to exercise
any right of subrogation in respect thereof until the Obligations shall have
been paid in full. From and after the payment in full of the Obligations, the
Subordinated Creditor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Agent, the
Lenders, the Senior Creditors and the Representatives to receive any further
payments or distributions applicable to the Obligations until the Affiliate
Subordinated Debt shall have been paid in full, in addition to all other rights
of subrogation that the Subordinated Creditor may have. For purposes of any such
subrogation, no payments or distributions on the Obligations pursuant to this
Agreement shall, as between the Borrower, its creditors other than the Lenders
and the Senior Creditors, and the Subordinated Creditor, be deemed to be a
payment by the Borrower to or on account of the Obligations, and no payments or
distributions to the Subordinated Creditor of assets by virtue of the
subrogation herein provided for shall, as between the Borrower, its creditors
other than the Lenders and the Senior Creditors, and the Subordinated Creditor,
be deemed to be a payment by the Borrower to or on account of the Obligations,
and no payments or distributions to the Subordinated Creditor of assets by
virtue of the subrogation herein provided for shall, as between the Borrower,
its creditors other than the Lenders and the Senior Creditors, and the
Subordinated Creditor, be deemed to be a payment to or on account of the
Affiliate Subordinated Debt. The provisions of this Agreement are and are
intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the
Subordinated Creditor, on the one hand, and the Lenders, the Agent for the
benefit of the Lenders, the Senior Creditors and the Representatives, on the
other hand, and nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to or shall
impair the obligation of the Borrower, which is unconditional and absolute, to
pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Affiliate
Subordinated Debt as and when the same shall become due and payable in
accordance with its terms, or, except as provided in Section 10 below, to affect
the relative rights of the Subordinated Creditor and the creditors of the
Borrower other than the Lenders and the Senior Creditors, nor shall anything
herein prevent the Subordinated Creditor from exercising all remedies otherwise
permitted by applicable law upon default under the Affiliate Subordinated Debt,
subject to the rights, if any, under this Agreement, of the Lenders, the Agent
for the benefit of the Lenders, the Senior Creditor and the Representatives in
respect of cash, property or securities of the Borrower otherwise payable or
delivered to the Subordinated Creditor upon the exercise of any such remedy.

                  SECTION 7. Agreements in Respect of Affiliate Subordinated
Debt. The Subordinated Creditor will not sell, assign, pledge, encumber or
otherwise dispose of any of the Affiliate Subordinated Debt unless such sale,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance or disposition (i) is to an Affiliate of the
Borrower other than a Subsidiary of the Borrower (ii) is made expressly subject
to this Agreement.

                  SECTION 8. Obligations Hereunder Not Affected. All rights and
interest of Citibank, as Agent for the Lenders, the Lenders, the Senior
Creditors and the Representatives hereunder, and all agreements and obligations
of the Subordinated Creditor and the Borrower under this Agreement, shall remain
in full force and effect irrespective of:

                  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit
         Agreement, a Note, a Senior Debt Document or any other agreement or
         instrument relating thereto;

                  (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
         in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other
         amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Credit
         Agreement, a Note or a Senior Debt Document, including, without
         limitation, any increase in the Obligations resulting from the
         extension of additional credit to the Borrower or otherwise;

                  (iii) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any
         collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent
         to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the Obligations;

                  (iv) any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds
         thereof, to all or any of the Obligations, or any manner of sale or
         other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Obligations
         or any other assets of the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries;

                  (v) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
         structure or existence of the Borrower; or

                  (vi) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
         defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or a subordinated
         creditor.

This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may
be, if at any time any payment of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned by Citibank, as Agent for the Lenders, any Lender, any
Senior Creditor or any Representative upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not
been made.

                  SECTION 9. Waiver. The Subordinated Creditor and the Borrower
each hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other
notice with respect to any of the Obligations and this Agreement and any
requirement that Citibank, as Agent for the Lenders, any Lender, any Senior
Creditor or any Representative protect, secure, perfect or insure any security
interest or lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take
any action against the Borrower or any other person or entity or any collateral.

                  SECTION 10. Extension of Subordination. The Borrower and the
Subordinated Creditor shall not subordinate the Affiliate Subordinated Debt for
the benefit of any one or more other creditors of the Borrower, now or hereafter
existing, upon any terms other than those set forth in this Agreement. The
Borrower and the Subordinated Creditor shall have the right to subordinate the
Affiliate Subordinated Debt for the benefit of any one or more other creditors
of the Borrower, now or hereafter existing, upon the same terms as are set forth
in this Agreement.

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED
                                CREDIT AGREEMENT


                               TESTING PROCEDURES

A. COMBINED-CYCLE PROJECTS

Introduction:

The procedures and required tests which must be completed prior to Southern's
certification of Substantial Completion and Final Completion with respect to an
Uncompleted Project which is a combined-cycle electric generation plant are set
forth below. The capacity and heat rate tests for such Project may be conducted
independently; provided that if the Guaranteed Heat Rate and Guaranteed Output
for such Project are based upon the same ambient conditions and operating mode
(e.g., base mode, full pressure and power augmentation), the capacity and heat
rate tests for such Project shall be conducted simultaneously.

The tests will be conducted by the owner according to a test procedure
(incorporating the relevant matters set forth herein) provided by the owner and
approved by Southern Company Services, Inc. ("SCS") and the purchaser of energy
from such Project under each Power Purchase Agreement, if any, applicable
thereto. The test procedure will be based on ASME PTC 46-1996 ("PTC 46"). This
code determines the net electrical output and heat rate of the Project,
corrected to design operating conditions.

The Uncompleted Project shall demonstrate compliance with the air permit limits
during the tests (using certified plant continuous emissions monitoring system
("CEMS"), calibrated portable CEMS, or by certified emissions testing
contractor) and all applicable laws and other permits, with no waivers or
variances for construction, start-up, testing or otherwise.

The tests will encompass a control volume including the cooling tower as shown
in Figure 5.1 of PTC 46. The only essential data required are those parameters
which cross the test boundary. Correction curves will be utilized to correct net
unit performance from test conditions to design conditions.

The tests will be conducted after all required systems are fully commissioned
and at actual ambient and operating conditions as close as practical to design
conditions. Heat recovery steam generator ("HRSG") blowdown will be isolated
during the tests since these flows are unmetered; however, corrections to
account for design flows will be applied. All auxiliary components must be
operated in a normal manner consistent with Prudent Utility Practices. "Prudent
Utility Practices" shall mean at a particular time, any of the practices,
methods and acts engaged in or approved by a significant portion of the United
States electric utility industry as at such time, or any of the practices,
methods and acts which, in the exercise of reasonable judgment in light of the
facts known at the time the decision was made, could have been expected to
accomplish the desired results at a reasonable cost consistent with good
business practices, reliability, safety and expedition. Prudent Utility
Practices is not intended to be limited to the optimum practice, method or act
to the exclusion of all others, but rather to be a spectrum of possible
practices, methods or acts expected to accomplish the desired results, having
due regard for, among other things, manufacturers' warranties and the
requirements of governmental authorities of competent jurisdiction.

Capacity Testing:

Capacity test results will be corrected to the rated conditions (the "Output
Rated Conditions") applicable to the Guaranteed Output for such Project, as set
forth, (a) in the case of an Initial Project, in Schedule IV to the Credit
Agreement; or (b) in the case of a Subsequent Project, in the Project Schedule
delivered pursuant to Section 3.04 of the Credit Agreement for such Project. The
demonstrated net output of the Project will be as measured by the test metering
system and corrected to such Project's Output Rated Conditions. PTC 46
correction curves will be produced by SCS using a GateCycle computer model,
created from design input provided by the equipment vendors. Combustion turbine
evaporative coolers, HRSG ductburners and power augmentation steam injection
will be in service.

Net unit capacity will be corrected from test to design conditions for the
following parameters as required by PTC 46:

Ambient Dry Bulb Temperature Ambient Humidity (or wet bulb temperature)
Barometric Pressure (or elevation) HRSG Blowdown Flow Condenser Makeup Flow and
Temperature Fuel Temperature (upstream of fuel heaters) Power Factor (each
generator) Abnormal Auxiliary Power Loads Abnormal Fuel Properties Abnormal Unit
Operating Conditions

Heat Rate Testing:

Heat rate test results will be corrected to the rated operating conditions (the
"Heat Rate Rated Conditions") applicable to the Guaranteed Heat Rate for such
Project, as set forth, (a) in the case of an Initial Project, in Schedule IV to
the Credit Agreement; or (b) in the case of a Subsequent Project, in the Project
Schedule delivered pursuant to Section 3.04 of the Credit Agreement for such
Project. The demonstrated net heat rate of the Project will be as measured by
the test metering system and corrected to such Project's Heat Rate Rated
Conditions. PTC 46 heat rate correction curves will be produced by SCS using a
GateCycle computer model, created from design input provided by the equipment
vendors. Combustion turbine evaporative coolers will be in service or
appropriate corrections will be applied. HRSG ductburners and power augmentation
will be out of service.

Net unit heat rate will be corrected from test to design conditions for the
following parameters, as required by PTC 46:

Ambient Dry Bulb Temperature
Ambient Humidity (or wet bulb temperature)
HRSG Blowdown Flow
                  -
Condenser Makeup Flow and Temperature
                                     -
Fuel Temperature (Upstream of fuel heaters)
Power Factor (each generator)
Abnormal Aux. Power Loads
Abnormal Fuel Properties
Abnormal Unit Operating Conditions

Essential Data Requirements:

Test data will be obtained using test instruments which meet the requirements of
PTC 46. Specific methods which will be employed for significant data points are
as follows:

1.       Net power will be determined from the sum of gross combustion turbine
         output and steam turbine output, less station service and main
         transformer losses.

2.       Combustion turbine gross output will be measured using temporary test
         watt meters installed in parallel with station watt meters.

3.       Steam turbine gross output will be measured using temporary test watt
         meters installed in parallel with station watt meters.

4.       Station service will be measured using installed station watt hour
         meters.

5.       Main transformer losses will be calculated from transformer shop test
         data.

6.       Net fuel consumption will be the sum of fuel flow to each combustion
         turbine and the ductburners.

7.       Natural gas flows to each combustion turbine and ductburner will be
         determined using test differential pressure transmitters installed in
         parallel with station instruments across the existing plant orifice
         meter tubes. Test instruments also will be used to measure gas pressure
         and temperatures.

8.       Natural gas flowrates will be calculated using the formulas provided in
         ASME MFC-3M.

9.       Fuel properties will be determined from gas samples taken during each
         test and analyzed by an independent analysis laboratory.

10.      Ambient pressure will be measured using an electronic test barometer
         meeting ASME PTC 22 requirements.

11.      Combustion turbine inlet dry bulb temperatures will be determined by a
         test temperature grid installed in the inlet of each combustion turbine
         unit.

12.      Combustion turbine inlet wet bulb temperature and relative humidity
         will be determined using a test psychrometer in the inlet of each
         combustion turbine unit.

13.      Substitute or temporary plant equipment shall not be used during
         testing, and the Uncompleted Project shall be tested while in an
         "automatic mode" to an extent consistent with normal operating
         practice.

14.      Cooling tower inlet dry and wet bulb temperatures will be determined
         based on dedicated temperature readings near the cooling tower(s).

Test Conditions:

At least two test runs of one hour each will be conducted and compared for
repeatability. The tests will be conducted after all required systems are fully
commissioned and at actual ambient and operating conditions as close as
practical to Output Rated Conditions (in the case of capacity tests) or Heat
Rate Rated Conditions (in the case of heat rate tests). HRSG blowdown will be
isolated during the tests since these flows are unmetered; however, corrections
back to design flows will be applied. If the corrected results of the two test
runs do not agree within 0.25%, then the cause of the discrepancy will be
investigated, eliminated if possible, and a third test performed. If the results
of all tests vary by more than 0.25% from the mean of all tests, then the
results of all three tests will be averaged. If one test varies by more than
0.25% from the mean of the other two tests, then its results will be discarded
and the results of the other two will be averaged.


B.       PEAKER PROJECTS

To be agreed between the Borrower and the Independent Engineer and Environmental
Consultant (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders) with respect to
each Subsequent Project which is a Peaker on or prior to the first Utilization
relating thereto.



                                RELIABILITY TEST

A.       COMBINED-CYCLE PROJECTS

The Borrower will conduct a 7-day reliability test which is intended to
demonstrate that each of the Harris 1 Project, the Harris 2 Project, the
Franklin 1 Project, the Franklin 2 Project and the Wansley Project (and any
other Subsequent Project which is a combined-cycle electric generation plant)
are capable of continuous, reliable operation at various load points. The
reliability test shall be conducted during a continuous 168-hour period during
which the relevant Project shall demonstrate the following requirements:

o        Achieve an Equivalent Availability Factor (as calculated by the North
         American Electric Reliability Council) of at least 97 percent;

o        During such test, the Project shall operate for 124 or more hours at
         the mode of operation applicable to either the Guaranteed Output or the
         Guaranteed Heat Rate for such Project, provided that the Project shall
         operate (a) for at least 24 hours in the mode of operation applicable
         to the Guaranteed Output for such Project, if ambient conditions allow;
         and (b) for at least 6 continuous hours in the mode of operation
         applicable to the Guaranteed Output for such Project;

o        During the reliability test, data will be recorded from plant
         instrumentation at one-hour intervals (ambient conditions recorded
         manually if necessary);

o        All plant emissions shall be recorded by the plant CEMS during the
         reliability test;

o        During the reliability test, the Project shall be operated in
         accordance with prudent utility practice and all laws, permits and
         regulations applicable to such Project (including, without limitation,
         all emissions requirements imposed by the Project's air permit); and

o        The facility controls shall be placed in an "automatic mode" to an
         extent consistent with normal operating practice, and manual control of
         facility equipment and systems shall be minimized. Operating personnel
         shall be staffed consistent with normal operating plans.

                        FORM OF ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE

                  Reference is made to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
dated as of April 17, 2003 (as amended or modified from time to time, the
"Credit Agreement") among SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the
"Borrower"), certain financial institutions parties thereto and CITIBANK, N.A.,
as agent for said financial institutions (the "Agent"). Terms defined in the
Credit Agreement are used herein with the same meaning.

                  The "Assignor" and the "Assignee" referred to on Schedule 1
hereto agree as follows:

1.   The Assignor hereby sells and assigns to the Assignee, and the Assignee
     hereby purchases and assumes from the Assignor, an interest in and to the
     Assignor's rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement as of the date
     hereof equal to the percentage interest specified on Schedule 1 hereto.
     After giving effect to such sale and assignment, the Assignee's Commitment,
     CP Commitment and the amount of the Advances (and Categories thereof) owing
     to the Assignee will be as set forth on Schedule 1 hereto.

2.   The Assignor (i) represents and warrants that it is the legal and
     beneficial owner of the interest being assigned by it hereunder and that
     such interest is free and clear of any adverse claim; (ii) makes no
     representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to
     any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with
     the Credit Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
     genuineness, sufficiency or value of the Credit Agreement or any other
     instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (iii) makes no
     representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to
     the financial condition of the Borrower, Southern or any Subsidiary of the
     Borrower or Southern, or the performance or observance by any of the
     Borrower, Southern or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or Southern, or any
     other party, of any of its obligations under the Credit Agreement and the
     other Material Documents to which it is a party, or any other instrument or
     document furnished pursuant thereto; and (iv) attaches the Note held by the
     Assignor and requests that the Agent exchange such Note for a new Note
     payable to the Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by the
     Assignee pursuant hereto or new Notes payable to the Assignee in an amount
     equal to the Commitment assumed by the Assignee pursuant hereto and the
     Assignor in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by the Assignor
     under the Credit Agreement, respectively, as specified on Schedule 1
     hereto.

3.   The Assignee (i) confirms that it has received a copy of the Credit
     Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in
     Section 4.01 thereof and such other documents and information as it has
     deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter
     into this Assignment and Acceptance; (ii) agrees that it will,
     independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Assignor or any
     other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
     appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
     taking or not taking action under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan
     Documents; (iii) confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee or that it is an
     entity that has been approved by the Borrower and the Agent to the extent
     any such approval is required under Section 8.07(a) of the Credit
     Agreement; (iv) appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as
     agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under the
     Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agent
     by the terms thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are
     reasonably incidental thereto; (v) agrees that it will perform in
     accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of the
     Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents are required to be performed
     by it as a Lender; and (vi) attaches any U.S. Internal Revenue Service
     forms required under Section 2.13 of the Credit Agreement.

4.   Following the execution of this Assignment and Acceptance, it will be
     delivered to the Agent for acceptance and recording by the Agent. The
     effective date for this Assignment and Acceptance (the "Effective Date")
     shall be the date of acceptance hereof by the Agent, unless otherwise
     specified on Schedule 1 hereto.

5.   Upon such acceptance and recording by the Agent, as of the Effective Date,
     (i) the Assignee shall be a party to the Credit Agreement and, to the
     extent provided in this Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
     obligations of a Lender thereunder and (ii) the Assignor shall, to the
     extent provided in this Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights
     and be released from its obligations (other than under Sections 2.13(f),
     8.07(g) and 8.08) under the Credit Agreement.

6.   Upon such acceptance and recording by the Agent, from and after the
     Effective Date, the Agent shall make all payments under the Credit
     Agreement and the Notes in respect of the interest assigned hereby
     (including all payments of principal, interest and commitment fees with
     respect thereto) to the Assignee. The Assignor and Assignee shall make all
     appropriate adjustments in payments under the Credit Agreement and the
     Notes for periods prior to the Effective Date directly between themselves.

7.   This Assignment and Acceptance shall be governed by, and construed in
     accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York.

8.   This Assignment and Acceptance may be executed in any number of
     counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each
     of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of
     which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery
     of an executed counterpart of Schedule 1 to this Assignment and Acceptance
     by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
     counterpart of this Assignment and Acceptance.

                  Reference is made to that certain Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement dated as of April 17, 2003 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") by and among SOUTHERN POWER
COMPANY, the Lenders parties thereto and CITIBANK, N.A., as Agent. Terms defined
in the Credit Agreement are used herein with the same meaning.

                  [NAME OF DESIGNATING LENDER] (the "Designating Lender"), [NAME
OF DESIGNEE] (the "Designee") and the Agent agree as follows:

                  1. Pursuant to Section 8.07(i) of the Credit Agreement, the
         Designating Lender hereby designates the Designee, and the Designee
         hereby accepts such designation, to have a right to make Advances
         pursuant to Article II of the Credit Agreement. Any delegation by
         Designating Lender to Designee of its rights to make an Advance
         pursuant to such Article II shall be effective at the time of the
         funding of such Advance and not before such time.

                  2. Except as set forth in Section 7 below, the Designating
         Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
         responsibility pursuant to this Designation Agreement with respect to
         (a) any statements, warranties or representations made in or in
         connection with the Credit Agreement or any document related thereto
         (each, a "Loan Document") or the execution, legality, validity,
         enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of any Loan Document
         or any other instrument and document furnished pursuant thereto; and
         (b) the financial condition of the Borrower or Southern or any other
         party or the performance or observance by the Borrower or Southern or
         any other party of any of its obligations under any Loan Document or
         other Material Document to which it is a party or any other instrument
         or document furnished pursuant thereto.

                  3. The Designee (a) confirms that it has received a copy of
         each Loan Document, together with copies of the financial statements
         referred to in Article IV of the Credit Agreement and such other
         documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own
         credit analysis and decision to enter into this Designation Agreement;
         (b) agrees that it will independently and without reliance upon the
         Agent, any Arranger, the Designating Lender or any other Lender and,
         based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at
         the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not
         taking action under any Loan Document; (c) confirms that it is a
         Designated Lender; (d) appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such
         action as Agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and
         discretion under any Loan Document as are delegated to the Agent by the
         terms thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are
         reasonably incidental thereto; and (e) agrees that it will perform in
         accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms
         of any Loan Document are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                  4. The Designee hereby appoints Designating Lender or a
         specified branch or affiliate of Designating Lender as Designee's agent
         and attorney in fact and grants to Designating Lender or a specified
         branch or affiliate of Designating Lender an irrevocable power of
         attorney to receive payments made for the benefit of Designee under the
         Loan Documents, to deliver and receive all communications and notices
         under the Credit Agreement and other Loan Documents and to exercise on
         Designee's behalf all rights to vote and to grant and make approvals,
         waivers, consents and amendments to or under the Credit Agreement or
         other Loan Documents. Designee shall not have any right to approve any
         waiver or amendment of the Credit Agreement, any Note or any other Loan
         Document, or any consent to any departure by the Borrower or Southern
         therefrom, except to the extent that such waiver, amendment or consent
         would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or
         any other amounts payable under any Loan Document or postpone any date
         fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any
         fees or any other amounts payable under any Loan Document. Any document
         executed by such agent on the Designee's behalf in connection with the
         Credit Agreement or other Loan Documents shall be binding on the
         Designee. The Borrower, the Agent and each of the Lenders may rely on
         and are beneficiaries of the preceding provisions.

                  5. Following the execution of this Designation Agreement by
         the Designating Lender and its Designee, it will be delivered to the
         Agent for acceptance and recording by the Agent. The effective date for
         this Designation Agreement (the "Effective Date") shall be the date of
         acceptance hereof by the Agent, unless otherwise specified on the
         signature page of this Designation Agreement.

                  6. Each of the Designating Lender and the Agent hereby (a)
         acknowledges that the Designee is relying on the non-petition
         provisions of Section 8.12 of the Credit Agreement as agreed to by all
         signatories thereto; and (b) reaffirms that it will not institute
         against the Designee or join any other Person in instituting against
         the Designee any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
         liquidation proceedings under any federal or state bankruptcy or
         similar law for one year and one day after the payment in full of the
         latest maturing commercial paper note issued by the Designee.

                  7. The Designating Lender unconditionally agrees to pay or
         reimburse the Designee and save the Designee harmless against all
         liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
         judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or disbursements of any kind or
         nature whatsoever which may be imposed or asserted by any of the
         parties to the Loan Documents against the Designee, in its capacity as
         such, in any way relating to or arising out of this Designation
         Agreement or any Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the
         Designee hereunder or thereunder; provided that the Designating Lender
         shall not be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
         losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses
         or disbursements if the same results from the Designee's gross
         negligence or willful misconduct.

                  8. Upon such acceptance and recording by the Agent, as of the
         Effective Date, the Designee shall be a party to the Credit Agreement
         with a right to make Advances as a Designated Lender pursuant to
         Article II of the Credit Agreement and the rights and obligations of a
         Designated Lender related thereto; provided that the Designee shall not
         be required to make payments with respect to such obligations except to
         the extent of excess cash flow of the Designee which is not otherwise
         required to repay obligations of the Designee Lender which are then due
         and payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Designating Lender or a
         specified branch or affiliate of Designating Lender, as administrative
         agent for the Designee, shall be and remain obligated to the Borrower,
         the Agent and the Lenders for each and every of the obligations of the
         Designee and the Designating Lender with respect to the Credit
         Agreement, including any indemnification obligations under Section 7.05
         of the Credit Agreement and any sums otherwise payable to any Loan
         Party by the Designee.

                  9. This Designation Agreement shall be governed by and
         construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York.

                  10. This Designation Agreement may be executed in any number
         of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
         counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
         original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
         same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
         to this Designation Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be
         effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
         Designation Agreement.

[Date of Initial Borrowing
for relevant Subsequent Project]



Citibank, N.A.
388 Greenwich Street, 20th Floor
New York, New York 10013
     (as Agent for the Lenders)

Subject: Independent Engineer's Report
         Southern Power Company Subsequent Project(s)

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  This letter is furnished pursuant to Section [3.04(a)(iv)(C)]
/ [3.04(b)(v)(C)] / [3.06(d)] of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated
as of April 17, 2003 (the "Credit Agreement") by and among Southern Power
Company (the "Borrower"), Citibank, N.A. (the "Agent"), Citigroup Global Markets
Inc., as Lead Arranger, the Co-Arrangers and the financial institutions named
therein (the "Lenders"). Capitalized terms used in this letter and not otherwise
defined herein shall have the respective meanings specified in the Credit
Agreement.

                  R. W. Beck, Inc. (the "Independent Engineer") has been
retained by the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, as the Independent Engineer and
it has prepared an Independent Engineer's Report dated _______ __, ____ (the
"Report") relating to the [insert name(s) of Subsequent Project(s)](the
"Subsequent Project(s)"), a copy of which is attached as Annex A.

                  The Report was prepared pursuant to the scope of services
under our Professional Services Agreement with the Agent on behalf of the
Lenders and those services were provided in accordance with generally accepted
engineering practices.

                  In connection with the preparation of the Report, personnel of
the Independent Engineer have participated in meetings or telephone discussions
with representatives of the Borrower[, counsel to the Borrower, the Agent, and
counsel to the Agent] in regard to the Subsequent Project(s).

                  Based on our review of the information made available to us by
the Borrower on the Subsequent Project(s) as of the date of the Report, we have
noted, among other things as set forth in the Report, certain observations and
have arrived at certain conclusions regarding the design, technical provisions
of the agreements and other aspects of the Subsequent Project(s) as set forth
below. The Agent and the Lenders are encouraged to read the Report in its
entirety for the purpose of understanding the following observations and
conclusions:

1.   Each of the Subsequent Projects, from a technical and engineering
     perspective, appears to have been, or is expected to be, designed by
     Southern Company Services, Inc. ("SCS") in accordance with prudent industry
     standards and practices for similar plants.

2.   SCS has demonstrated experience in the design, engineering, procurement,
     and construction of power plants similar to each of the Subsequent
     Projects. [An affiliate of Southern Company] has demonstrated experience in
     the operation of power plants similar to each of the Subsequent Projects.

3.   The major components of each of the Subsequent Projects (including, without
     limitation, the turbines, generators, and heat recovery steam generators)
     are identical to the components incorporated in one or more of the Initial
     Projects.

4.   Each of the Subsequent Projects utilizes sound technology and proven
     methods of electric generation in accordance with generally accepted
     industry practice. If operated and maintained consistent with generally
     accepted industry practices, each of the Subsequent Projects should be
     capable of meeting: (1) the heat rate, output, and availabilities assumed
     in its Project Base Case Projections as set forth in Section [ ] of the
     Report; (2) the requirements set forth in each Power Purchase Agreement (if
     any) entered into with respect to such Subsequent Project and referred to
     in Section [ ] of the Report (collectively, the "Relevant Power Purchase
     Agreements"); and (3) the requirements of the major permits and approvals
     required for the construction and operation of each of the Subsequent
     Projects (the "Project Permits").

5.   The performance tests used, or to be used, to determine whether each of
     Substantial Completion and Final Completion with respect to each of the
     Subsequent Projects has been achieved are (a) consistent with the testing
     procedures set forth in, or determined pursuant to, Schedule V of the
     Credit Agreement; (b) similar to performance test programs conducted for
     electric generating plants of the type and size of such Subsequent Project
     with which we are familiar; (c) adequate for demonstrating the capability
     of the Subsequent Project(s) to meet the Guaranteed Heat Rate, Guaranteed
     Output, and the air emissions requirements under the Project Permits, in
     each case, applicable thereto; and (d) consistent with the testing
     procedures set forth in the Relevant Power Purchase Agreements.

6.   The construction schedule applicable to each of the Subsequent Projects, as
     determined pursuant to the major equipment supply contracts and major
     construction contracts, is consistent with (a) the Scheduled Completion
     Date, as set forth in the Project Schedule for that Subsequent Project; and
     (b) the requirements under all Relevant Power Purchase Agreements entered
     into with respect to such Subsequent Project. The performance guarantees
     applicable to each of the Subsequent Projects, as contained in the major
     equipment supply contracts and major construction contracts are consistent
     with (i) the Guaranteed Output and Guaranteed Heat Rate applicable thereto,
     each as set forth in the Project Schedule for that Subsequent Project; and
     (ii) all corresponding performance guarantees in all Relevant Power
     Purchase Agreements entered into with respect to such Subsequent Project.

7.   Upon achievement of Substantial Completion, the [proposed] design of each
     of the Subsequent Projects was, or will be, consistent with the obligations
     relating to performance of such Subsequent Project under the Relevant Power
     Purchase Agreements applicable thereto.

8.   Set out in Sections [ ] and [ ] of the Report is a description of each
     material project contract for the construction (if applicable), operation
     and maintenance of each of the Subsequent Projects, including, without
     limitation, all equipment supply contracts with respect to major components
     and construction contracts (if such Subsequent Project is not a Completed
     Project), interconnection contracts, contracts for the supply and
     transportation of fuel (unless one or more of the Relevant Power Purchase
     Agreements have been entered into with respect to the entire output of such
     Subsequent Project, and the purchaser(s) thereunder are solely responsible
     for fuel supply and transportation), the supply and discharge of water and
     the operation and maintenance of such Subsequent Project, and long term
     service contract(s) with respect to turbines and generators, in each case,
     in existence as of the date hereof (with respect to each of the Subsequent
     Projects, the "Project Contracts"). The term and technical and pricing
     provisions of the Project Contracts with respect to each of the Subsequent
     Projects have been taken into consideration in the preparation of the
     Project Base Case Projections.

9.   Set out in Section [ ] of the Report is a list and brief description of the
     Project Permits. Although all Project Permits have not been obtained to
     date, some of which cannot be obtained until a respective project is ready
     to operate, we are not aware of any technical or engineering circumstances
     that would prevent the issuance of the remaining Project Permits. The
     technical provisions of the Project Permits with respect to each of the
     Subsequent Projects have been taken into consideration in the preparation
     of the Project Base Case Projections.

10.  The Initial Project Budget for each of the Subsequent Projects includes all
     Project Costs anticipated to be incurred up to Final Completion of such
     Subsequent Project (including contingency). The construction cost included
     in the Initial Project Budget has been developed in accordance with
     generally accepted estimating practices and is comparable to the like costs
     of other projects similar in size and technology with which we are
     familiar.

11.  The Project Base Case Projections for each of the Subsequent Projects (a)
     incorporate the forecasted prices for electricity and fuel provided to us
     by the Independent Market Consultant applicable to such Subsequent Project;
     (b) incorporate assumptions regarding heat rates, outputs and
     availabilities that we believe to be achievable; and (c) include the
     assumption (as agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders) that the debt
     referred to in such Project Base Case Projections has a term of 20 years
     and that such debt will bear interest at the rate of 8.25% per annum
     throughout its term.

12.  Environmental site assessments for each of the Subsequent Projects
     performed by [Insert name of environmental consultant that performed
     assessment] were conducted in a manner consistent with industry standards,
     using comparable industry protocols for similar studies with which we are
     familiar. The results of the environmental site assessments with respect to
     each of the Subsequent Projects have been taken into consideration in the
     preparation of the Project Base Case Projections.


                  For purposes of this letter, the Independent Engineer has, at
the request of the Agent, carried out certain limited procedures for the period
commencing ____________ ___, ___ [Insert the date one day after the date of the
Report] and ending on____________ ___, ___ [Insert the date of this
certificate], consisting solely of the making of inquiries of the Borrower as to
whether there has been any material change in the information provided by them,
and upon which the Independent Engineer relied, for purposes of the Report.
These procedures would not be sufficient under generally accepted engineering
practices to enable the Independent Engineer to express an opinion as to the
matters covered by the Report and would not necessarily reveal matters of
significance with respect to the statement in the last sentence of this
paragraph. The Independent Engineer, therefore, expresses no opinion as to the
matters covered by the Report as of any date subsequent to the date of the
Report and makes no representations as to the sufficiency of the foregoing
procedures for the Agent's purposes. Nothing has come to the attention of the
Independent Engineer as a result of the foregoing procedures, however, that
caused the Independent Engineer to believe that, as of the date to which the
procedures were carried out, the opinions of the Independent Engineer set forth
in the Report were not correct.

                  This letter is solely for the information of, and assistance
to, the Agent and the Lenders in conducting and documenting their investigation
of the matters covered by the Report in connection with the Subsequent
Project(s) and is not to be used, circulated, quoted, or otherwise referred to
within or without the lending group for any purpose, nor is it to be referred to
in whole or in part in any other document, except that reference may be made to
it in the above-mentioned Credit Agreement or in any list of closing documents
pertaining to the Subsequent Project(s).

                  The Independent Engineer disclaims any obligation to update
this letter. This letter is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon by any
party other than the Agent and the Lenders.

Very truly yours,

R. W. BECK, INC.

                         [Letterhead of Marsh USA Inc.]


[Date of initial Borrowing
for relevant Subsequent Project]


The Lenders referred to below and
Citibank, N.A. (as Agent for such Lenders)

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We refer to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of April 17, 2003
(as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time
to time, the "Credit Agreement") by and among Southern Power Company (the
"Borrower"), Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as Lead Arranger, the Co-Arrangers
and Lenders party thereto and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (the
"Agent") for the Lenders. Defined terms used in this certificate and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings specified in the
Credit Agreement.

The undersigned, a duly authorized representative of Marsh USA Inc. (the
"Insurance Consultant"), hereby certifies that:

1.       This certificate is delivered pursuant to Section [3.04(a)(iv)(D)] /
         [3.04(b)(v)(D)] / [3.06(d)] of the Credit Agreement.

2.       In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Insurance Consultant has
         been retained to prepare the Independent Insurance Consultant's Report
         dated [________] (the "Report") relating to [insert name(s) of
         Subsequent Project(s)] (each a "Subsequent Project"), a true and
         correct copy of which is attached hereto as Annex A. The Report
         represents the Insurance Consultant's professional opinion as of the
         date thereof and was prepared in accordance with generally accepted
         practices for independent insurance consulting and with the standards
         of care practiced by leading independent insurance consultants in
         performing similar tasks on like projects and financings.

3.       The Insurance Consultant acknowledges that pursuant to the Credit
         Agreement, the Lenders will be providing financing to the Borrower for
         the acquisition, development, construction, operation and/or
         maintenance of each Subsequent Project.

4.       After due inquiry, we hereby confirm that since the date of the Report,
         no event or circumstance has occurred which:

         (a)      makes, as of the date hereof, any material information or
                  material statement contained in the Report, read as a whole,
                  untrue or incorrect; or

         (b)      should be reflected in the Report in order to make the
                  statements and information contained therein, read as a whole
                  and in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
                  not misleading; or

         (c)      results, as of the date hereof, in the Report, read as a
                  whole, omitting to state any material matter relevant to the
                  insurance program for, or insurable events, losses or
                  casualties relating to, the Subsequent Projects.

5.   We have reviewed the insurance program put in place by the Borrower to
     insure the Subsequent Projects and conclude that (a) the insurance
     coverages (including, without limitation, the types and amounts of
     insurances, the risks insured against, and the limits, deductibles,
     exclusions and excesses applicable to such insurances) are consistent with
     the customs and practices of the utility power industry in the United
     States, and (b) such insurance program is maintained with insurance
     companies and underwriters which are customarily used by the utility power
     industry in the United States to insure against the relevant risks, and the
     use of all such insurance companies and underwriters in accordance with
     such insurance program is appropriate (taking into account all applicable
     coverages under the relevant policies).

6.   This certificate is solely for the information of, and assistance to,
     Citibank, N.A. as Agent and the Lenders from time to time under the Credit
     Agreement, and is not to be otherwise used, circulated, quoted or referred
     to within any document, unless specifically consented to in writing by the
     Insurance Consultant.

[Date of initial Borrowing
for relevant Subsequent Project]


The Lenders referred to below and
Citibank, N.A. (as Agent for such Lenders)


Ladies and Gentlemen:

We refer to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of April 17, 2003
(as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time
to time, the "Credit Agreement") by and among Southern Power Company (the
"Borrower"), Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as Lead Arranger, the Co-Arrangers
and Lenders party thereto and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (the
"Agent") for the Lenders. Defined terms used in this certificate and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings specified in the
Credit Agreement.

The undersigned, a duly authorized representative of PA Consulting, Inc. (the
"Independent Market Consultant"), hereby certifies that:

1.       This certificate is delivered pursuant to section [3.04(a)(iv)(E)] /
         [3.04(b)(v)(E)] / [3.06(d)] of the Credit Agreement.

2.       In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Independent Market
         Consultant has been retained to prepare the Independent Market
         Consultant's Report dated [________] (the "Report") relating to [insert
         name(s) of Subsequent Project(s)] (each a "Subsequent Project"), a true
         and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Report
         represents the Independent Market Consultant's professional opinion as
         of the date thereof and was prepared in accordance with generally
         accepted practices for independent market consulting and with the
         standards of care practiced by leading independent market consultants
         in performing similar tasks on like projects and financings.

3.       The Independent Market Consultant acknowledges that pursuant to the
         Credit Agreement, the Lenders will be providing financing to the
         Borrower for the acquisition, development, construction, operation
         and/or maintenance of each Subsequent Project.

4.       After due inquiry, we hereby confirm that since the date of the Report,
         no event or circumstance has occurred which:

         (a)      makes, as of the date hereof, any material information or
                  material statement contained in the Report, read as a whole,
                  untrue or incorrect; or

         (b)      should be reflected in the Report in order to make the
                  statements and information contained therein, read as a whole
                  and in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
                  not misleading; or

         (c)      results, as of the date hereof, in the Report, read as a
                  whole, omitting to state any material matter relevant to each
                  electric power market relevant to the Subsequent Projects.

5.       If the Power Purchase Agreement entered into with respect to such
         Subsequent Project is an EMC Contract, the projections for the
         incremental requirement needs of the applicable EMC Counterparty are
         reasonable.

                  This certificate is solely for the information of, and
assistance to, Citibank, N.A. as Agent and the Lenders from time to time under
the Credit Agreement, and is not to be otherwise used, circulated, quoted or
referred to within any document, unless specifically consented to in writing by
the Independent Market Consultant.

                               ____________, 200_


Citibank, N.A., as Agent for
the Lenders under, and as defined in,
the Credit Agreement referred to below


Ladies and Gentlemen:

         The Southern Company ("Southern") hereby refers to that certain Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2003 (the "Credit
Agreement"), among Southern Power Company (the "Borrower"), the Initial Lenders
named therein, Citibank, N.A., as Agent, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as Lead
Arranger, and the Co-Arrangers. Except as otherwise defined in this letter
agreement (the "Agreement"), capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall
have the respective meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement. Southern
owns all of the outstanding stock of the Borrower and acknowledges that it will
benefit from the Credit Agreement.

         Southern, therefore, hereby agrees as follows:

                  (a) if (1) the [name of development authority] (including its
successors and permitted assigns, the "Development Authority") shall: (i) apply
for or consent to the appointment of, or the taking of possession by, a
receiver, custodian, trustee or liquidator of itself or of all or substantially
all of its property; (ii) make a general assignment for the benefit of its
creditors; (iii) commence a voluntary case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (as
now or hereafter in effect) or any similar law of any applicable jurisdiction;
(iv) file a petition seeking to take advantage of any other law relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, winding-up, or composition or
readjustment of debts; or (v) fail to controvert in a timely and appropriate
manner, or acquiesce in writing to, any petition filed against it in an
involuntary case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any similar law of any
applicable jurisdiction; or (2) a proceeding or case shall be commenced, without
the application or consent of the Development Authority, in any court of
competent jurisdiction, seeking (A) its liquidation, reorganization, dissolution
or winding-up, or the composition or readjustment of its debts; (B) the
appointment of a trustee, receiver, custodian, liquidator or the like of the
Development Authority or of all or substantially all of its assets; or (C)
similar relief in respect of the Development Authority under any law relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, winding-up, or composition or adjustment
of debts, and such proceeding or case shall continue unstayed and in effect for
a period of ninety (90) or more days (each a "Bankruptcy Event");

                  (b) if, as a result of such Bankruptcy Event, the Borrower's
leasehold interest with the Development Authority in respect of the [name of
leased project], or any of the Borrower's rights, powers and remedies under or
in connection with the lease of the [name of leased project] with the
Development Authority, or any documents related thereto, is materially and
adversely affected; and

                  (c) if revenues of the Borrower (after payment of (i) all
operating expenses; and (ii) all Recourse Debt of the Borrower (other than the
Project Debt relating to the [name of leased project]) then due and payable, and
accrued interest thereon) are insufficient to repay any or all of the principal
amount of the Project Debt outstanding with respect to the [name of leased
project], and accrued interest thereon, in each case, as and when due;

then, Southern shall (A) on the Final Maturity Date (or, if required to be
prepaid prior to the Final Maturity Date pursuant to the Credit Agreement, on
such earlier date), pay to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders and on
behalf of the Borrower, such amount as may be required to pay in full the
outstanding principal of all Advances then outstanding with respect to the [name
of leased project] and all accrued and unpaid interest related thereto; (B) pay
all interest due and payable, from time to time, on the outstanding Advances
made with respect to the [name of leased project]; and (C) upon the maturity
thereof, pay to the holders of all Commercial Paper then outstanding with
respect to the [name of leased project] and for which there are one or more CP
Commitment Reservations then outstanding (or a trustee on behalf of such
holders), for the account of the Borrower, such amount as may be required to pay
in full the outstanding principal of all such Commercial Paper and all accrued
and unpaid interest related thereto.

         This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Southern and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Southern enforceable
against Southern in accordance with its terms, subject to laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.

         This Agreement is intended to be solely for the benefit of the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders and is not intended to and shall not confer
any rights or benefits on any other party.


                        Very truly yours,

                         DEFERRED COMPENSATION AGREEMENT

         THIS DEFERRED COMPENSATION AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made and entered
into by and between ALABAMA POWER COMPANY (the "Company") and WILLIAM BRUCE
HUTCHINS, III ("Employee").

                               W I T N E S S E T H

         WHEREAS, Employee has been employed by the Company for approximately
thirty-seven (37) years;

         WHEREAS, Employee is a highly compensated employee of the Company and
is a member of its management;

         WHEREAS, the Company wishes to retain Employee as Chief Financial
Officer of the Company through April 1, 2004;

         WHEREAS, the parties desire to delineate their respective rights,
duties, and obligations attendant to the termination of employment of the
Employee, and desire to reach an accord and satisfaction of all then existing
claims arising from Employee's employment and his termination of employment,
with appropriate releases; and

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to compensate Employee for service he has
provided or will provide for the Company;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and the agreements of
the parties set forth in this Agreement, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby covenant and agree as
follows:

         1. Events Rendering Employee Eligible for Deferred Compensation.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Employee shall become eligible to
receive Deferred Compensation (as defined in Paragraph 3) if one of the events
listed in Paragraph 1(a), (b), (c) or (d) below ("Eligibility Events") occurs.

         (a) The Employee remains in Active Service (as defined below) with the
Company as Chief Financial Officer through April 1, 2004, and either the Company
obtains from the Employee an effective Release in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 1 (the effectiveness of such Release being no earlier than the date
Employee's employment is terminated (the "Termination Date")) or the Employee
dies while in Active Service after April 1, 2004;

         (b) The Employee dies prior to April 1, 2004, while in Active Service
with the Company as Chief Financial Officer;

         (c) The Employee becomes Disabled (as defined below) prior to April 1,
2004, while in Active Service with the Company as Chief Financial Officer, and
the Company obtains from the Employee an effective Release in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit 1 (the effectiveness of such Release being no earlier than the
Employee's Termination Date); or

         (d) A Southern Change in Control or Subsidiary Change in Control
affecting Employee as defined in The Southern Company Change in Control Benefit
Plan Determination Policy ("Change in Control") occurs while Employee is in
Active Service and the Company obtains from the Employee an effective Release in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (the effectiveness of such Release being
no earlier than the Employee's Termination Date).

         For purposes of this Paragraph: "Active Service" includes any period
during which the Employee is on the active payroll of the Company, including any
period of sick leave, vacation, absences under the Family and Medical Leave Act,
short-term disability leave or approved but unpaid leave that is unrelated to
Cause (as defined in Paragraph 4). The term "Disabled" shall have the same
meaning as the term is used in The Southern Company Long Term Disability Plan
(or any successor arrangement or plan) (the "Company LTD Plan"), and Employee is
determined to be disabled under the terms of said plan. The Employee represents
that he currently maintains coverage under the Company LTD Plan and hereby
agrees to continue to maintain coverage under the Company LTD Plan through April
1, 2004. The application period for long-term disability benefits under the
Company LTD Plan shall be treated as a period of sick leave.

         2. Complete Consideration. Employee covenants and agrees that the
consideration set forth in Paragraph 3 shall be in full satisfaction of all sums
owed to Employee, if any, by the Company upon the occurrence of an Eligibility
Event, and shall constitute good and complete consideration for meeting the
requirements of the applicable Eligibility Event and for the Release attached
hereto as Exhibit 1, those non-disclosure and non-interference obligations under
Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 hereof and all other obligations and covenants of
Employee contained herein, including, but not limited to, Paragraph 6. Employee
agrees that this Agreement provides him certain benefits to which he would not
otherwise be entitled.

         3. Deferred Compensation Payment to Employee.

         (a) Except as provided below, following the occurrence of one of the
Eligibility Events set forth in Paragraph 1 hereto, the Company shall pay to the
Employee deferred compensation according to one of the following subparagraphs
("Deferred Compensation").

         (i)      Following the occurrence of an Eligibility Event set forth in
                  Paragraph 1(a), (b) or (c) hereto, the Company shall pay to
                  Employee (or his spouse or estate as described below) Deferred
                  Compensation equal to 2.6 times Employee's base salary as of
                  the day immediately preceding his Termination Date. The
                  Deferred Compensation described in the preceding sentence
                  shall be paid to Employee (or his spouse or estate as
                  described below) in five equal, annual installments which
                  shall be calculated based on an effective interest rate of
                  7.5% per annum (0.6045% per month) and commence on the first
                  day of the first month following the occurrence of an
                  Eligibility Event under Paragraph 1(a), (b) or (c).

         (ii)     Following the occurrence of the Eligibility Event set forth in
                  Paragraph 1(d) hereto, the Company shall pay to Employee (or
                  his spouse or estate as described below) a lump sum amount
                  equal to 2.6 times Employee's base salary as of the day
                  immediately preceding his Termination Date, as soon as
                  practicable following the occurrence of such Eligibility
                  Event. The lump sum payment described in the preceding
                  sentence shall be reduced in such an amount and to such extent
                  that no amount of the payment, plus all other "parachute
                  payments" under Internal Revenue Code ("Code") Section 280G,
                  would constitute an "excess parachute payment" under Code
                  Section 280G, but only to the extent that if the payment under
                  this Paragraph 3(a)(ii) were increased by one additional
                  dollar ($1.00), a portion of the payment under this Paragraph
                  3(a)(ii) would be an "excess parachute payment" under Code
                  Section 280G. The payment under this Paragraph 3(a)(ii) and
                  any other determination relating to the applicability of Code
                  Section 280G (and the rules and regulations thereunder) to the
                  payment contemplated by Paragraph 3(a)(ii) of this Agreement
                  shall be made by the tax department of the independent public
                  accounting firm then responsible for preparing the Company's
                  consolidated federal income tax return, and such determination
                  shall be binding upon the Employee and the Company.

         (iii)    Notwithstanding subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above, in the event
                  the Eligibility Event set forth in Paragraph 1(d) occurs
                  together with any of the other Eligibility Events set forth in
                  Paragraph 1, Employee shall receive Deferred Compensation in
                  accordance with subparagraph (ii) above.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount of Deferred Compensation
payable under this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of benefits, if any,
payable to Employee under any career transition, severance or separation plan or
program sponsored by the Company.

         (b) In the event of a Change in Control which occurs after an
Eligibility Event set forth in Paragraph 1(a), (b) or (c) hereto, any unpaid
Deferred Compensation under this Paragraph 3 shall be paid in a lump sum as soon
as practicable after the occurrence of such Change in Control. The lump sum
shall be equal to the present value of any unpaid amount based on an effective
interest rate of 7.5% per annum (0.6045% per month).

         (c) In the event the Eligibility Event described in Paragraph 1(b)
occurs or the Employee dies after or in conjunction with an Eligibility Event
described in Paragraph 1(a), (c) or (d), but before receiving payment of
Deferred Compensation described in this Paragraph 3, such unpaid Deferred
Compensation shall be paid to Employee's spouse, if living, or if not, to the
Employee's estate.

         (d) In accordance with Paragraph 21, Employee shall be responsible for
all payroll taxes, including, without limitation, local, state and federal
income taxes and his share of FICA taxes owed on the Deferred Compensation, and
Company shall make appropriate withholding of these amounts.

         (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Employee engages in
Misconduct, as defined below, before or after Employee's Eligibility Event but
prior to receiving the Deferred Compensation described in this Paragraph 3,
Company may not pay the Deferred Compensation to Employee under this Paragraph
3, and Company shall have no further obligations with respect to any amounts
under this Agreement. For purposes of this Paragraph 3(e), "Misconduct" shall
mean (i) the final conviction of any felony, or (ii) the carrying out of any
activity or the making of any public statement which materially diminishes or
materially and untruthfully brings Southern into contempt, ridicule or
materially and reasonably shocks or offends the community in which the Southern
affiliate is located.

         4. Termination with Cause. In the event of Employee's termination of
employment for Cause at any time, the Employee shall forfeit the entire benefit
provided in Paragraph 3 and the Company shall have no further obligations with
respect to any amount under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term
"Cause" shall mean gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of
the duties and services required in the course of employment by the Company; the
final conviction of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; the
carrying out of any activity or the making of any statement which would
prejudice the good name and standing of any of the Southern Entities or would
bring any of the Southern Entities into contempt, ridicule or would reasonably
shock or offend any community in which any of the Southern Entities is located;
a material breach of the fiduciary obligations owed by an officer and an
employee to any of the Southern Entities; or the Employee's unsatisfactory
performance of the duties and services required by his or her employment.

         5. Publicity; No Disparaging Statement. Except as otherwise provided in
Paragraph 14 hereof, Employee and the Company covenant and agree that they shall
not engage in any communications which shall disparage one another or interfere
with their existing or prospective business relationships.

         6. No Employment. Employee agrees that he shall not seek re-employment
as an employee, leased employee or independent contractor with the Company or
the Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, for
purposes of this Paragraph 6, "Southern Company System"), for a period of
twenty-four (24) months following the execution of the Release attached hereto
as Exhibit 1. The Company or any member of the Southern Company System shall not
rehire the Employee as an employee, leased employee or independent contractor
for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the Employee's execution of
the Release attached hereto as Exhibit 1, unless an exceptional business reason
exists for rehiring the Employee and a committee, comprised of (i) an officer
from the business unit seeking to rehire the Employee and (ii) the Southern
Company Senior Vice President, Human Resources, approves of such rehiring.

         7. Business Protection Provision Definitions.

                  not being generally known to, and not being readily
                  ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain
                  economic value from its disclosure or use; and (B) is the
                  subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances
                  to maintain its secrecy. The Employee agrees that trade
                  secrets include non-public information related to the rate
                  making process of the Southern Entities and any other
                  information which is defined as a "trade secret" under
                  applicable law.

         (vi)     "Work Product" shall mean all tangible work product, property,
                  data, documentation, "know-how," concepts or plans,
                  inventions, improvements, techniques and processes relating to
                  the Southern Entities that were conceived, discovered,
                  created, written, revised or developed by Employee during the
                  term of his employment with the Company.

         8. Nondisclosure: Ownership of Proprietary Property.

         (a) In recognition of the need of the Company to protect its legitimate
business interests, Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, Employee hereby
covenants and agrees that Employee shall regard and treat Trade Secrets and all
Confidential Information as strictly confidential and wholly-owned by the
Company and shall not, for any reason, in any fashion, either directly or
indirectly, use, sell, lend, lease, distribute, license, give, transfer, assign,
show, disclose, disseminate, reproduce, copy, misappropriate or otherwise
communicate any such item or information to any third party or Entity for any
purpose other than in accordance with this Agreement or as required by
applicable law: (i) with regard to each item constituting a Trade Secret, at all
times such information remains a "trade secret" under applicable law, and (ii)
with regard to any Confidential Information, for a period ending three (3) years
following the Termination Date (hereafter the "Restricted Period").

         (b) Employee shall exercise best efforts to ensure the continued
confidentiality of all Trade Secrets and Confidential Information, and he shall
immediately notify the Company of any unauthorized disclosure or use of any
Trade Secrets or Confidential Information of which Employee becomes aware.
Employee shall assist the Company, to the extent necessary, in the protection of
or procurement of any intellectual property protection or other rights in any of
the Trade Secrets or Confidential Information.

         (c) All Work Product shall be owned exclusively by the Company. To the
greatest extent possible, any Work Product shall be deemed to be "work made for
hire" (as defined in the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.A. ss. 101 et seq., as
amended), and Employee hereby unconditionally and irrevocably transfers and
assigns to the Company all right, title and interest Employee currently has or
may have by operation of law or otherwise in or to any Work Product, including,
without limitation, all patents, copyrights, trademarks (and the goodwill
associated therewith), trade secrets, service marks (and the goodwill associated
therewith) and other intellectual property rights. Employee agrees to execute
and deliver to the Company any transfers, assignments, documents or other
instruments which the Company may deem necessary or appropriate, from time to
time, to protect the rights granted herein or to vest complete title and
ownership of any and all Work Product, and all associated intellectual property
and other rights therein, exclusively in the Company.

         (d) Employee represents and agrees that he will keep all terms and
provisions of this Agreement completely confidential, except for possible
disclosures to his legal advisors or to the extent required by law, and Employee
further agrees that he will not disclose the terms, provisions or information
contained in or concerning this Agreement to anyone, including, but not limited
to, any past, present, or prospective employee or applicant for employment with
the Company. Employee agrees that he may only disclose to future, potential
employers of Employee that he participates in a Deferred Compensation Agreement
with the Company which imposes certain restrictions on him.


         9. Non-Interference With Employees.

         Employee covenants and agrees that during the Restricted Period he will
not, either directly or indirectly, alone or in conjunction with any other
person or Entity: (A) actively recruit, solicit, attempt to solicit, or induce
any person who, during such Restricted Period, or within one year prior to the
Termination Date, was an exempt employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or was an officer of any of the other Southern Entities to leave
or cease such employment for any reason whatsoever; or (B) hire or engage the
services of any such person described in Paragraph 9(A) in any business
substantially similar or competitive with that in which the Southern Entities
were engaged during his employment.

         10. Non-Interference With Customers.

         (a) Employee acknowledges that in the course of employment, he has
learned about Company's business, services, materials, programs and products and
the manner in which they are developed, marketed, serviced and provided.
Employee knows and acknowledges that the Company has invested considerable time
and money in developing its programs, agreements, offices, representatives,
services, products and marketing techniques and that they are unique and
original. Employee further acknowledges that the Company must keep secret all
pertinent information divulged to Employee and Company's business concepts,
ideas, programs, plans and processes, so as not to aid Company's competitors.
Accordingly, Company is entitled to the protection described in Paragraph 10(b),
which Employee agrees is reasonable.

         (b) Employee covenants and agrees that for a period ending two (2)
years following the Termination Date, he will not, on his own behalf or on
behalf of any person or Entity, solicit, direct, appropriate, call upon, or
initiate communication or contact with any person or Entity or any
representative of any person or Entity, with whom Employee had contact during
his employment, with a view toward the sale or the providing of any product,
equipment or service sold or provided or under development by Company during the
period of two (2) years immediately preceding the date of Employee's
termination. The restrictions set forth in this section shall apply only to
persons or Entities with whom Employee had actual contact during the two (2)
years prior to termination of employment with a view toward the sale or
providing of any product, equipment or service sold or provided or under
development by Company.

         11. Non-Interference With Business.

         (a) Employee and Company expressly covenant and agree that the scope,
territorial, time and other restrictions contained in this entire Agreement
constitute the most reasonable and equitable restrictions possible to protect
the business interest of the Company given: (i) the business of the Company;
(ii) the competitive nature of the Company's industry; and (iii) that Employee's
skills are such that he could easily find alternative, commensurate employment
or consulting work in his field which would not violate any of the provisions of
this Agreement. The Employee further acknowledges that the payment described in
Paragraph 3 is also in consideration of his covenants and agreements contained
in Paragraphs 7 through 11 hereof.

         (b) Employee covenants and agrees to not obtain or work in a
Competitive Position within the Territory for a period of two (2) years from the
Termination Date.

         12. Return of Materials. Upon the Employee's termination, or at any
point after that time upon the specific request of the Company, Employee shall
return to the Company all written or descriptive materials of any kind belonging
or relating to the Company or its affiliates, including, without limitation, any
originals, copies and abstracts containing any Work Product, intellectual
property, Confidential Information and Trade Secrets in Employee's possession or
control.

         13. Cooperation. The parties agree that as a result of Employee's
duties and activities during his employment, Employee's reasonable availability
may be necessary for the Company to meaningfully respond to or address actual or
threatened litigation, or government inquiries or investigations, or required
filings with state, federal or foreign agencies (hereinafter "Company Matters").
Upon request of the Company, and at any point following termination of
employment, Employee will make himself available to the Company for reasonable
periods consistent with his future employment, if any, by other Entities and
will cooperate with its agents and attorneys as reasonably required by such
Company Matters. The Company will reimburse Employee for any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses associated with providing such cooperation.

         14. Confidentiality and Legal Process. Employee represents and agrees
that he will keep the terms, amount and fact of this Agreement confidential and
that he will not hereafter disclose any information concerning this Agreement to
anyone other than his personal agents, including, but not limited to, any past,
present, or prospective employee or applicant for employment with Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement is intended to prohibit
Employee from performing any duty or obligation that shall arise as a matter of
law. Specifically, Employee shall continue to be under a duty to truthfully
respond to any legal and valid subpoena or other legal process. This Agreement
is not intended in any way to proscribe Employee's right and ability to provide
information to any federal, state or local government in the lawful exercise of
such governments' governmental functions.

         15. Successors And Assigns; Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of Employee and his heirs, administrators,
representatives, executors, successors and assigns, and shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Company and its officers, directors, employees,
agents, shareholders, parent corporation and affiliates, and their respective
predecessors, successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators and each
of them, and to their heirs, administrators, representatives, executors,
successors and assigns. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of the State of Alabama, United States of America
(without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws).

         16. Complete Agreement. This Agreement shall constitute the full and
complete Agreement between the parties concerning its subject matter and fully
supersedes any and all other prior agreements or understandings, in whatever
form, between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, including, but
not limited to, that certain letter from Mr. Charles McCrary on behalf of
Alabama Power Company dated August 22, 2002 and any other discussions,
agreements, letters, memorandums or understandings concerning payments to be
made by the Company in order to induce Employee to remain Chief Financial
Officer of the Company or in connection with Employee's termination of
employment. This Agreement shall not be modified or amended except by a written
instrument signed by both Employee and an authorized representative of the
Company.

         17. Severability. The unenforceability or invalidity of any particular
provision of this Agreement shall not affect its other provisions, and to the
extent necessary to give such other provisions effect, they shall be deemed
severable. The judicial body interpreting this Agreement shall be authorized and
instructed to rewrite any of the sections which are enforceable as written in
such a fashion so that they may be enforced to the greatest extent legally
possible. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, the covenants and
agreements contained in Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, shall be construed as
covenants and agreements independent of each other or any other contract between
the parties hereto and that the existence of any claim or cause of action by
Employee against Company, whether predicated upon this Agreement or any other
contract, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Company of said
covenants and agreements.

         18. Waiver Of Breach; Specific Performance. The waiver of a breach of
any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of
any other breach. Each of the parties to this Agreement will be entitled to
enforce its or his rights under this Agreement, specifically, to recover damages
by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all
other rights existing in its or his favor. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of
the provisions of this Agreement and that any party may in its or his sole
discretion apply to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for
specific performance or injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent any
violations of the provisions of this Agreement.

         19. Unsecured General Creditor. The Company shall neither reserve nor
specifically set aside funds for the payment of its obligations under this
Agreement, and such obligations shall be paid solely from the general assets of
the Company. Notwithstanding that Employee may be entitled to receive the value
of his benefit under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the assets from
which such amount may be paid shall at all times be subject to the claims of the
Company's creditors.

         20. No Effect On Other Arrangements. It is expressly understood and
agreed that the payment made in accordance with this Agreement is in addition to
any other benefits or compensation to which Employee may be entitled or for
which he may be eligible, whether funded or unfunded, by reason of his
employment with the Company.

         21. Tax Withholding. There shall be deducted from the payment under
this Agreement the amount of any tax required by any governmental authority to
be withheld and paid over by the Company to such governmental authority for the
account of Employee.

         22. Compensation. Any compensation paid on behalf of Employee under
this Agreement shall not be considered "compensation," as the term is defined in
The Southern Company Employee Savings Plan, The Southern Company Employee Stock
Ownership Plan, The Southern Company Performance Sharing Plan or The Southern
Company Pension Plan. The payment under this Agreement shall not be considered
wages, salaries or compensation under any other employee benefit plan.

         23. No Guarantee of Employment. No provision of this Agreement shall be
construed to affect in any manner the existing rights of the Company to suspend,
terminate, alter, modify, whether or not for cause, the employment relationship
of Employee and the Company.

         24. Interpretation. The judicial body interpreting this Agreement shall
not more strictly construe the terms of this Agreement against one party, it
being agreed that both parties and/or their attorneys or agents have negotiated
and participated in the preparation hereof.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement,
this 11th day of April, 2003.
