                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
                  SECOND QUARTER 1998 vs. SECOND QUARTER 1997

                     YEAR-TO-DATE 1998 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 1997

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

     SOUTHERN's  consolidated net income for the second quarter and year-to-date
1998 was $271  million  ($0.39 per share) and $512  million  ($0.74 per  share),
respectively, compared to $215 million ($0.31 per share) and $402 million ($0.59
per  share)  for the  corresponding  periods  of 1997.  Earnings  for the second
quarter and year-to-date  1998 improved due to strong  performance from both the
traditional and non-traditional businesses.

     SOUTHERN's traditional core business is primarily represented by its five
domestic electric utility operating companies, which provide electric service in
four Southeastern states. Another significant portion of SOUTHERN's business is
its non-traditional business primarily represented by Southern Energy, which
owns and manages international and domestic businesses for SOUTHERN. Businesses
acquired by Southern Energy have been included in the consolidated statements of
income since the date of acquisition. Certain changes in operating revenues and
expenses from the prior period result from such acquisitions. Significant income
statement items appropriate for discussion include the following:

     Operating revenues. Operating revenues for the traditional core business
for the second quarter and year-to-date 1998 increased $412 million or 20.4% and
$459 million or 11.7%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of
1997. Traditional core business revenues increased for the second quarter and
year-to-date 1998 primarily due to increases in energy sales of 16.2% and 10.4%,
respectively. Sales of energy to residential, commercial and industrial
customers rose by 32.5%, 13.8% and 6.3%, respectively, for the quarter and
19.9%, 8.3% and 4.8%, respectively, year-to-date due to hotter temperatures
during these periods when compared to the milder-than-normal temperatures
recorded in the corresponding periods in 1997. Retail revenues,

excluding fuel and any demand-side program revenues which generally do not
affect income, increased $266 million for the second quarter and $303 million
for year-to-date 1998. Operating revenues for non-traditional business were down
by $216 million or 30.9% for the quarter and $334 million or 24.3% year-to-date
when compared to the same periods in 1997 due primarily to a change to the
equity method of reporting for Southern Energy's energy marketing activities.
Prior to January 1998, these activities were accounted for on a consolidated
basis. (See Note (D) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements"
herein.)

     Fuel expense. The increases for the second quarter and year-to-date
resulted from increased generation required to meet the higher demand for
energy.

     Purchased power expense. For the second quarter and year-to-date 1998,
purchased power expenses for the traditional core business rose by $63.4 million
or 157.1% and $104.9 million or 145.2%, respectively. These expenses increased
mainly due to the increased sale of energy to the different classes of retail
customers. For non-traditional business, purchased power expenses dropped $244
million or 55.0% for the quarter and $435 million or 50.1% year-to-date when
compared to the same periods in 1997. The primary reason for this decline is the
change in reporting for Southern Energy's energy marketing activities, as
mentioned above.

     Other operation expense. For the traditional business, these expenses were
up $42.7 million or 11.9% for the quarter and $65.1 million or 9.5% year-to-date
1998 when compared to the same periods in 1997. The reasons for the increases
include the additional costs incurred for a new customer service system,
modifications of certain information systems for year 2000 compliance and
property damage and other reserves. For the non-traditional business, these
expenses were up $32.3 million or 32.3% for the quarter and $46.2 million or
23.6% year-to-date when compared to the corresponding periods in 1997 due
primarily to additional costs related to continued growth in this business.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization
expense of the traditional core business for the quarter and year-to-date,
increased compared to the corresponding periods in 1997. These increases are
attributed primarily to additions to utility plant and to additional
depreciation charges of $127.1 million for the quarter and $139.3 million
year-to-date, pursuant to GEORGIA's retail accounting order as discussed in Note
(L) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein.

     Amortization of deferred Plant Vogtle costs. These costs decreased for the
quarter and year-to-date due to the completion in September 1997 of the
amortization of levelized buybacks and Plant Vogtle Unit 1 cost deferrals under
the 1987 Georgia PSC order. See Note (M) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements", herein for further details.

     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. The increases in this
item for the quarter and year-to-date 1998 are primarily attributed to BEWAG.
Southern Energy acquired a 26% interest in this Berlin, Germany, integrated
utility in September 1997.

     Interest income. The second quarter and year-to-date increases in interest
income were primarily in the traditional business. These increases are
attributed to the settlement between SOUTHERN and the IRS relating to tax issues
for the years 1984 through 1987. For additional information, see Note (H) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein.

     Other, net. The second quarter and year-to-date 1998 decreases from the
same periods in 1997 were primarily due to donations and contributions during
the second quarter of 1998, and the recognition during the first quarter of 1997
of gains related to the sale of assets and construction activities.

     Income taxes applicable to other income. The increases for the quarter and
year-to-date are primarily due to the taxes associated with additional interest
income, as mentioned above.

     Amortization of debt discount, premium, and expense, net. Second quarter
and year-to-date 1998 increases primarily result from ALABAMA's accelerated
amortization of premiums incurred in connection with the refinancing of
high-cost debt, in the amount of $25.0 million, as allowed by the Alabama PSC.
See Note (J) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for
further details.

     Other interest charges, net. These charges increased for the quarter and
year-to-date due primarily to the recognition of interest related to tax issues
and certain interest charges related to a nuclear decommissioning trust.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment, with non-traditional business becoming more significant. For
information relating to non-traditional business activities, see Item 1 -
BUSINESS - "Non-Traditional Business" in the Form 10-K.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     SOUTHERN has assessed and developed a detailed strategy to prevent or at
least minimize problems related to the year 2000 issue. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     In May 1998, SOUTHERN through its subsidiary Southern Energy announced that
it had agreed to purchase electric generating assets in New England from
subsidiaries of Commonwealth Energy System and Eastern Utilities Associates for
$537 million. Southern Energy will own and operate the plants which have a
combined generating capacity of 1,260 megawatts, while Southern Company Energy
Marketing, which markets electricity and natural gas nationwide, will sell the
output to the divesting utilities and in the open market.

     In June 1998, SOUTHERN, through its subsidiary Southern Energy, sold an
additional 26% interest in SWEB Holdings Limited, the holding company for SWEB,
to PP&L Resources for $170 million.

     In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued a new Statement of Position (SOP), Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The SOP, which must be adopted
by 1999, requires capitalization of certain costs of internal-use software.
Adoption of the SOP is not expected to have a material impact on the financial
statements.

     In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. This statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. While SOUTHERN has not
yet quantified the impact of adopting this statement on its financial
statements, it could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive
income.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H), (J) through
(O) and (Q) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for
discussion of various contingencies and other matters which may affect future
earnings potential. Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal
Proceedings" herein.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first six months of
1998 included $958 million used for gross property additions to utility plant;
$200 million used for Southern Energy acquisitions; and $187 million received
from property sales. The funds for these additions, acquisitions and other
capital requirements were from operations and sales of securities. See
SOUTHERN's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first six months of 1998, retirements of the operating companies'
first mortgage bonds and preferred stock totaled $503 million and $41 million,
respectively. A subsidiary of GULF formed a statutory business trust which sold,
during the first six months of 1998, $45 million of trust preferred securities.
In June 1998, a subsidiary of SOUTHERN formed a statutory business trust which
sold $200 million of trust originated preferred securities. See Note (I) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further details. Also
during the first six months of 1998, ALABAMA issued $200 million of 7% senior
notes due December 31, 2047, and $190 million of 7% senior notes due March 31,
2048; GEORGIA issued $145 million of 6 7/8% senior notes due December 31, 2047;
GULF issued $50 million of 6.70% senior notes due June 30, 2038; MISSISSIPPI
issued $55 million of 6.75% senior notes due June 30, 2038 and $35 million of
6.05% senior notes due May 1, 2003; and SAVANNAH issued $30 million of 6 5/8%
senior notes due March 17, 2015.

     During the first six months of 1998, SOUTHERN raised $112 million from the
issuance of new common stock under SOUTHERN's various stock plans. The market
price of SOUTHERN's common stock at June 30, 1998 was $27.6875 per share and the
book value was $14.05 per share, representing a market-to-book ratio of 197%,
compared to $25.875, $13.91 and 186%, respectively, at the end of 1997. The
dividend for the second quarter of 1998 was $0.335 per share.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of SOUTHERN
under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and
"Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern
electric system's capital requirements for its construction program,
environmental compliance efforts, sinking fund requirements and maturing debt.
Approximately $567 million will be required by June 30, 1999, for present
sinking fund requirements, redemption of preferred stock and redemptions and
maturities of long-term debt. Also, the operating companies plan to continue, to
the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock
and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 1998, as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
June 30, 1998, approximately $687 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $4.8 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks (including
$1,267 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made only to
fund purchase obligations of the operating companies relating to variable rate
pollution control bonds). At June 30, 1998, the system companies had outstanding
approximately $745 million of short-term notes payable and $1,094 million of
commercial paper. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

     See Note (D) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for discussion of financial derivative contracts entered into by SOUTHERN.

     Revenues. The increase in revenues for the second quarter and year-to-date
1998 was primarily due to increases in territorial energy sales and
non-territorial wholesale energy sales. Territorial revenues increased $142.0
million and $150.6 million, respectively, for the current quarter and
year-to-date 1998, when compared to the same periods in 1997. The increase in
territorial revenue is attributed to increased retail sales of 17.9% and 11.2%
for the second quarter and year-to-date, respectively, as a result of extremely
hot weather in the second quarter of 1998 as compared to the very mild weather
for same periods in 1997. Also, a strong economy in the company's service
territory contributed to the increase in revenue. Retail revenues, excluding
those revenues which represent the recovery of fuel expense and certain other
expenses and do not affect income, increased $82.0 million and $92.8 million,
for the current quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Non-territorial
wholesale revenues increased $7.4 million and $13.1 million for the second
quarter and year-to-date, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 1997.
The higher non-territorial wholesale energy sales were primarily offset by
increases in purchased power from non-affiliates and, as a result, had no
significant effect on net income.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand, the
availability, and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increases for the quarter and
year-to-date 1998 compared to the same periods of 1997 resulted primarily from
increased purchases related to power marketing activities, a majority of which
were resold to non-affiliated third parties. These transactions had no
significant effect on net income.

     Maintenance expense. The increases for the quarter and year-to-date 1998
from the amounts recorded in the corresponding periods in 1997 was due primarily
to increased steam and distribution expenses. For year-to-date 1998, these
increases were offset by a decrease in nuclear expenses.

     Interest income. The second quarter and year-to-date increases are
attributed to the recording of ALABAMA's portion ($11.5 million) of the tax
settlement between SOUTHERN and the IRS (for additional information, see Note
(H) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein), and increased
interest income of $7.9 million and $12.2 million, respectively, as a result of
appreciation of investments held by the nuclear decommissioning trust. The
increases in interest income related to the nuclear decommissioning trust were
offset by a concurrent recognition of other interest charges in accordance with
FERC requirements.

     Interest on long-term debt. These increases for the quarter and
year-to-date 1998 compared to similar periods in 1997 primarily reflects the
sale of senior notes during December 1997 and the first six months of 1998.

     Interest on interim obligations. The second quarter and year-to-date
decreases are due primarily to a reduction in the amount of outstanding
short-term debt.

     Amortization of debt discount, premium and expense, net. The current
quarter and year-to-date 1998 increases from the same periods in 1997 are
attributed to ALABAMA's accelerated amortization of premiums incurred in
connection with the refinancing of high-cost debt, in the amount of $25.0
million, as allowed by the Alabama PSC. See Note (J) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further details.

     Other interest charges. The second quarter and year-to-date 1998 increases
are primarily due to interest charges related to the nuclear decommissioning
trust. These charges increased by $7.5 million and $10.5 million, respectively.
These increases in interest charges were offset by a concurrent recognition of
interest income in accordance with FERC requirements.

     Dividends on preferred stock. The decreases for the current quarter and
year-to-date 1998 compared to the same periods of 1997 resulted from preferred
stock redemptions during 1997.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in
the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     ALABAMA has assessed and developed a detailed strategy to prevent or at
least minimize problems related to the year 2000 issue. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued a new Statement of Position (SOP), Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The SOP, which must be adopted
by 1999, requires capitalization of certain costs of internal-use software.
Adoption of the SOP is not expected to have a material impact on the financial
statements.

     In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. This statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. ALABAMA is in the
process of evaluating the impact of this statement on its financial statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (F), (G), (H), (J) and (K) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first six months of
1998 included the addition of approximately $301.3 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Financing Activities

During the first six months of 1998, redemptions and maturities of first
mortgage bonds of ALABAMA totaled $198.5 million. In February 1998, ALABAMA
issued $200.0 million of 7% senior notes due December 31, 2047. The proceeds
were used to repay a portion of ALABAMA's short-term indebtedness. In April
1998, ALABAMA issued $190.0 million of 7% senior notes due March 31, 2048. The
proceeds were used to redeem $124.2 million of ALABAMA's First Mortgage Bonds, 8
3/4% Series due December 1, 2021 and to repay a portion of outstanding
short-term indebtedness.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     In June 1998, ALABAMA sold, through public authorities, $106.79 million of
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds due June 1, 2028. The proceeds
from these sales were used to redeem, in July 1998, $106.79 million aggregate
principal amount of pollution control revenue bonds.

     ALABAMA will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and
replace these securities with lower-cost capital as market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
ALABAMA under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital
requirements for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental
compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - - - - - - - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at June 30,
1998, approximately $20.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and had unused
committed lines of credit of approximately $807.6 million (including $315.0
million of such lines under which borrowings may be made only to fund purchase
obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds) with regulatory
authority for up to $750 million of short-term borrowings. At June 30, 1998,
ALABAMA had outstanding $30.0 million of short-term notes payable to banks and
$307.5 million of commercial paper.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of June 30, 1998, and the related condensed statements of income and
cash flows for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 1998 and
1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1997
(not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 11, 1998, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1997 is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

     Revenues. The increases in revenues were primarily due to increases in
energy sales within the service area for the second quarter and year-to-date
1998 when compared to the same periods in 1997. Revenues within the service area
increased by $204.3 million and $220.5 million, respectively, for the second
quarter and year-to-date 1998. The increases in energy sales were primarily in
the retail sector. Energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial
customers increased by 34.8%, 13.3% and 3.3%, respectively, for second quarter
and 22.1%, 9.3% and 2.6%, respectively, year-to-date 1998 due to the hotter
temperatures recorded during these periods as compared to the milder-than-normal
temperatures recorded in the corresponding periods in 1997.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     Retail revenues, excluding fuel and demand-side program revenues which
generally do not affect income, increased $152.4 million for the second quarter
and $175.5 million for year-to-date 1998. Wholesale revenues within the service
area, excluding fuel revenues which do not affect income, decreased $4.0 million
for the second quarter and $9.5 million year-to-date 1998 primarily due to a
scheduled decrease in capacity revenues under a power supply agreement with OPC.

     Wholesale revenues outside the service area decreased by $4.0 million for
the second quarter and increased $6.3 million year-to-date 1998. The decrease in
the second quarter was primarily due to capacity adjustments under long-term
contracts, partially offset by increases in energy sales. The year-to-date
increase was attributed to increased wholesale energy sales outside the service
area, primarily from power marketing activities. The increases in wholesale
energy sales outside the service area were primarily offset by the increases in
purchased power from non-affiliates and, as a result, had no significant effect
on net income.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. The increases for the current quarter and year-to-date 1998
when compared to the same periods in 1997 were due to increased generation
resulting from the higher demand for energy.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increases for the current quarter
and year-to-date 1998 were primarily due to an increase in energy purchases
resulting from higher demand and energy purchases related to power marketing
activities, a majority of which were resold to non-affiliated third parties.
These transactions had no significant effect on net income.

     Other operation expense. The current quarter and year-to-date increases
were primarily due to higher expenses associated with a new customer service
system implemented in January 1998, and modification of certain information
systems for year 2000 compliance. For additional information on the year 2000
issue, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings
Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.

     Maintenance expense. The increases in maintenance costs for the current
quarter and year-to-date are attributed primarily to a rise in costs associated
with steam plant and distribution line maintenance.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. The increases in depreciation and
amortization for the current quarter and year-to-date compared to the same
periods of 1997 are primarily due to increases in additional depreciation
charges of $127.1 million for the second quarter and $139.3 million
year-to-date, pursuant to a Georgia PSC retail accounting order discussed below,
and an increase in plant-in-service. See "Future Earnings Potential" below and
Note (L) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further
details regarding the retail accounting order.

     Amortization of deferred Plant Vogtle costs. These costs decreased for the
quarter and year-to-date due to the completion in September 1997 of the
amortization of levelized buybacks and Plant Vogtle Unit 1 cost deferrals under
the 1987 Georgia PSC order. See Note (M) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements", herein for further details.

     Interest income. The increases for the quarter and year-to-date 1998 are
attributed primarily to the recognition of $63.7 million in interest income
resulting from the resolution of tax issues between SOUTHERN and the IRS. For
additional information, see Note (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein.

     Other, net. For the second quarter and year-to-date 1998, the change was
primarily due to an increase in donations and contributions.

     Income taxes applicable to other income. The second quarter and
year-to-date 1998 increases resulted from taxes on the additional interest
income discussed above.

     Other interest charges. These charges increased for the quarter and
year-to-date due, for the most part, to the recognition of interest related to
tax issues.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary companies. The increase
in this item resulted primarily from the issuance of additional mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities in June 1997. For additional information, see
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Financing Activities" of
GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.

     Dividends on preferred stock. The decreases for the current quarter and
year-to-date resulted from the redemption of various issues of such securities.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in
the Form 10-K.

     Effective January 1, 1996, GEORGIA began operating under a three-year
retail accounting order. Under the order, GEORGIA's earnings are evaluated
against a retail return on common equity range of 10% to 12.5%. GEORGIA is
required to absorb cost increases of approximately $29.0 million annually during
the order's three-year operation, including $14.0 million annually of
accelerated depreciation of electric plant. Under the order, GEORGIA filed a
general rate case in June 1998. Reference is made to Note (L) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information.

     On January 14, 1998, the Georgia PSC ordered that GEORGIA be allowed
approximately $108 million of its $143 million investment in the Rocky Mountain
pumped storage hydroelectric plant in rate base as of December 31, 1998.
Reference is made to Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.

     GEORGIA has assessed and developed a detailed strategy to prevent or at
least minimize problems related to the year 2000 issue. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.

     In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued a new Statement of Position (SOP), Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The SOP, which must be adopted
by 1999, requires capitalization of certain costs of internal-use software.
Adoption of the SOP is not expected to have a material impact on the financial
statements.

     In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. This statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. GEORGIA is in the
process of evaluating the impact of this statement on its financial statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (F), and (L) through (O) in the "Notes
to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first six months of
1998 was the addition of approximately $207.8 million to gross plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations. See GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

During the first six months of 1998, redemptions of first mortgage bonds and
preferred stock by GEORGIA totaled $220.5 million and $40.7 million,
respectively. In January 1998, GEORGIA issued $145.0 million of 6 7/8% senior
notes due December 31, 2047. The proceeds from this issuance were used to repay
a portion of GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     In March 1998, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, $89.99 million
aggregate principal amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds with
$72.99 million aggregate principal amount due in 2024 and $17.0 million
aggregate principal amount due in 2025. The proceeds were used in April 1998 to
redeem $4.1 million aggregate principal amount of 6.20% pollution control
revenue bonds; $22.1 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% pollution
control revenue bonds; $17.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90%
pollution control revenue bonds; and $46.79 million aggregate principal amount
of 5 3/8% pollution control revenue bonds.

     GEORGIA plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Issues" in the
Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital requirements for its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - - - - - - - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at June 30,
1998, approximately $23.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$1.25 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. Of the $1.25 billion,
$980 million provides liquidity support to GEORGIA's variable rate pollution
control bonds. At June 30, 1998, GEORGIA had $151.9 million outstanding in
short-term notes payable to banks and $224.0 million outstanding in commercial
paper. Since GEORGIA has no major generating plants under construction,
management believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by
utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

                              ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP


                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of June 30, 1998, and the related condensed
statements of income and cash flows for the three-month and six-month periods
ended June 30, 1998 and 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1997
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 11, 1998, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1997, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

     Revenues. The increases in revenues were due to increases in territorial
energy sales and non-territorial wholesale energy sales. Revenues from
territorial energy sales increased by $10.7 million for the quarter and $7.1
million year-to-date. These increases are primarily attributable to increases in
retail energy sales of 15.8% for the quarter and 9.5% year-to-date due to
hotter-than-normal temperatures as compared to the milder-than-normal
temperatures recorded in the same periods in 1997. Revenues from non-territorial
wholesale energy sales increased by $3.9 million for the quarter and $3.4
million year-to-date when compared to the same periods of 1997. The increase in
non-territorial wholesale energy sales was primarily offset by the increase in
purchased power from non-affiliates and, as a result, had no significant effect
on net income. Retail revenues, excluding those revenues which represent the
recovery of fuel expense and certain other expenses and do not affect income,
increased $15.9 million for the quarter and $16.4 million year-to-date.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. These expenses increased for the quarter and year-to-date due
primarily to increased generation resulting from a higher demand for energy.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increases in purchased power from
non-affiliates when compared to the same periods in 1997 can primarily be
attributed to an increase in energy purchases resulting from hotter-than-normal
weather.

     Other operation expense. For the quarter and year-to-date 1998, these
expenses increased when compared to the same periods in 1997 primarily due to
increases in production, customer accounts, and administrative and general
expenses. This was partially offset by a decrease in amortization costs related
to the buyout and renegotiation of coal supply contracts.

     Maintenance expense. Maintenance expense increased when compared to the
corresponding periods in 1997 due primarily to scheduled maintenance performed
on production facilities at Plant Crist and Plant Smith during the first half of
1998.

     Interest on long-term debt. The decreases for the quarter and year-to-date
reflect the refinancing of $40.93 million of pollution control revenue refunding
bonds during July 1997 and a reduction in first mortgage bonds and other
long-term debt outstanding.

     Other interest charges. These charges increased for the quarter and
year-to-date due, for the most part, to the recognition of interest related to
tax issues.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary companies. See
"Financing Activities" herein for details relating to the January 1998 issuance
by Gulf Power Capital Trust II of its 7.00% trust preferred securities.

     Dividends on preferred stock. Current quarter and year-to-date 1998
preferred stock dividends decreased when compared to the corresponding periods
in 1997 due to the redemptions of preferred stock during 1997.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the
Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     GULF has assessed and developed a detailed strategy to prevent or at least
minimize problems related to the year 2000 issue. For additional information,
see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential"
of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued a new Statement of Position (SOP), Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The SOP, which must be adopted
by 1999, requires capitalization of certain costs of internal-use software.
Adoption of the SOP is not expected to have a material impact on the financial
statements.

     In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. This statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. GULF is in the process
of evaluating the impact of this statement on its financial statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (F) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first six months of 1998
included the addition of approximately $26.1 million to utility plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first six months of 1998, maturities and redemptions of first
mortgage bonds by GULF totaled $15.0 million. In January 1998, Gulf Power
Capital Trust II, a statutory business trust established for the purpose of
holding GULF's junior subordinated notes and issuing trust preferred securities
and common securities, sold $45 million of its 7.00% trust preferred securities
which are guaranteed by GULF. For additional information, see Note (I) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Sources of Capital" of GULF in the Form 10-K. The
proceeds were used to redeem $36.4 million of cumulative preferred stock and to
repay short-term indebtedness.

     In June 1998, GULF issued and sold $50.0 million of its Series A 6.70%
Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due June 30, 2038. The proceeds from the sale
were used to pay at maturity, in July 1998, $30.0 million outstanding principal
amount of its First Mortgage Bonds, 5.0% Series due July 1, 1998, and to repay a
portion of its outstanding short-term indebtedness. Such short-term indebtedness
was incurred in part to pay at maturity $15.0 million principal amount of First
Mortgage Bonds, 5.55% Series due April 1, 1998.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     GULF plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF
under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and
"Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of GULF's
capital requirements for its construction program, environmental compliance
efforts and maturing debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - - - - - - - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at June 30, 1998,
approximately $21.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $37.5 million of
unused committed lines of credit with banks in addition to $61.9 million
liquidity support for variable rate pollution control bonds. At June 30, 1998,
GULF had $14.0 million of short-term notes payable to banks. Since GULF has no
major generating plants under construction, management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second
quarter and year-to-date 1998 was $13.7 million and $22.1 million, respectively,
compared to $12.6 million and $23.3 million for the corresponding periods of
1997. The improvement in second quarter earnings is attributed to an increase in
operating revenues. The decrease in year-to-date earnings is primarily due to an
increase in operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

     Revenues. The increases in revenues were due to increased territorial
energy sales and non-territorial wholesale energy sales. Revenues from
territorial energy sales increased $18.0 million for the quarter and $18.5
million year-to-date when compared to the corresponding periods in 1997. The
increases in territorial energy sales are primarily due to increases in retail
energy sales to residential and commercial customers. Energy sales to
residential customers increased 31.3% for the quarter and 15.7% year-to-date
while sales to commercial customers increased 20.4% for the quarter and 11.2%
year-to-date primarily due to hotter-than-normal temperatures as compared to the
milder-than-normal temperatures recorded in the same periods in 1997. Revenues
from non-territorial energy sales increased $2.1 million and $4.7 million for
the second quarter and year-to-date, respectively. The increase in
non-territorial wholesale energy sales was primarily offset by the increases in
purchased power from non-affiliates, and as a result, had no significant effect
on net income. Retail revenues, excluding those revenues which represent the
recovery of fuel expense and certain other expenses and do not affect income,
increased $8.5 million and $9.3 million, for the current quarter and
year-to-date, respectively. Wholesale territorial revenues, excluding fuel
revenues which do not affect income, increased $2.2 million for the quarter and
$2.9 million year-to-date.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period

depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. Second quarter and year-to-date increases are attributed to
increased generation compared to the same periods in 1997 due to higher demands
for energy.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increases in purchased power from
non-affiliates are attributed to MISSISSIPPI exercising its option to purchase
summer peaking capacity, increased territorial demand and higher-than-normal
energy prices.

     Other operation expense. The current quarter and year-to-date increases in
other operation expense were primarily due to the amortization of the work force
reduction plan. See Note (G) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial

year-to-date result from increased short-term notes payable when compared to the
same periods in 1997.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment. Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in rates under
the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force on electric
rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking place.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. MISSISSIPPI's 1998 ECO Plan filing was approved, as
filed, by the Mississippi PSC on March 17, 1998 and resulted in a small decrease
in customer prices. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other
environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     MISSISSIPPI has assessed and developed a detailed strategy to prevent or at
least minimize problems related to the year 2000 issue. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued a new Statement of Position (SOP), Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The SOP, which must be adopted
by 1999, requires capitalization of certain costs of internal-use software.
Adoption of the SOP is not expected to have a material impact on the financial
statements.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. This statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. MISSISSIPPI is in the
process of evaluating the impact of this statement on its financial statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (F) and (G) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first six months
of 1998 included the addition of approximately $31.8 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first six months of 1998, maturities and redemptions of preferred
stock and first mortgage bonds for MISSISSIPPI totaled $35.0 million.

     In May 1998, MISSISSIPPI sold through public authorities, $13.52 million of
variable rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds due May 1, 2028. The
proceeds were used to redeem $13.0 million of the 6.20% Series pollution control
revenue bonds and to pay certain costs of issuance. Also in May 1998,
MISSISSIPPI sold $35.0 million of its Series B 6.05% Senior Notes due May 1,
2003 and $55.0 million of its Series A 6.75% Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due
June 30, 2038. The proceeds from these sales were used to repay MISSISSIPPI's
outstanding short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.
For additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Sources of Capital" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of
MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its construction program, environmental
compliance efforts, sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - - - - - - - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at June
30, 1998, approximately $31.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $76.3 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks
(including $10.9 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made
only to fund purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control
bonds). At June 30, 1998, MISSISSIPPI had no short-term notes payable
outstanding. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
and year-to-date 1998 was $7.8 million and $10.2 million, respectively, as
compared to $5.1 million and $7.7 million for the corresponding periods of 1997.
The increases in earnings for the second quarter and year-to-date were due to
increases in operating revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>

     Revenues. The increases in revenues are attributed to higher territorial
energy sales and non-territorial wholesale energy sales. Territorial revenues
increased by $15.6 million for the second quarter and $20.3 million year-to-date
due to increases in retail energy sales. For the quarter and year-to-date 1998,
retail energy sales increased by 19.0% and 12.6%, respectively, reflecting
hotter-than-normal temperatures as compared to the milder-than-normal
temperatures recorded in the same periods in 1997. Retail revenues, excluding
those revenues which represent the recovery of fuel expense and do not affect
income, increased $7.4 million for the quarter and $8.8 million year-to-date.

     Fuel expenses. Second quarter and year-to-date 1998 increases are
attributed to the higher demand for energy during these periods.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increase in purchased power from
non-affiliates is primarily attributed to an increase in energy purchases
related to increased power marketing activities, a majority of which were resold
to non-affiliated third parties. These transactions had no significant effect on
net income.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power from affiliates. Purchases of energy within the Southern
electric system will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Maintenance expense. The increases for the current quarter and year-to-date
1998 when compared to the corresponding periods in 1997 are a result of the
Plant Kraft Unit 3 scheduled turbine outage and boiler outages at Plants Kraft
and McIntosh.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     In June 1998, the Georgia PSC approved and adopted a modified stipulation
between the Georgia PSC and SAVANNAH, resolving the issues in the SAVANNAH
earnings review. See Note (P) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" for additional information.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH
in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     SAVANNAH has assessed and developed a detailed strategy to prevent or at
least minimize problems related to the year 2000 issue. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued a new Statement of Position (SOP), Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The SOP, which must be adopted
by 1999, requires capitalization of certain costs of internal-use software.
Adoption of the SOP is not expected to have a material impact on the financial
statements.

     In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. This statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. SAVANNAH is in the
process of evaluating the impact of this statement on its financial statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (P) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first six months of
1998 included the addition of approximately $8.1 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See SAVANNAH's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

During the first half of 1998, maturities and redemptions of first mortgage
bonds by SAVANNAH totaled $30.0 million. In March 1998, SAVANNAH issued $30.0
million of Series A 6 5/8% senior retail intermediate bonds due March 17, 2015.
The proceeds of the sales were used by SAVANNAH to redeem in April 1998 the
$28.9 million outstanding principal amount of its 8.30% Series First Mortgage
Bonds due July 1, 2022.

     SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - - - - - - - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at June 30,
1998, approximately $7.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$29.5 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. At June 30, 1998,
SAVANNAH had $10.0 million outstanding of notes payable to banks. Since SAVANNAH
has no major generating plants under construction, management believes that the
need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)  The condensed financial  statements of the registrants included herein have
     been prepared by each registrant,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and
     regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of each registrant's management, the
     information   regarding  such  registrant  furnished  herein  reflects  all
     adjustments  necessary to present  fairly the results for the periods ended
     June 30,  1998 and  1997.  Certain  information  and  footnote  disclosures
     normally  included in  financial  statements  prepared in  accordance  with
     generally  accepted  accounting  principles  have been condensed or omitted
     pursuant to such rules and regulations,  although each registrant  believes
     that the  disclosures  regarding  such  registrant are adequate to make the
     information presented not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed
     financial  statements be read in conjunction with the financial  statements
     and the notes thereto included in each registrant's latest annual report on
     Form 10-K.  Certain prior period amounts have been  reclassified to conform
     with current period presentation.

         The condensed financial statements of ALABAMA and GEORGIA included
      herein have been reviewed by ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's independent public
      accountants as set forth in their reports included herein as Exhibit 1 to
      ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)   SOUTHERN's operating affiliates are subject to the provisions of FASB
      Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
      Regulation. In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no
      longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
      off related unrecoverable regulatory assets and liabilities, and determine
      if any other assets have been impaired. For additional information, see
      Note 1 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the
      Form 10-K.

(C)   The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
      practices of the electric utility industry--including
      SOUTHERN's--regarding the recognition, measurement and classification of
      decommissioning costs for nuclear generating facilities in the financial
      statements. In response to these questions, the FASB has decided to review
      the accounting for obligations related to the retirement of long-lived
      assets, including nuclear decommissioning. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
      SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial
      statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA under "Depreciation and
      Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)   SOUTHERN engages in price risk management activities. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS "Derivative Financial Instruments"
      and Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for a discussion of these activities. Activities for non-trading
      purposes consist of transactions that are employed to mitigate SOUTHERN's
      risk related to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate
      fluctuations. At June 30, 1998, the status of outstanding non-trading
      related derivative contracts was as follows:

      Effective in January 1998, Southern Energy and Vastar Resources, Inc.
      combined their energy trading and marketing activities to form a joint
      venture. Southern Energy's investment in the joint venture is accounted
      for under the equity method of accounting. SOUTHERN and Vastar have
      jointly made guarantees to certain counterparties regarding performance of
      contractual commitments by the joint venture. At June 30, 1998,
      outstanding guarantees related to the estimated fair value of net
      contractual commitments were approximately $125 million.

 (E)  Effective December 31, 1997,  SOUTHERN adopted FASB Statement No. 131,
      Disclosure  about Segments of an Enterprise  and Related  Information.
      SOUTHERN's  principal  business  segment  -- or its  traditional  core
      business -- is the five regulated electric utility operating companies
      that provide electric service in four southeastern  states.  The other
      reportable   business  segment  is  non-traditional   energy  services
      provided by Southern  Energy,  which develops and manages  electricity
      and  other  energy-related  projects  both in the  United  States  and
      abroad. In 1997,  non-traditional  domestic services included revenues
      related to energy  trading and  marketing.  As  discussed  in Note (D)
      above,  effective  January 1998,  that business is accounted for under
      the equity method and its revenues are not  reflected  below for 1998.
      Intersegment  revenues are not material.  Financial  data for business
      segments for the periods covered in the Form 10-Q are as follows:

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


      (Note) The all other category includes parent SOUTHERN, which does not
      allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category
      includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate
      disclosure. These segments include a wireless communication company and a
      developmental company for energy products and services. Non-traditional
      services exclude interest expense to parent SOUTHERN.

(F)   Reference is made to Notes 3 and 7 to each of the registrant's financial
      statements, except SAVANNAH's, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a discussion
      of the proceedings initiated by the FERC regarding the reasonableness of
      the return on common equity on certain of the Southern electric system's
      wholesale rate schedules and contracts and a
      discussion of the long-term sales agreements. On April 3, 1998, three
      customers under the long-term power sales agreements filed a complaint
      with the FERC seeking (a) to lower the equity return component in such
      agreements from the existing return rate of 13.75% and (b) to unbundle the
      transmission component of such agreements and instead take transmission
      services under SOUTHERN's open access transmission tariff presently
      pending before the FERC. The common equity return under these agreements
      is also subject to the ultimate outcome of the pending FERC proceeding
      commenced in May 1991 and discussed in Note 3. The final outcome of this
      matter cannot now be determined.

(G)   Certain of the registrants and other SOUTHERN subsidiaries have instituted
      work force reduction programs. The expenses recognized under these
      programs and the unamortized balance of expenses deferred under regulatory
      orders were as follows: (in thousands)

      redeemable preferred or capital securities as follows: (in thousands)

</TABLE>

      Substantially all the assets of each trust are junior subordinated notes
      issued by the related company in the respective approximate principal
      amounts set forth above. The notes of Southern Capital are guaranteed by
      SOUTHERN. GULF and SOUTHERN consider that the mechanisms and obligations
      relating to the preferred or capital securities issued for its benefit,
      taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by it of the
      respective trusts' payment obligations with respect to the preferred
      securities or capital securities.

(J)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to retail rate
      adjustment procedures.

(K)   In 1996, legal actions against ALABAMA were filed in several counties in
      Alabama charging ALABAMA with fraud and non-compliance with regulatory
      statutes relating to the offer, sale and financing of "extended service
      contracts" in connection with the sale of electric appliances. See Note 3
      to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for additional information.

(L)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information concerning a three-year
      accounting order approved by the Georgia PSC effective January 1, 1996.
      Under the order, earnings in excess of a 12.5% retail return on common
      equity are to be used to accelerate the amortization of regulatory assets
      or depreciation of electric plant. Accordingly, for earnings in excess of
      the 12.5% return, GEORGIA recorded charges of $135.5 million and $167.5
      million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 1998,
      respectively (presented in the accompanying financial statements as
      depreciation expense of electric plant and as an addition to the reserve
      for depreciation).

      Further, under the order, GEORGIA filed a general rate case in June 1998.
      In its rate case filing, GEORGIA proposes to extend the current accounting
      order for three years, with one-third of earnings in excess of a 12.5%
      retail return on common equity reducing rates while continuing to apply
      the remaining two-thirds to the acceleration of the amortization of
      regulatory assets or the depreciation of electric plant. GEORGIA also
      proposes a $50.0 million rate reduction for certain small business
      customers. A decision is expected by the Georgia PSC by December 1998.

(M)   Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to Plant
      Vogtle phase-in plans resulting from orders of the Georgia PSC. These
      Georgia PSC orders provide for the recovery of deferred costs within 10
      years. The unamortized balance of these deferred costs at June 30, 1998,
      was $34.8 million.

(N)  Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information  concerning the recovery
     by GEORGIA of its costs  associated  with the Rocky Mountain pumped storage
     hydroelectric  plant.  On January 14,  1998,  the Georgia PSC ordered  that
     GEORGIA  be  allowed   approximately  $108  million  of  its  $143  million
     investment  in the plant in rate base as of December 31, 1998.  GEORGIA has
     appealed the Georgia  PSC's order to the Superior  Court of Fulton  County,
     Georgia.  If such order is ultimately  upheld,  GEORGIA will be required to
     record a charge  to  earnings  currently  estimated  at  approximately  $25
     million,  after  taxes.  The final  outcome  of this  matter  cannot now be
     determined.   Accordingly,  no  provision  related  to  the  Georgia  PSC's
     disallowance has been recorded.

(O)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
      designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
      Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
      environmental contingencies.

(P)  On June 10,  1998,  the  Georgia  PSC  approved  for  SAVANNAH a  four-year
     accounting order. Under this order, SAVANNAH will reduce its Small Business
     4 rate by  approximately  $11.0  million  over the four  years;  expense an
     additional  $1.95  million for storm  damage  accrual over 4 years from the
     date of this order;  accrue $8.0  million in  accelerated  depreciation  on
     generating  assets,  which will be  accumulated  in a regulatory  liability
     account;  file  quarterly  surveillance  reports  and  agree not to file an
     application  to  increase  its rates  except  upon  significant  changes in
     economic  conditions,  capital  markets,  new laws or  regulation  or other
     reasons,  deemed  appropriate by the Georgia PSC. Further,  the order gives
     SAVANNAH discretionary  authority to expense an additional accrual to storm
     damage  reserve up to an annual  maximum of $1.5  million  from the date of
     this  order  and to  accrue  additional  accelerated  depreciation  up to a
     cumulative  cap of  $12.0  million  over  the 4 years  from the date of the
     order. The accelerated  depreciation  allowed under the order is to provide
     for the mitigation of potentially strandable costs.

(Q)  Mobile Energy (a wholly-owned  SOUTHERN  subsidiary) received notice in May
     1998 from a major  customer of the  customer's  intention to close its pulp
     mill in Mobile,  Alabama,  for which Mobile  Energy  provides  electricity,
     steam  and  other  services.  The  closure  of the mill  will be  effective
     September 1, 1999. The mill provided  approximately  50% of Mobile Energy's
     operating revenues for the quarter and six-month period ended June 30, 1998
     and for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  Mobile Energy is evaluating the
     announced  closure of the mill to determine  its options and the  potential
     impact on its business. In the event that a sufficient  alternative revenue
     source is not  obtained,  the mill  closure  will have a  material  adverse
     effect on  Mobile  Energy's  revenues,  and,  thereafter,  it will not have
     sufficient  cash flows to pay  principal  and  interest on its senior debt,
     including $238 million of first  mortgage bonds and $85 million  related to
     tax-exempt bonds. There can be no assurance that any available  alternative
     will permit Mobile Energy to pay its debt service. At June 30, 1998, Mobile
     Energy had total  assets of $396  million  and equity of $18  million.  The
     ultimate outcome of this situation cannot now be determined.

Item 1.          Legal Proceedings.

           (1)   In August 1998, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
                 Circuit denied a consumer group's petition for review of the
                 order of the SEC which in effect permits SOUTHERN to use the
                 proceeds from financings for investment in "exempt wholesale
                 generators" and "foreign utility companies" (each as defined in
