           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

         This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements
in addition to historical information. In some cases, forward-looking statements
can be identified by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expects,"
"plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or
"continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. The
registrants caution that there are various important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking
statements; accordingly, there can be no assurance that such indicated results
will be realized. These factors include the impact of recent and future federal
and state regulatory change, including legislative and regulatory initiatives
regarding deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry and
also changes in environmental and other laws and regulations to which SOUTHERN
and its subsidiaries are subject, as well as changes in application of existing
laws and regulations; current and future litigation, including the pending EPA
civil action against GEORGIA and potentially other of SOUTHERN's subsidiaries
and the diversity litigation against certain of SOUTHERN's subsidiaries; the
extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets of
SOUTHERN's subsidiaries; potential business strategies, including acquisitions
or dispositions of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured to be completed
or beneficial; internal restructuring or other restructuring options, that may
be pursued by the registrants; state and federal rate regulation in the United
States and in foreign countries in which the subsidiaries operate; political,
legal and economic conditions and developments in the United States and in
foreign countries in which the subsidiaries operate; financial market conditions
and the results of financing efforts; changes in commodity prices and interest
rates; weather and other natural phenomena; the performance of projects
undertaken by the non-traditional business and the success of efforts to invest
in and develop new opportunities; the ability of SOUTHERN to obtain additional
generating capacity at competitive prices; the ability of SOUTHERN to meet the
conditions to the spin-off of Southern Energy, which include regulatory and
other approvals; and other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in other
reports (including Form 10-K) filed from time to time by the registrants with
the SEC.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   THIRD QUARTER 2000 vs. THIRD QUARTER 1999
                                       AND
                     YEAR-TO-DATE 2000 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 1999

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SOUTHERN's traditional business is primarily represented by
its five integrated Southeast utilities, which provide electric service in four
states. Another significant portion of SOUTHERN's business is represented by
Southern Energy, which develops and manages domestic and international
electricity and other energy-related businesses for SOUTHERN. Businesses
acquired by Southern Energy have been included in the consolidated statements of
income since the date of acquisition. Certain changes in operating revenues and
expenses from the prior period result from such acquisitions. Effective August
10, 2000, Southern Energy acquired the remaining outstanding 40% interest in
SCEM for $250 million. As a result of this transaction, SCEM became a wholly
owned indirect subsidiary and is consolidated in the accompanying financial
statements as of the effective date. Prior to August 10, 2000, SOUTHERN's
investment in SCEM was accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Reference is made to Note (J) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information on the SCEM acquisition. On
October 2, 2000, the initial public offering ("IPO") of 19.7% of Southern
Energy's shares was completed; therefore, effective as of that date, SOUTHERN's
financial statements will exclude the minority share sold in the IPO. Reference
is made to Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for additional information relating to the IPO and the planned spin-off of
Southern Energy.

Earnings

SOUTHERN's  reported  consolidated  net  income for the third  quarter  and
year-to-date 2000 was $614 million ($0.95 per share) and $1.2 billion ($1.85 per
share),  respectively,  compared  to $615  million  ($0.90  per  share) and $1.2
billion  ($1.67  per  share) for the  corresponding  periods of 1999.  Excluding
charges related to Southern Energy's transition to becoming a public company and
other  non-operating  items,  SOUTHERN's  earnings from operations for the third
quarter and year-to-date 2000 would have been $668 million ($1.03 per share) and
$1.25 billion ($1.92 per share),  respectively,  compared to $622 million ($0.91
per share) and $1.16 billion ($1.68 per share) for the corresponding  periods of
1999. The transition costs amounted to $45 million ($0.07 per share),  including
a charge of $17  million  ($0.03 per share)  related to  Southern  Energy's  tax
planning strategies,  which changed as a result of the IPO and planned spin-off.
This change involves the  repatriation of cash from Asia and will have an impact
on SOUTHERN in each quarter until the planned spin-off is completed.

Southern Energy's consolidated net income for the third quarter and year-to-date
2000 was $98 million and $292 million, respectively, compared to $156 million
and $305 million for the corresponding periods of 1999. Earnings decreased by
$58 million, or 37.2%, and $13 million, or 4.3%, for the third quarter and
year-to-date 2000, respectively, when compared to the same periods of the
previous year, primarily due to the sale of the SWEB supply business in the
third quarter of 1999, which increased prior year net income by $78 million, and
transition costs related to Southern Energy becoming a publicly traded company.
These decreases in earnings were partially offset by increased market demand and
strong performance from Southern Energy's assets and marketing and risk
management operations in California and New York as well as the commercial
operation of new plants in North America.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

For the integrated Southeast utilities, earnings were down by $7 million, or
1.2%, for the third quarter and up by $17 million, or 1.7%, year-to-date 2000
when compared to the same periods in 1999. The third quarter decrease is
primarily attributed to higher operating expenses which fully offset increases
in operating revenues. The year-to-date 2000 increase is primarily attributed to
increased operating revenues which were in large part offset by higher operating
expenses.

Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>

     Operating revenues. The increases in the operating revenues for the third
quarter and year-to-date 2000 are primarily attributed to Southern Energy.
Southern Energy's revenues were up by $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion,
respectively, for the current quarter and year-to-date 2000, when compared to
the same periods in 1999. These increases are primarily related to Southern
Energy's acquisition, effective August 10, 2000, of the remaining 40% of SCEM
which is now consolidated in Southern Energy's financial statements. Reference
is made to Note (J) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements"
contained herein for additional information regarding this acquisition. For the
integrated Southeast utilities, operating revenues were up by $151 million, or
5.0%, for the third quarter 2000 and $503 million, or 7.1%, year-to-date 2000
due primarily to increased energy sales to SOUTHERN's customers in the
Southeast.

     Fuel expense. For the third quarter and year-to-date 2000, fuel expense
increases are mainly attributed to Southern Energy's acquisition of SCEM, as
mentioned previously, higher natural gas prices and increased electricity market
demand at Southern Energy's plants in California, as well as commencement of
commercial operation of new plants in North America, partially offset by a
decrease due to the sale of the SWEB supply business, when compared to the
corresponding periods in 1999. For the integrated Southeast utilities, fuel
expense was up by $50 million, or 6.9%, for the current quarter 2000 and $157
million, or 8.8%, year-to-date 2000 as a result of higher energy demands and
higher natural gas and oil prices when compared to the same periods in 1999.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power expense.  During the third quarter and  year-to-date  2000,
this expense increased due primarily to Southern  Energy's  acquisition of SCEM,
partially offset by a decrease due to the sale of the SWEB supply business.  For
the integrated Southeast  utilities,  purchased power expense increased for both
the current quarter by $116 million,  or 56.6%,  and  year-to-date  2000 by $215
million, or 63.9%, due mainly to increased demand for energy.

     Other operation expense. The third quarter and year-to-date 2000 increases
are primarily attributed to Southern Energy. Increases in Southern Energy's
other operation expense result from the commencement of commercial operations of
new plants in North America and the Philippines, additional variable marketing
costs, increased market demand associated with Southern Energy's generating
plants in North America, the acquisition of the remaining 40% of SCEM, and
provisions taken related to revenues of the California operations under
reliability-must-run contracts. For additional information on the matter in
California, see Note (O) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements"
contained herein.

     Maintenance expense. For the integrated Southeast utilities, maintenance
expense was up $9 million, or 5.5%, and $28 million, or 5.1%, for the third
quarter and year-to-date 2000, respectively. These increases are attributed to
higher costs related to scheduled maintenance on steam and other power
generation facilities. Southern Energy's maintenance expenses increased during
third quarter and year-to-date 2000 by $4 million and $23 million, respectively,
when compared to the same periods in 1999 due primarily to the acquisitions in
1999 of generating assets in California and New York.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. For the integrated Southeast
utilities, this item increased $12 million, or 4.5%, in the third quarter of
2000 and $82 million, or 10.4%, year-to-date 2000 primarily as a result of
increased property, plant and equipment and accelerated amortization and
depreciation by GEORGIA in accordance with the three-year rate order approved by
the Georgia PSC. See Note (F) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for further details regarding the retail rate order. Southern
Energy's depreciation and amortization expense was higher for the current
quarter by $22 million and $66 million year-to-date 2000 due to the commencement
of commercial operations of new plants in North America and the Philippines.
Southern Energy's year-to-date 2000 increase is also attributed to the
acquisitions of plants in California and New York.

     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. The changes for both the
current quarter and year-to-date 2000 are attributed to Southern Energy. The
third quarter 2000 increase is mainly due to increased income from Southern
Energy's equity investments in China and in SCEM, prior to the acquisition of
the remaining 40% of SCEM in August 2000. The year-to-date 2000 decrease when
compared to the same period in 1999 is primarily related to the successful
resolution in 1999 of a dispute related to Southern Energy's operations in
China.

     Other, net. The decreases in this item for the third quarter and
year-to-date 2000, when compared to the same periods in 1999, are primarily
related to Southern Energy's gain on the sale of the SWEB supply business in
1999, which resulted in a gain of $286 million prior to taxes and other
expenses.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Interest on long-term debt. The third quarter and year-to-date 2000
increases are primarily attributed to interest on higher borrowings by Southern
Energy used to finance acquisitions, fund dividends paid to SOUTHERN and
commence commercial operations of new plants in North America and the
Philippines. The integrated Southeast utilities also contributed to these
increases due primarily to the issuances of senior notes by ALABAMA, during the
last half of 1999 and the second quarter of 2000, and GEORGIA and MISSISSIPPI
during the first quarter of 2000.

     Interest on notes payable. The increases for the third quarter and
year-to-date 2000 are mainly due to Southern Energy's increased borrowings to
finance business activities, as mentioned above. SOUTHERN also contributed to
the year-to-date 2000 increase due to a higher average short-term debt
outstanding and higher interest rates on these borrowings.

     Minority interests in subsidiaries. For the third quarter and year-to-date
2000, these items were lower due primarily to the sale of the SWEB supply
business in 1999, as mentioned previously. The year-to-date 2000 decrease was
partially offset by increased minority interest in income from operations in the
Philippines and South America.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment. For additional information relating to Southern Energy
and other businesses, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Southern Energy" and "Other
Business" in the Form 10-K. Also, reference is made to Note (N) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for information relating to Southern
Energy's IPO and the planned spin-off of Southern Energy.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs and on October 16,
2000, SOUTHERN and its five integrated Southeast utilities filed with the FERC a
proposal for the creation of a RTO. The proposal calls for the formation of a
for-profit company that would have control of the bulk power transmission system
of participating utilities, which will have the option to divest, sell or lease
their assets to the RTO. If the FERC accepts the proposal as filed, the creation
of the RTO is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements
of ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI, SAVANNAH or SOUTHERN. However, the
ultimate outcome of this matter is uncertain. For more information on the FERC's
rule, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Protection Agency Litigation" and Note 3 to the financial

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In June 2000, Southern Energy announced an agreement with Potomac Electric
Power Company ("PEPCO") to purchase PEPCO's generating business in Maryland and
Virginia, assume PEPCO's entitlements under various power purchase agreements,
operate two power stations in Washington, D.C. retained by PEPCO and supply
PEPCO with power required to meet its retail obligations for up to four years
pursuant to transition power agreements. The purchase price of this transaction
is $2.65 billion plus amounts to be determined for working capital and
reimbursement of capital expenditures, and approximately $260 million in the
event a certain power purchase agreement is not transferred to Southern Energy.
This transaction is expected to close later this year.

     On October 30, 2000, Southern Energy and PPL Global, through a
jointly-owned subsidiary, finalized the acquisition of Hyder plc. Hyder plc
provides water and sewerage, electricity distribution and other services to
customers in Wales. For additional information, reference is made to Note (R) to
the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" contained herein.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) through (G) and (J) through (S) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

New Accounting Standard

In June 2000,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 138, an  amendment of SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133, as
amended,   establishes   accounting  and  reporting   standards  for  derivative
instruments  and for hedging  activities.  SFAS No. 133  requires  that  certain
derivative  instruments  be recorded in the balance  sheet as either an asset or
liability  measured  at fair  value  and  that  changes  in the  fair  value  be
recognized  currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting  criteria are
met.  SOUTHERN  intends  to adopt the  provisions  of SFAS No. 133 on January 1,
2001.

     SOUTHERN utilizes financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes
in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. SOUTHERN also enters into
commodity related derivatives to limit exposure to changing prices on certain
inventory purchases and electricity purchases and sales. Upon adoption, these
instruments will qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, resulting in
the deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive income until the
hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness will be recognized currently in
net income.

     Substantially all of SOUTHERN's bulk energy purchases and sales meet the
definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133. In many cases, such transactions
will meet the normal purchase and sale exception and the related contracts will
continue to be accounted for under the accrual method. However, others will be
required to be marked to market through current period income. The majority of
such contracts are used by Southern Energy in its trading and marketing business
and are already being marked to market in accordance with existing accounting
requirements.

     Management continues to assess the effects of adopting SFAS No. 133, but
currently expects the impact to be immaterial to SOUTHERN's financial
statements. The application of SFAS No. 133 is still evolving and further
guidance from the FASB is expected. When established, this further guidance may
have additional impacts on SOUTHERN's financial statements.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first nine months of
2000 included $1.9 billion used for gross property additions to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were from
operations, short-term borrowings and other long-term debt. See SOUTHERN's
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details. Reference
is made to SOUTHERN's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income
herein for information relating to other comprehensive income.

Financing Activities

During the first nine months of 2000, maturities of the integrated Southeast
utilities' first mortgage bonds totaled $200 million. In February 2000, GEORGIA
issued $300 million of floating rate senior notes due February 22, 2002. The
proceeds of the sale were used to repay a portion of GEORGIA's outstanding
short-term indebtedness. In March 2000, MISSISSIPPI issued $100 million of
floating rate senior notes due March 28, 2002. The proceeds were used to prepay
bank loans of $45 million maturing in November 2001 and $5 million maturing in
October 2002. The balance was used to repay a portion of MISSISSIPPI's
outstanding short-term indebtedness. In May 2000, ALABAMA issued $250 million of
7.85% senior notes due May 15, 2003. The proceeds of the sale were used to repay
a portion of ALABAMA's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     In August 2000, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, $78.725 million
of 4.53% pollution control revenue bonds due September 1, 2030. The initial
interest rate is effective through March 1, 2002, at which time the bonds will
bear interest at either a variable rate or a new fixed rate. The proceeds were
used to refund $28.725 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% pollution
control revenue bonds which were called for redemption in October 2000 and $50
million aggregate principal amount of 4 3/8% pollution control revenue bonds
which matured on November 1, 2000.

     Reference is made to "Future Earnings Potential" herein for the discussion
of the agreement between SOUTHERN, through its subsidiary Southern Energy, and
PEPCO. To fund the purchase price of this transaction, Southern Energy plans to
enter into lease financing arrangements for a significant portion of the PEPCO
assets, which are expected to provide $1.5 billion; to issue $1.02 billion of
debt through one of its subsidiaries, of which approximately $938 million will
be drawn at closing; and to provide the balance from committed credit lines.

     See Note (K) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for discussion of certain financial derivative contracts entered into by
SOUTHERN.

     In April 1999, SOUTHERN's board approved the repurchase of up to 50 million
shares of SOUTHERN's common stock over the next two years through open market or
privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program was completed during
the first quarter 2000.

     The market price of SOUTHERN's common stock at September 30, 2000 was
$32.46 per share and the book value was $14.42 per share, representing a
market-to-book ratio of 225%, compared to $23.50, $13.82 and 170%, respectively,
at the end of 1999. The dividend for the third quarter of 2000 was $0.335 per
share.

Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for a description of the SOUTHERN system's
capital requirements for its construction program, sinking fund requirements and
maturing debt, and environmental compliance efforts. Approximately $342 million
will be required by September 30, 2001 for redemptions and maturities of
long-term debt. Also, the integrated Southeast utilities plan to continue, to
the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock
and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 2000, as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
integrated Southeast utilities plan to obtain the funds required for
construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past.
The amount, type and timing of any financings--if needed--will depend upon
maintenance of adequate earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market
conditions and other factors. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in
the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
September 30, 2000 approximately $835 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $5.9 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. These
unused credit arrangements also provide liquidity support to variable rate
pollution control bonds and commercial paper programs. At September 30, 2000,
the SOUTHERN system had outstanding approximately $3.5 billion of short-term
notes payable and $2.0 billion of commercial paper. Management believes that the
need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit
without maintaining large cash balances.

PART I

Item 3.       Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.


As part of its energy marketing activities, Southern Energy enters into a
variety of contractual commitments, such as swaps, swap options, cap and floor
agreements, futures contracts, forward purchase and sale agreements, and option
contracts. These contracts generally require future settlement and are either
executed on an exchange or traded as over-the-counter instruments. Contractual
commitments have widely varying terms and have durations that range from a few
days to a number of years, depending on the instrument.

     Southern Energy records all contractual commitments used for trading
purposes, including those used to hedge trading positions, at fair value.
Consequently, changes in the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets resulting from movements in fair value are included in revenues
in the period in which they occur. Contractual commitments expose Southern
Energy to both market risk and credit risk.

Market Risk

Market risk is the potential loss that Southern Energy may incur as a result of
changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. All financial
and commodities-related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to
market risk. Southern Energy's exposure to market risk is determined by a number
of factors, including the size, duration, composition, and diversification of
positions held and the absolute and relative levels of interest rates, as well
as market volatility and liquidity. For instruments such as options, the time
period during which the option may be exercised and the relationship between the
current market price of the underlying instrument and the option's contractual
strike or exercise price also affects the level of market risk. The most
significant factor influencing the overall level of market risk to which
Southern Energy is exposed is its use of various risk management techniques.
Southern Energy manages market risk by actively monitoring compliance with
stated risk management policies as well as monitoring the effectiveness of its
hedging policies and strategies. Southern Energy's risk management policies
limit the amount of total net exposure and rolling net exposure during the
stated periods. These policies, including related risk limits, are approved by
regional boards and are regularly assessed by management to ensure their
appropriateness given Southern Energy's objectives.

       Net notional amounts of electricity, natural gas and crude oil at
September 30, 2000 are as follows:

                             Net Notional Amounts        Unit of Measure

       Electricity                   5,050,659           MwH
       Natural gas                  16,872,820           MmBTUs
       Crude oil                    (1,027,319)          Barrels


     The determination of net notional amounts does not consider any of the
market risk factors discussed above. Net notional amounts are indicative only of
the volume of activity and are not a measure of market risk. Market risk is also
influenced by the relationship among the various off-balance sheet categories,
as well as by the relationship between off-balance sheet items and items
recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For all of these
reasons, the interpretation of notional amounts as a measure of market risk
could be misleading. The net notional amounts of Southern Energy's other
commodity positions were immaterial at September 30, 2000.

Item 3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. (Continued)


     The fair values of Southern Energy's assets from risk management activities
recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2000
were comprised primarily of approximately 43% electricity and 48% natural gas.
The fair values of the liabilities from risk management activities recorded in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2000 were
comprised primarily of approximately 48% electricity and 44% natural gas.

Credit Risk

In conducting its energy marketing and risk management activities, Southern
Energy regularly transacts business with a broad range of entities and a wide
variety of end users, trading companies, and financial institutions. Credit risk
is measured by the loss Southern Energy would record if its counterparties
failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations and the
value of collateral held, if any, were not adequate to cover such losses.
Southern Energy has established controls to determine and monitor the
creditworthiness of counterparties, as well as the quality of pledged
collateral, and uses master netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate
Southern Energy's exposure to counterparty credit risk. Master netting
agreements enable Southern Energy to net certain assets and liabilities by
counterparty. Southern Energy also nets across product lines and against cash
collateral, provided such provisions are established in the master netting and
cash collateral agreements. Additionally, Southern Energy may require
counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.

     Concentrations of credit risk from financial instruments, including
contractual commitments, exist when groups of counterparties have similar
business characteristics or are engaged in like activities that would cause
their ability to meet their contractual commitments to be adversely affected, in
a similar manner, by changes in the economy or other market conditions. Southern
Energy monitors credit risk on both an individual basis and a group counterparty
basis.

     No single counterparty represents 10% or more of Southern Energy's credit
exposure at September 30, 2000. Southern Energy's overall exposure to credit
risk may be impacted, either positively or negatively, because its
counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory, or
other conditions.

Financial Instruments" and Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in
Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Additional reference is made to Note (K) in the "Notes
to the Condensed Financial Statements" contained herein for additional
information regarding commodity-related marketing and price risk management
activities.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter
and year-to-date 2000 was $208.7 million and $379.4 million, respectively,
compared to $200.8 million and $356.9 million for the corresponding periods of
1999. Earnings for the current quarter 2000 increased $7.9 million, or 3.9%, due
primarily to a decrease in non-fuel operation expenses. Year-to-date, earnings
increased $22.5 million, or 6.3%, due primarily to an increase in retail sales.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

</TABLE>

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenues were relatively unchanged for the third quarter
2000 when compared to the same period in 1999. The increase in year-to-date 2000
retail sales revenue, excluding fuel revenue, is primarily due to increased
energy sales of 2.9%.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies within the SOUTHERN system, as
well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

                              ALABAMA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel expense. Increased generation from gas-fueled plants at a time of
increased natural gas prices resulted in higher fuel expense for the third
quarter and year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same periods in 1999. Since
energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues, these expenses do not
have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. Purchased power from non-affiliates
increased for the current quarter 2000 due primarily to higher costs associated
with these energy purchases and to offset decreased hydro power generation.
Hydro power generation was lower as a result of hot, dry weather in ALABAMA's
service territory. The year-to-date 2000 increase was to offset decreased
nuclear and hydro power generation related to a refueling and steam generator
replacement outage and lower stream flows, respectively.

     Other operation expense. These costs were lower for the current quarter and
year-to-date 2000, when compared to the corresponding periods in 1999, due
primarily to a decrease in administrative and general expenses. Lower
administrative and general expenses for the third quarter and year-to-date 2000
are due to a reduction in computer-related expenses and a decrease in expenses
associated with employee benefits. The year-to-date 2000 decrease in
administrative and general expenses also includes a nuclear insurance refund.

     Depreciation and amortization. The third quarter and year-to-date 2000
increases are attributed to increased property, plant and equipment when
compared to the same periods in 1999.

     Interest income. The current quarter and year-to-date 2000 decreases are
primarily due to gains recognized in 1999 on investments held by the nuclear
decommissioning trusts which were offset by a concurrent reduction of other
interest charges in accordance with FERC requirements.

     Other, net. Third quarter and year-to-date 2000 increases are primarily
attributed to an increase in Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and a
gain on disposition of property.

     Interest on long-term debt. Interest on long-term debt increased in the
third quarter and year-to-date 2000 primarily due to the issuances of $450
million of senior notes in the last half of 1999 and $250 million in the second
quarter of 2000.

     Other interest charges, net. The third quarter and year-to-date 2000
decreases result from an increase in Allowance for Funds Used During
Construction resulting in a larger credit to interest expense than was recorded
in the corresponding periods for 1999. Additionally, there was a decrease in
interest charges related to the nuclear decommissioning trusts, which was offset
by a concurrent reduction of interest income in accordance with FERC
requirements.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, ALABAMA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs and on October 16,
2000, SOUTHERN and its five integrated Southeast utilities filed with the FERC a
proposal for the creation of a RTO. The proposal calls for the formation of a
for-profit company that would have control of the bulk power transmission system
of participating utilities, which will have the option to divest, sell or lease
their assets to the RTO. If the FERC accepts the proposal as filed, the creation
of the RTO is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements
of ALABAMA. However, the ultimate outcome of this matter is uncertain. For more
information on the FERC's rule, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in the Form
10-K.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of ALABAMA in the
Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (D) and (E) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

New Accounting Standard

In June 2000, the FASB issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
(SFAS) No.  138,  an  amendment  of SFAS No.  133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments  and Hedging  Activities."  SFAS No.  133,  as amended,  establishes
accounting and reporting  standards for derivative  instruments  and for hedging
activities.  SFAS No.  133  requires  that  certain  derivative  instruments  be
recorded in the balance  sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at fair
value and that  changes in the fair value be  recognized  currently  in earnings
unless specific hedge accounting  criteria are met. ALABAMA intends to adopt the
provisions of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001.

     Substantially all of ALABAMA's bulk energy purchases and sales meet the
definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133. In most cases, such transactions
will meet the normal purchase and sale exception and the related contracts will
continue to be accounted for under the accrual method. However, a limited number
of contracts will be required to be accounted for as derivatives in accordance
with SFAS No. 133. Upon adoption, certain of these contracts will qualify as
cash flow hedges, resulting in the deferral of related gains and losses in other
comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness
will be recognized currently in net income.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Management continues to assess the effects of adopting SFAS No. 133, but
currently expects the impact to be immaterial to ALABAMA's financial statements.
The application of SFAS No. 133 is still evolving and further guidance from the
FASB is expected. When established, this further guidance may have additional
impacts on ALABAMA's financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first nine months of
2000 included the addition of approximately $622.5 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. See ALABAMA's
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first nine months of 2000, maturities of first mortgage bonds by
ALABAMA totaled $100 million. In May 2000, ALABAMA issued $250 million of 7.85%
senior notes due May 15, 2003. The proceeds of the sale were used to repay a
portion of ALABAMA's outstanding short-term indebtedness. ALABAMA will continue
to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital as market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of ALABAMA
under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital requirements
for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental compliance
efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at September
30, 2000 approximately $28.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, had unused
committed lines of credit of approximately $924 million (including $418 million
of such lines under which borrowings may be made only to fund purchase
obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds) and an extendible
commercial note program. ALABAMA has regulatory authority for up to $750 million
of short-term borrowings. At September 30, 2000, ALABAMA had outstanding $142.4
million of commercial paper.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of September 30, 2000, and the related condensed statements of income
for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 and
cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2000 and 1999. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of
December 31, 1999 (not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 16,
2000, we expressed an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the
information set forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December
31, 1999, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance
sheet from which it has been derived.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter
and year-to-date 2000 was $283.5 million and $525.7 million, respectively,
compared to $296.4 million and $526.5 million for the corresponding periods in
1999. Earnings decreased during the third quarter due primarily to lower retail
revenues excluding fuel revenues, which generally represent the direct recovery
of fuel expense and do not affect net income.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

     Retail sales. Retail sales revenue increased for the third quarter and
year-to-date 2000 due primarily to higher fuel revenues, which generally do not
affect net income. Non-fuel revenues for the third quarter 2000 decreased $22.2
million primarily due to changes in pricing for large commercial and industrial
customers partially offset by increased sales of 1.1%. Year-to-date 2000
non-fuel revenues increased by $54.4 million primarily due to increased energy
sales of 4.2% partially offset by changes in pricing, as mentioned above.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. The third quarter and year-to-date 2000
increases in these sales to non-affiliates resulted from higher demand for
energy by non-affiliates. These transactions did not have a significant impact
on earnings.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel expense. Increased generation from fossil-fueled plants to meet higher
energy demands at a time of increased natural gas and oil prices resulted in
higher fuel expense for the third quarter and year-to-date 2000 when compared to
the same periods in 1999. Since energy expenses are generally offset by energy
revenues, these expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. For the third quarter and year-to-date
2000, this expense increased due primarily to increased demand for energy as
well as the drought in GEORGIA's service area, and increased prices for natural
gas and oil. These expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings since
energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues.

     Depreciation and amortization. For the third quarter and year-to-date 2000,
the increases in this expense were attributable to accelerated amortization and
depreciation required by the three-year rate order which became effective
January 1, 1999 and increased in-service property, plant and equipment. See Note
(F) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further
details regarding the retail rate order.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including weather, regulatory matters and energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GEORGIA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form
10-K.

     Effective January 1, 1999, GEORGIA began operating under a new three-year
retail rate order. Under the order, GEORGIA's earnings are evaluated against a
retail return on common equity range of 10% to 12.5%. In compliance with the
order, retail rates were decreased by $24 million on an annual basis effective
January 1, 2000. Reference is made to Note (F) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs and on October 16,
2000, SOUTHERN and its five integrated Southeast utilities filed with the FERC a
proposal for the creation of a RTO. The proposal calls for the formation of a
for-profit company that would have control of the bulk power transmission system
of participating utilities, which will have the option to divest, sell or lease
their assets to the RTO. If the FERC accepts the proposal as filed, the creation
of the RTO is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings. For additional information, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the
Form 10-K.

Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

New Accounting Standard

In June 2000, the FASB issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
(SFAS) No.  138,  an  amendment  of SFAS No.  133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments  and Hedging  Activities."  SFAS No.  133,  as amended,  establishes
accounting and reporting  standards for derivative  instruments  and for hedging
activities.  SFAS No.  133  requires  that  certain  derivative  instruments  be
recorded in the balance  sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at fair
value and that  changes in the fair value be  recognized  currently  in earnings
unless specific hedge accounting  criteria are met. GEORGIA intends to adopt the
provisions of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001.

     Substantially all of GEORGIA's bulk energy purchases and sales meet the
definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133. In most cases, such transactions
will meet the normal purchase and sale exception and the related contracts will
continue to be accounted for under the accrual method. However, a limited number
of contracts will be required to be accounted for as derivatives in accordance
with SFAS No. 133. Upon adoption, certain of these contracts will qualify as
cash flow hedges, resulting in the deferral of related gains and losses in other
comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness
will be recognized currently in net income.

     Management continues to assess the effects of adopting SFAS No. 133, but
currently expects the impact to be immaterial to GEORGIA's financial statements.
The application of SFAS No. 133 is still evolving and further guidance from the
FASB is expected. When established, this further guidance may have additional
impacts on GEORGIA's financial statements.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first nine months
of 2000 was the addition of approximately $728.1 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. See GEORGIA's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first nine months of 2000, maturities of first mortgage bonds by
GEORGIA totaled $100 million. In February 2000, GEORGIA issued $300 million of
floating rate senior notes due February 22, 2002. The proceeds of the sale were
used to repay a portion of GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness. In
August 2000, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, $78.725 million of 4.53%
pollution control revenue bonds due September 1, 2030. The initial interest rate
is effective through March 1, 2002, at which time the

bonds will bear interest at either a variable rate or a new fixed rate. The
proceeds were used to refund $28.725 million aggregate principal amount of 6
5/8% pollution control revenue bonds which were called for redemption in October
2000 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of 4 3/8% pollution control
revenue bonds which matured on November 1, 2000.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Issues" in the
Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital requirements for its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at September
30, 2000 approximately $43.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $1.8 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. The credit
arrangements provide liquidity support to GEORGIA's obligations with respect to
variable rate pollution control bonds and its commercial paper program. At
September 30, 2000, GEORGIA had outstanding $397.4 million of commercial paper.
Management believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by
utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of September 30, 2000, and the related
condensed statements of income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2000 and 1999 and cash flows for the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2000 and 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of
December 31, 1999 (not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 16,
2000, we expressed an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the
information set forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December
31, 1999, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance
sheet from which it has been derived.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter and
year-to-date 2000 was $26.4 million and $44 million, respectively, compared to
$28.6 million and $46.6 million for the same periods in 1999. Earnings were down
for both the current quarter and year-to-date 2000 primarily due to expenses
related to the discontinuance of GULF's appliance sales division.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

N/M - Not meaningful

     Retail sales. Excluding the recovery of fuel expense and certain other
expenses that do not affect net income, retail sales increased 2.1% during the
third quarter and 3.9% year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same periods of
1999. The main reason for the increase in retail energy sales is the growth in
the number of residential customers served by GULF.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. In the third quarter and year-to-date
2000, increased unit power energy sales were the primary cause of the increases
in sales for resale to non-affiliates when compared to the same periods in 1999.
This energy is usually sold at variable cost and has no significant impact on
net income.

                               GULF POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. The third quarter 2000 increase in other revenues is
primarily attributed to higher revenues associated with the fuel, conservation
and capacity clauses. For the year-to-date 2000, these revenues were down due
mainly to a decrease in fuel, conservation and capacity clause revenues. The
changes in these revenues were a result of adjustments to reflect differences
between recoverable costs and the amounts actually reflected in current rates.
The recovery provisions generally equal the related expenses and have no
material effect on net income.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increases during the third quarter
and year-to-date 2000 are primarily attributed to an increase in capacity and
energy purchases to meet territorial and non-affiliated third party demand.
These transactions had no significant effect on net income.

     Taxes other than income taxes. Third quarter and year-to-date 2000
increases result from higher franchise fees and gross receipt taxes related to
increases in GULF's billed revenues. These collections are also included in
retail sales and other revenues and have no impact on earnings.

     Other, net. Decreases for the third quarter and year-to-date 2000, when
compared to the corresponding periods in 1999, result from expenses related to
the discontinuance of GULF's appliance sales division.

     Interest on long-term debt. The year-to-date 2000 increase, when compared
to the corresponding period in 1999, was mainly due to the issuance of senior
notes during the last half of 1999.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GULF is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the Form
10-K.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     On November 4, 1999, the Florida PSC approved GULF's plan to reduce its
authorized rate of return, reduce retail base rates and share revenues with its
customers. For additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs and on October 16,
2000, SOUTHERN and its five integrated Southeast utilities filed with the FERC a
proposal for the creation of a RTO. The proposal calls for the formation of a
for-profit company that would have control of the bulk power transmission system
of participating utilities, which will have the option to divest, sell or lease
their assets to the RTO. If the FERC accepts the proposal as filed, the creation
of the RTO is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements
of GULF. However, the ultimate outcome of this matter is uncertain. For more
information on the FERC's rule, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Protection Agency Litigation" and Note 3 to the financial
statements of GULF in the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (D) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.


New Accounting Standard

In June 2000, the FASB issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
(SFAS) No.  138,  an  amendment  of SFAS No.  133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments  and Hedging  Activities."  SFAS No.  133,  as amended,  establishes
accounting and reporting  standards for derivative  instruments  and for hedging
activities.  SFAS No.  133  requires  that  certain  derivative  instruments  be
recorded in the balance  sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at fair
value and that  changes in the fair value be  recognized  currently  in earnings
unless  specific  hedge  accounting  criteria are met. GULF intends to adopt the
provisions of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001.

     Substantially all of GULF's bulk energy purchases and sales meet the
definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133. In most cases, such transactions
will meet the normal purchase and sale exception and the related contracts will
continue to be accounted for under the accrual method. However, a limited number
of contracts will be required to be accounted for as derivatives in accordance
with SFAS No. 133. Upon adoption, certain of these contracts will qualify as
cash flow hedges, resulting in the deferral of related gains and losses in other
comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness
will be recognized currently in net income.

                               GULF POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Management continues to assess the effects of adopting SFAS No. 133, but
currently expects the impact to be immaterial to GULF's financial statements.
The application of SFAS No. 133 is still evolving and further guidance from the
FASB is expected. When established, this further guidance may have additional
impacts on GULF's financial statements.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first nine months of 2000
included the addition of approximately $67.1 million to utility plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

GULF plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost
debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital Requirements for Construction" and "Environmental Matters" in the Form
10-K for a description of GULF's capital requirements for its construction
program, environmental compliance efforts and maturing debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at September 30,
2000 approximately $1.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $61.5 million
of unused committed lines of credit with banks in addition to $61.9 million of
liquidity support for GULF's obligations with respect to variable rate pollution
control bonds. At September 30, 2000, GULF had $27.5 million outstanding of
notes payable to banks. Management believes that the need for working capital
can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large
cash balances.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third
quarter and year-to-date 2000 was $28.8 million and $47.7 million, respectively,
compared to $27.3 million and $49.5 million for the corresponding periods of
1999. Earnings for the third quarter 2000 were positively impacted by the $18.5
million, or 9.2%, increase in operating revenues which were partially offset by
increased operating expenses of $16.2 million, or 10.8%. Despite higher
operating revenues, year-to-date 2000 earnings were down due to an even greater
increase in operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

     Retail sales. The increases in retail sales revenue for the current quarter
and year-to-date 2000 when compared to the corresponding periods in 1999 reflect
increased total retail energy sales of 1.5% and 5.2%, respectively. These
increases for the quarter and year-to-date 2000 are primarily due to growth in
the number of residential and commercial customers.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. Third quarter and year-to-date 2000
increases reflect the continued economic growth in the areas served by rural
cooperatives in Mississippi.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel expense. Fuel expense increased during the third quarter and
year-to-date 2000 due mainly to the higher unit cost of fuel when compared to
the same periods in 1999.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. During the third quarter and year-to-date
2000, purchased power from non-affiliates increased as a result of increased
demand for energy when compared to the corresponding periods of 1999. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on net income.

     Other operation expense. The decreases for the third quarter and
year-to-date 2000 primarily represent reductions in sales and production
expenses.

     Maintenance expense. For the third quarter and year-to-date 2000, these
costs increased primarily due to scheduled maintenance performed on steam and
other power generation facilities.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. This item increased for the current
quarter and year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same periods in 1999 as a
result of additional distribution facilities and a new higher depreciation rate
approved by the Mississippi PSC.

     Interest on long-term debt. These interest payments were higher in the
third quarter and year-to-date 2000 due mainly to higher interest rates being
charged on a variable rate long-term debt outstanding.

     Other interest charges, net. The third quarter and year-to-date 2000
decreases, when compared to the corresponding periods in 1999, are primarily
attributed to lower interest related to tax assessments.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment. Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in
rates under the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force
on electric rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking place. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K. See Note (H) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for information regarding
an agreement between MISSISSIPPI and certain of its wholesale customers to
reduce rates and Note (I) for information on ratemaking and the allocation of
costs between wholesale and retail customers for both new and existing
generating facilities.

                            MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, MISSISSIPPI is positioning
the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. MISSISSIPPI's 2000 ECO Plan filing was approved, as
filed, by the Mississippi PSC on March 22, 2000 and resulted in a slight
decrease in customer prices. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs and on October 16,
2000, SOUTHERN and its five integrated Southeast utilities filed with the FERC a
proposal for the creation of a RTO. The proposal calls for the formation of a
for-profit company that would have control of the bulk power transmission system
of participating utilities, which will have the option to divest, sell or lease
their assets to the RTO. If the FERC accepts the proposal as filed, the creation
of the RTO is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements
of MISSISSIPPI. However, the ultimate outcome of this matter is uncertain. For
more information on the FERC's rule, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form
10-K.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in
the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     In May 2000, the Mississippi PSC ordered that its docket reviewing
restructuring of the electric industry in the State of Mississippi be suspended.
The Mississippi PSC found that retail competition may not be in the public
interest at this time and ordered that no further formal hearings would be held
on this subject. It found that the current regulatory structure had produced
reliable low cost power and "should not be changed without clear and convincing
demonstration that change would be in the public interest." The Mississippi PSC
will continue to monitor retail and wholesale restructuring activities
throughout the United States and reserved "its right to order further formal
hearings on the matter should new evidence demonstrate that retail competition
would be in the public interest and all customers could receive a reduction in
the total cost of their electric service."

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (D), (H) and (I) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

New Accounting Standard

In June 2000, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 138, an amendment of SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging  Activities." SFAS No. 133, as amended,  establishes  accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities.  SFAS
No. 133 requires that certain derivative  instruments be recorded in the balance
sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value and that changes in
the fair  value be  recognized  currently  in  earnings  unless  specific  hedge
accounting criteria are met. MISSISSIPPI intends to adopt the provisions of SFAS
No. 133 on January 1, 2001.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Substantially all of MISSISSIPPI's bulk energy purchases and sales meet the
definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133. In most cases, such transactions
will meet the normal purchase and sale exception and the related contracts will
continue to be accounted for under the accrual method. However, a limited number
of contracts will be required to be accounted for as derivatives in accordance
with SFAS No. 133. Upon adoption, certain of these contracts will qualify as
cash flow hedges, resulting in the deferral of related gains and losses in other
comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness
will be recognized currently in net income.

     Management continues to assess the effects of adopting SFAS No. 133, but
currently expects the impact to be immaterial to MISSISSIPPI's financial
statements. The application of SFAS No. 133 is still evolving and further
guidance from the FASB is expected. When established, this further guidance may
have additional impacts on MISSISSIPPI's financial statements.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first nine months
of 2000 included the addition of approximately $60.3 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. See
MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

In March 2000, MISSISSIPPI issued $100 million of floating rate senior notes due
March 28, 2002. The proceeds were used to prepay bank loans of $45 million
maturing in November 2001 and $5 million maturing in October 2002. The balance
was used to repay a portion of MISSISSIPPI's outstanding short-term
indebtedness. MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program
to retire higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" and Note 3 to the financial statements
in the Form 10-K for a description of MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its
construction program, environmental compliance efforts, sinking fund
requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


        To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at
September 30, 2000 approximately $182 thousand of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $82.3 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks.
At September 30, 2000, MISSISSIPPI had short-term notes payable outstanding of
$17 million. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income for the third quarter and year-to-date 2000 was $12.4
million and $20.3 million, respectively, as compared to $13.7 million and $20.2
million for the corresponding periods of 1999. Earnings for the third quarter
2000 were down due primarily to an increase in maintenance expenses.
Year-to-date 2000 earnings remained relatively flat reflecting an increase in
operating revenues which was partially offset by increased maintenance expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which do not affect net income,
retail sales revenue increased by $0.5 million for the current quarter and $6.9
million year-to-date 2000 due mainly to increases in total retail energy sales
of 1.8% and 5.6%, respectively. The increases in total retail sales, when
compared to the corresponding periods in 1999, are primarily attributed to
growth in the number of customers served by SAVANNAH.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. The third quarter and year-to-date 2000
increases primarily represent increased demand for energy during the third
quarter of 2000 when compared to the same period in 1999.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel expense. This expense decreased during the third quarter due primarily
to a decrease in the amount of energy generated as compared to the same period
of 1999. For the year-to-date 2000, fuel expense increased due principally to
higher gas prices and increased generation when compared to the corresponding
period in 1999.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. For the third quarter and year-to-date
2000, this item increased due to reduced generation by SAVANNAH and higher
demand for energy and higher purchased power costs. These transactions do not
have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset
by energy revenues.

     Maintenance expense. The third quarter and year-to-date 2000 increases in
maintenance expense were mainly due to a maintenance outage at one of SAVANNAH's
older plants and a major boiler outage at one of the coal plants.

     Interest on notes payable. The third quarter and year-to-date 2000
increases, when compared to the same periods in 1999, result from the increased
outstanding amount of short-term debt and higher interest rates in 2000.

     Other interest charges, net. The decreases in these charges for the third
quarter and year-to-date 2000, when compared to the same periods in 1999, are
related to a potential tax audit settlement accounted for in 1999.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SAVANNAH is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     In December 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs and on October 16,
2000, SOUTHERN and its five integrated Southeast utilities filed with the FERC a
proposal for the creation of a RTO. The proposal calls for the formation of a
for-profit company that would have control of the bulk power transmission system
of participating utilities, which will have the option to divest, sell or lease
their assets to the RTO. If the FERC accepts the proposal as filed, the creation
of the RTO is not expected to have a material impact on the financial

statements of SAVANNAH. However, the ultimate outcome of this matter is
uncertain. For more information on the FERC's rule, reference is made to Item 7

in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -

Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

New Accounting Standard

In June 2000, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 138, an amendment of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133, as amended, establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. SFAS
No. 133 requires that certain derivative instruments be recorded in the balance
sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value and that changes in
the fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge
accounting criteria are met. SAVANNAH intends to adopt the provisions of SFAS
No. 133 on January 1, 2001.

     Substantially all of SAVANNAH's bulk energy purchases and sales meet the
definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133. In most cases, such transactions
will meet the normal purchase and sale exception and the related contracts will
continue to be accounted for under the accrual method. However, a limited number
of contracts will be required to be accounted for as derivatives in accordance
with SFAS No. 133. Upon adoption, certain of these contracts will qualify as
cash flow hedges, resulting in the deferral of related gains and losses in other
comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness
will be recognized currently in net income.

     Management continues to assess the effects of adopting SFAS No. 133, but
currently expects the impact to be immaterial to SAVANNAH's financial
statements. The application of SFAS No. 133 is still evolving and further
guidance from the FASB is expected. When established, this further guidance may
have additional impacts on SAVANNAH's financial statements.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first nine months of
2000 included the addition of approximately $20.3 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations and credit arrangements with banks. See SAVANNAH's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at September
30, 2000 approximately $7.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $63.5 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks.
At September 30, 2000, SAVANNAH had $50.1 million outstanding of notes payable
to banks. Since SAVANNAH has no major generating plants under construction,
management believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by
utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)  The condensed financial  statements of the registrants included herein have
     been prepared by each registrant,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and
     regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of each registrant's management, the
     information   regarding  such  registrant  furnished  herein  reflects  all
     adjustments  necessary to present  fairly the results of operations for the
     periods ended September 30, 2000 and 1999. Certain information and footnote
     disclosures   normally  included  in  financial   statements   prepared  in
     accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United
     States  have  been  condensed  or  omitted   pursuant  to  such  rules  and
     regulations,   although  each  registrant  believes  that  the  disclosures
     regarding such  registrant are adequate to make the  information  presented
     not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed financial  statements
     of each registrant be read in conjunction with the financial  statements of
     such  registrant and the notes thereto  included in the Form 10-K.  Certain
     prior period amounts have been  reclassified to conform with current period
     presentation.  Due  to  seasonal  variations  in  the  demand  for  energy,
     operating  results for the periods  presented do not  necessarily  indicate
     operating results for the entire year.

     The condensed financial statements of ALABAMA and GEORGIA included herein
     have been reviewed by ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's independent public
     accountants as set forth in their reports included herein as Exhibit 1 to
     ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)  The integrated Southeast utilities are subject to the provisions of FASB
     Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
     Regulation. In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no
     longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
     off related unrecoverable regulatory assets and liabilities, and determine
     if any other assets have been impaired. For additional information, see
     Note 1 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the
     Form 10-K.

(C)  The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
     practices of the electric utility industry--including
     SOUTHERN's--regarding the recognition, measurement and classification of
     decommissioning costs for nuclear generating facilities in the financial
     statements. In response to these questions, the FASB has decided to review
     the accounting for obligations related to the retirement of long-lived
     assets, including nuclear decommissioning. Reference is made to
     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
     SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial
     statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA under "Depreciation and
     Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN,
     ALABAMA , GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form
     10-K for information on EPA litigation. On August 1, 2000, the U.S.
     District Court granted ALABAMA's motion to dismiss for lack of
     jurisdiction in Georgia and granted SCS's motion to dismiss on the grounds
     that it neither owned nor operated the generating units involved in the
     proceedings.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(E)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
     ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to a judgment
     against ALABAMA arising from discharges into Lake Martin. On August 4,
     2000, the Supreme Court of Alabama reversed the judgment against ALABAMA
     and the other defendants, and rendered a judgment in favor of all
     defendants.

(F)  Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information  concerning a three-year
     rate order approved by the Georgia PSC effective January 1, 1999. The order
     decreased annual retail rates by $262 million effective January 1, 1999 and
     by an additional $24 million  effective  January 1, 2000. The order further
     provides for $85 million each year, plus up to $50 million  annually of any
     earnings above a 12.5% retail return on common equity during the second and
     third years,  to be applied to accelerated  amortization or depreciation of
     assets. In May 2000, the Georgia PSC ordered that these funds be maintained
     in a regulatory  liability  account  instead of being applied to premium on
     reacquired debt as proposed by GEORGIA and ordered that interest be accrued
     on this  account at the prime  rate.  These  amounts are  reflected  on the
     balance sheets in deferred credits and other liabilities, other. Two-thirds
     of any  additional  earnings above the 12.5% return will be applied to rate
     reductions  and the remaining  one-third  retained by GEORGIA.  Pursuant to
     this  provision,  GEORGIA  recognized  accelerated  amortization  of  $25.9
     million in the third quarter and $113.8 million year-to-date 2000 and $21.3
     million in the third quarter and $63.8 million year-to-date 1999.

(G)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
     designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
     Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
     environmental contingencies.

(H)  In April 2000, MISSISSIPPI reached an agreement with certain of its
     wholesale customers to reduce its rates effective January 1, 2000. The
     agreement results in an annual rate reduction of approximately $3 million
     and a temporary annualized rate reduction of approximately $3 million for
     a period of 18 months ending June 30, 2001. In addition, MISSISSIPPI and
     its customers agreed that neither party would seek a unilateral change to
     the new rates prior to January 1, 2002, except for changes due to the
     operation of the fuel cost adjustment clause under the tariff. In July
     2000, the FERC accepted MISSISSIPPI's settlement with its customers as
     filed. The new rates were placed into effect in July 2000, and
     approximately $3 million in revenues collected subject to refund was
     refunded to the wholesale customers.

(I)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in
     Item 8 of the Form 10-K regarding the approval of new capacity. In
     September 2000, MISSISSIPPI and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff
     entered, and the Mississippi PSC in October 2000 approved, a new
     stipulation that modifies a January 1999 stipulation and order covering
     cost allocation. The 1999 stipulation and Commission order would have
     excluded the new capacity from retail ratebase and would have assigned
     MISSISSIPPI's existing generating facilities entirely to the retail
     jurisdiction. The new stipulation and order allocates a pro-rata share of
     the new capacity along with MISSISSIPPI's existing generating capacity to
     the retail jurisdiction.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(J)  In January 1998, Southern Energy and Vastar Resources, Inc. ("Vastar")
     combined their energy trading and marketing activities to form a joint
     venture, SCEM. Southern Energy's 60% investment in the joint venture was
     accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Effective August 10,
     2000, Southern Energy acquired Vastar's 40% interest in SCEM for $250
     million and began consolidating the results of SCEM's operations. As part
     of the transaction, Southern Energy was relieved of any financial
     obligations to Vastar under the SCEM partnership agreement, including any
     guaranteed minimum cash distributions and any outstanding arbitration.

(K)  SOUTHERN engages in price risk management activities. Reference is made to
     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Derivative Financial Instruments"
     and Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 of the Form
     10-K for a discussion of these activities. Activities for non-trading
     purposes consist of transactions to mitigate SOUTHERN's risk related to
     interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. At
     September 30, 2000, the status of outstanding non-trading related
     derivative contracts was as follows:

      Southern Energy engages in commodity-related marketing and price risk
      management activities. Southern Energy uses a systematic approach to the
      evaluation and management of risk associated with its marketing and risk
      management related commodity contracts, including value-at-risk ("VAR").
      VAR is defined as the maximum loss that is not expected to be exceeded
      with a given degree of confidence and within a specified holding period.

      Southern Energy uses a 95% confidence interval and holding periods that
      vary by commodity and tenor to evaluate its risks with respect to VAR.
      Based on a 95% confidence interval and employing a one-day holding period,
      Southern Energy's portfolio of positions had a VAR of $13 million at
      September 30, 2000. During the three-month period ended September 30,
      2000, the actual daily change in fair value never exceeded this daily VAR
      calculation. Southern Energy also utilizes additional risk control
      mechanisms such as commodity position limits and stress testing

      SOUTHERN has extended contingent performance guarantees and trade credits
      on behalf of SCEM. At September 30, 2000, outstanding guarantees related
      to the estimated fair value of SCEM's contractual commitments were
      approximately $358 million. In addition, Southern Energy has outstanding
      guarantees to various third parties totaling approximately $279 million at
      September 30, 2000.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


     Vastar and Southern Energy have issued certain financial guarantees made in
     the ordinary course of business, on behalf of Southern Energy's
     counterparties, to financial institutions and other credit grantors.
     Southern Energy has agreed to indemnify Vastar against losses under such
     guarantees in proportion to Vastar's former ownership percentage of SCEM.
     At September 30, 2000, such guarantees amounted to approximately $322
     million.

     Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
     Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 5 to the
     financial statements of SOUTHERN under the captions "Financial Instruments
     for Trading Activities" and "Energy Trading and Marketing Commitments",
     respectively, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(L)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item
     8 and to  Legal  Proceedings  in Item 3 of the Form  10-K  for  information
     relating to (i) petitions for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief which were filed
     in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Alabama and (ii)
     proposed  settlement  discussions among the affected parties.  At September
     30,  2000,  Mobile  Energy had total assets of $385 million and senior debt
     outstanding of $190 million of first mortgage bonds and $72 million related
     to tax-exempt  bonds.  In  connection  with the bond  financings,  SOUTHERN
     provided  certain limited  guarantees,  in lieu of funding debt service and
     maintenance  reserve accounts with cash. As of September 30, 2000, under an
     agreement with the  bondholders,  SOUTHERN had paid $41 million pursuant to
     the  guarantees.  SOUTHERN  continues  to have  guarantees  outstanding  of
     certain potential environmental and other obligations of Mobile Energy that
     represent a maximum contingent  liability of $18.5 million at September 30,
     2000. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.  On August
     4, 2000,  Mobile Energy and its immediate  parent,  Mobile Energy  Services
     Holdings,  Inc.,  filed a joint  proposed plan of  reorganization  with the
     bankruptcy  court.  That  proposed  plan of  reorganization  was amended on
     September  15, 2000.  If approved as proposed,  that plan would result in a
     termination of SOUTHERN's direct and indirect  ownership  interests in both
     entities.  That proposed plan of reorganization,  however, would not affect
     SOUTHERN's ongoing guarantee  obligations related to Mobile Energy that are
     described above.

(M)  In April 1999, SOUTHERN's board approved the repurchase of up to 50
     million shares of SOUTHERN's common stock over the next two years through
     open market or privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program
     was completed during the first quarter 2000.

(N)  On April 17, 2000, SOUTHERN announced that its board of directors approved
     an initial public offering of up to 19.9 percent of Southern Energy.
     SOUTHERN also announced that it is planning to spin-off to holders of
     SOUTHERN common stock the remaining ownership of Southern Energy within 12
     months of the initial public offering. The spin-off will be subject to a
     number of market and other conditions.

     On October 2, 2000, the initial public offering of Southern Energy was
     completed. Southern Energy sold 66.7 million shares of common stock,
     representing 19.7% of the 338.7 million shares outstanding, for gross
     proceeds of approximately $1.467 billion. Concurrent with the stock
     offering, Southern Energy also sold 6.9 million of convertible trust
     preferred securities for approximately $345 million in gross proceeds.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(O)  In March  2000,  an  administrative  law judge  ("ALJ")  held  hearings  in
     connection  with a FERC proceeding to determine the percentage of a settled
     $158.8 million revenue  requirement for Southern Energy's generation assets
     in  California  to be paid to Southern  Energy under  reliability  must-run
     agreements with the California  Independent  System Operator (the "CAISO").
     The  decision  in this case  affects  the amount the CAISO will pay for the
     period June 1, 1999 through December 31, 2001. Southern Energy had proposed
     to  allocate  approximately  75% of the  responsibility  for payment of the
     revenue  requirement to the CAISO.  On June 7, 2000, the ALJ presiding over
     this proceeding issued an initial decision  allocating  responsibility  for
     payment of  approximately  3% of the revenue  requirement to the CAISO.  On
     July 7, 2000,  Southern  Energy  appealed the ALJ's decision to the FERC. A
     final FERC order in this  proceeding  may be appealed to the U.S.  Court of
     Appeals. If Southern Energy is ultimately unsuccessful in its appeal of the
     ALJ's  decision,  it will be  required  to refund  certain  amounts  of the
     revenue  requirement  billed to the CAISO for the period  from June 1, 1999
     until the final disposition of the appeal.  The amount of this refund as of
     September 30, 2000 would have been  approximately  $118  million,  however,
     there  would have been no material  effect on net income.  This amount does
     not  include  interest  that may be  payable  in the event of a refund.  If
     Southern  Energy is  unsuccessful  in its appeal,  it plans to pursue other
     options available under the reliability must-run agreements to mitigate the
     impact of the ALJ's  decision  upon its future  operations.  The outcome of
     this appeal cannot now be determined.

(P)  On August 23, 2000, the FERC initiated an  investigation  of the California
     power  markets  after  denying a complaint  that sought to extend the CAISO
     market's  $250 price cap to all  California  energy and  ancillary  service
     markets.  On November 1, 2000,  the FERC released a Staff Report  detailing
     the  results  of its  investigation,  together  with  an  "Order  Proposing
     Remedies for  California  Wholesale  Markets".  The FERC  concluded in this
     order that the  California  power  market  structure  and market  rules are
     seriously flawed, and that these flaws, together with short supply relative
     to  demand,  resulted  in  unusually  high  energy  prices.  The order also
     proposed specific  remedies to the identified market flaws.  While the FERC
     concluded that it lacked the legal authority to order retroactive  refunds,
     it established  October 2, 2000 as the "refund  effective  date." Rates for
     service  after that date will remain  subject to a refund  condition  until
     December  31,  2002.  The FERC  will  receive  comments  on its order for a
     three-week  period and will issue a final order by the end of the year. The
     ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

(Q)  Reference is made to Note 13 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in
     Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information concerning assets for sale by
     Southern Energy. In August 2000, Southern Energy completed the sale of its
     assets in Argentina to The AES Corporation for $205 million, including the
     assumption of debt and the buy-out of minority partners. As part of the
     sale, Southern Energy was released from $200 million of credit support
     obligations. The sale had no material impact on the financial statements
     of Southern Energy or SOUTHERN.

(R)  On August 23, 2000, WPD Limited ("WPDL"),  through Southern Energy, made an
     offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hyder plc ("Hyder") for a
     total purchase price of approximately(pound)585 million (approximately $878
     million),  including fees and expenses,  or 365 pence (approximately $5.47)
     per Hyder  share plus the  assumption  of  approximately(pound)2.1  billion
     (approximately  $3.2  billion)  of gross  debt as of  March  31,  2000.  On
     September 15, 2000, WPDL committed  unconditionally  to purchase any shares
     of Hyder tendered by Hyder shareholders. As of September 30, 2000, WPDL had
     purchased  from  shareholders  approximately  71% of the Hyder  shares.  On
     October 30, 2000, WPDL finalized the acquisition of Hyder by making payment
     for the  additional  shares needed to bring WPDL's  ownership over 90%. The
     acquisition of more than 90% allowed WPDL, under UK company law, to acquire
     the remaining shares and on October 31, 2000, WPDL sent notification to the
     outstanding shareholders exercising this right.

     WPDL has replaced Hyder's board of directors with employees of WPD,
     Southern Energy and PPL Global. Following the completion of the
     acquisition, WPD will provide management oversight for WPDL's electricity
     distribution business. Southern Energy will make an equity investment of
     (pound)56 million (approximately $84 million) and will own 40% of the
     economic interest in WPDL and PPL Global will own 60%, with each owning
     50% of the voting interest. Southern Energy will also have a call right to
     acquire an additional 9% economic interest in WPDL from PPL Global. With
     the completion of the Hyder acquisition and with the approval of lenders,
     Southern Energy and PPL Global, effective December 2000, will modify their
     ownership of voting shares of WPD Holdings (WPD's parent) to 50% each so
     that neither party will have operational or management control of WPD
     Holdings. Therefore, the results of operations for WPD, which are
     currently consolidated, will be accounted for under the equity method as
     of that date.

(S)  SOUTHERN's principal business segment -- or its traditional business -- is
     the five integrated Southeast utilities that provide electric service in
     four states. The other reportable business segment is non-traditional
     energy services provided by Southern Energy, which develops and manages
     electricity and other energy-related projects both in the United States
     and abroad. Intersegment revenues are not material. Financial data for
     business segments for the periods covered in the Form 10-Q are as follows:

(1)   Cooper et al.vs. GEORGIA, SOUTHERN, SCS and Southern Company Energy
        Solutions, Inc.
      (Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia)

      On July 28, 2000, a lawsuit alleging race discrimination was
      filed by three GEORGIA employees against GEORGIA, SOUTHERN and
      SCS. The lawsuit also raised claims on behalf of a purported
      class. The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages
      in an unspecified amount, as well as injunctive relief. On
      August 14, 2000, the lawsuit was amended to add four more
      plaintiffs and a new defendant, Southern Company Energy
      Solutions, Inc., a subsidiary of SOUTHERN. The final outcome
      of this case cannot now be determined.
