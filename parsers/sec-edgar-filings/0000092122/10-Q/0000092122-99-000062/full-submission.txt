                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
                   THIRD QUARTER 1999 vs. THIRD QUARTER 1998

                     YEAR-TO-DATE 1999 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 1998

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SOUTHERN's  traditional  business is primarily  represented by its five domestic
electric  utility  operating  companies,  which provide electric service in four
Southeastern  states.  Another significant portion of SOUTHERN's business is its
non-traditional  business primarily  represented by Southern Energy,  which owns
and manages  international  and domestic  businesses  for  SOUTHERN.  Businesses
acquired by Southern Energy have been included in the consolidated statements of
income since the date of acquisition.  Certain changes in operating revenues and
expenses from the prior period result from such acquisitions.

Earnings

SOUTHERN's consolidated net income for the third quarter
and year-to-date 1999 was $615 million ($0.90 per share) and $1.153 billion
($1.67 per share), respectively, compared to $516 million ($0.74 per share) and
$1.029 billion ($1.48 per share) for the corresponding periods of 1998. Earnings
for the traditional business during the quarter were up $69.6 million or 14%
primarily due to increased revenues and lower operating expenses. Year-to-date
earnings for the traditional business were up $46.5 million or 4.9% due mainly
to lower operating expenses, primarily lower depreciation charges. For the
non-traditional business, during the quarter and year-to-date, earnings were up
$35.8 million and $102.4 million, respectively, due mainly to growing
profitability from its Asian business units and its investments in
power-generation businesses in New England, California and New York. In the
third quarter 1999, Southern Energy recorded several one-time items: a $78
million after-tax gain on the sale of its share of SWEB's supply business (the
distribution business is now named Western Power Distribution), a $16 million
after-tax charge at Bewag for costs related to early retirement and severance
packages and a $69 million after-tax write down of SOUTHERN's investment in
Mobile Energy. These items are recorded in Gain on asset sales, Equity in
earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, and Write down of investment in Mobile
Energy, respectively, on SOUTHERN's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

     Operating revenues. For the traditional business, operating revenues
increased by $14.5 million or 0.5% for the quarter and decreased by $245.8
million or 3.3% year-to-date. Quarterly revenues for the traditional business
were positively impacted by a 4.5% increase in retail energy sales and growth in
the number of customers. However, revenues for the current quarter and
year-to-date continue to be significantly affected by the retail rate reductions
ordered by the Georgia PSC. Operating revenues for Southern Energy were up for
the third quarter and year-to-date by $252.3 million or 58.1% and $324.6 million
or 23.4%, respectively. Southern Energy's revenues were up due mainly to results
from its recent investments in power-generation businesses in New England,
California and New York and were partially offset by decreased revenues from
SWEB and the deconsolidation of Mobile Energy. Effective with the bankruptcy
filing in January 1999, Mobile Energy is accounted for under the equity method,
rather than being consolidated as before. See Note (N) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further information regarding Mobile
Energy. Reference is also made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Non-Traditional Business"
and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential"
of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     Fuel expense. This expense increased for the third quarter and year-to-date
1999 due primarily to Southern Energy's acquisitions of power-generating
businesses in New England, California and New York.

     Purchased power expense. The third quarter increase is attributed primarily
to the traditional business where the demand for energy increased due to hot
weather and growth in the number of customers. The year-to-date decrease is
primarily attributed to Southern Energy, which recorded a decrease of $65.6
million or 11.0% mainly due to a decrease in purchased power at SWEB due to
volume reductions.

     Other operation expense. Third quarter and year-to-date increases are
mainly due to increased administrative and general expenses resulting from
Southern Energy's acquisitions since the corresponding periods of 1998 and an
increase in the bad debt expense reserve at CEPA.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. Third quarter and year-to-date 1999
decreases when compared to the corresponding periods in 1998 are principally
attributed to higher depreciation charges recognized in 1998 under the prior
accounting order and the completion in 1998 of the amortization of deferred
Plant Vogtle costs.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     Write down of investment in Mobile Energy. During this third quarter of
1999, SOUTHERN wrote down its investment in Mobile Energy due primarily to
recent settlement discussions with Kimberly-Clark Corporation and the
bondholders. For additional information, see Note (N) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein.

     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. The decrease for the
third quarter is due, in large part, to Bewag's provision for costs associated
with early retirement and severance packages. The year-to-date increase in this
item reflects the $54 million settlement of Southern Energy's claims against a
contractor relating to the Shajiao C construction project and the improvement in
profitability of the Shajiao C operations. The amount of the settlement of
contractor claims was partially offset by other related expenses included in
other income accounts and other operation expenses.

     Interest income. The year-to-date decrease is directly related to the 1998
settlement of tax issues between SOUTHERN and the Internal Revenue Service.

     Gain on asset sales. The third quarter and year-to-date increases are
primarily due to SWEB's sale of its supply business. Southern Energy's portion
of the total gain was $78 million, after taxes. For additional information, see
"Future Earnings Potential" herein.

     Income taxes applicable to other income. The third quarter and year-to-date
increases are mainly attributed to Southern Energy as a result of income taxes
related to the sale of SWEB's supply business.

     Interest on notes payable. The third quarter and year-to-date 1999
increases are attributed to increased borrowings related to Southern Energy's
acquisitions in California, New England and New York, repurchases of SOUTHERN's
common stock and other working capital needs. For additional information on the
stock repurchase programs, see Note (O) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein.

     Amortization of debt discount, premium and expense, net. These decreases
are related to accelerated amortization charges recognized in 1998 for premiums
incurred to refinance high-cost debt.

     Other interest charges. These charges decreased year-to-date 1999 when
compared to the same period in 1998 due to the recognition in 1998 of increased
interest related to tax issues between SOUTHERN and the Internal Revenue Service
which were settled during 1998.

     Minority interests in subsidiaries' income. The third quarter and
year-to-date increases in this item primarily represent PP&L Resources' minority
interest in the gain on the sale of SWEB's supply business.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment, with non-traditional business becoming more
significant. For additional

information relating to non-traditional business activities, see Item 1 -
BUSINESS - "Non-Traditional Business" in the Form 10-K.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein for
information relating to a complaint and notice of violation brought against
certain SOUTHERN subsidiaries at the request of the EPA.

     In April 1999, SOUTHERN, through its subsidiary Southern Energy, completed
the purchase of 3,065 megawatts of generating assets in California from Pacific
Gas & Electric for approximately $801 million.

     In June 1999, SOUTHERN, through its subsidiary Southern Energy, completed
its $484 million acquisition of 1,776 megawatts of generating capacity from
Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. and Consolidated Edison Company of New York.
Also, in June 1999, Southern Energy announced that SWEB had signed an agreement
to sell its supply business to London Electricity plc for $256 million or
(pound)160 million and the assumption of certain liabilities. Further, Southern
Energy acquired a 9.99% interest in Shandong International Power Development
Company Limited for $104 million. On September 30, 1999, the sale of SWEB's
supply business to London Electricity plc was completed and the distribution
business was renamed Western Power Distribution as the SWEB name was transferred
to London Electricity plc.

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which was originally to be adopted by the year 2000.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral
of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which amends FASB Statement No.
133 to be effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 (January
1, 2001 for companies with calendar-year fiscal years). SOUTHERN has not yet
quantified the impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements;
however, the adoption could increase volatility in earnings and other
comprehensive income.

YEAR 2000 READINESS

Year 2000 Challenge

In recent decades, computer programmers shortened the year portion of date
entries to two digits to save processing time and storage space. Computers
assumed, in effect, that all years began with "19." This practice was widely
adopted and hard-coded into computer chips and processors found in some
equipment. This approach was used until the mid-1990s. Unless corrected before
the Year 2000, affected systems and devices containing a chip or microprocessor
with date and time functions could incorrectly process dates or the systems may
cease to function.

     SOUTHERN depends on complex computer systems for many aspects of its
operations, which include generation, transmission, and distribution of
electricity, as well as other business support activities. SOUTHERN met its Year
2000 readiness goal, when in June 1999 it announced that systems critical to
generating and delivering electricity to its customers in the Southeast are
ready for 2000. Year 2000 ready means that a system or application is determined
suitable for continued use through the Year 2000 and beyond. Critical systems
include, but are not limited to, reactor control systems, safe shutdown systems,
turbine generator systems, control center computer systems, customer service
systems, energy management systems, and telephone switches and equipment.

Year 2000 Program and Status

SOUTHERN's executive management recognizes the seriousness of the Year 2000
challenge and has dedicated what it believes to be adequate resources to address
the issue. The Millennium Project is a team of employees, IBM consultants, and
other contractors whose progress is reviewed regularly by a steering committee
of SOUTHERN executives.

     SOUTHERN's traditional business refers to the integrated utility services
within Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. For this traditional
business, the work was divided into two phases. Phase 1 began in 1996 and
consisted of identifying and assessing corporate assets related to software
systems and devices that contain a computer chip or clock. The first phase was
completed in June 1997. Phase 2 consisted of testing and remediating high
priority systems and devices. Also, contingency planning is included in this
phase. The second phase was completed on schedule in June 1999. The Millennium
Project will continue to monitor the affected computer systems, devices, and
applications into the Year 2000.

     For the traditional business, SOUTHERN completed the activities contained
in its work plan by function as follows:

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     For the non-traditional business, Southern Energy has adopted a three-phase
plan to address the Year 2000 challenge at its North American and international
business units in which they have management control. The first phase consisted
of awareness and planning, inventory and assessment, and it included the
identification of potentially impacted systems and an assessment of their
individual Year 2000 readiness. The second phase, which includes testing,
remediation, and validation, consists of modification or replacement of impacted
equipment, and verification that those modifications have addressed the issue.
Contingency planning is the third phase, and it includes backup plans for
unexpected events with critical systems, staffing plans for critical date
rollovers, and plans to address external dependencies. Business units are using
Year 2000 readiness information received from suppliers, including fuel
suppliers, to determine if inventory adjustments are needed for the transition
period.

     The following three tables summarize the status of progress of Southern
Energy's North American and international business units as of September 30,
1999.

Year 2000 Costs

For the traditional business, current budgeted costs for Year 2000 readiness are
approximately $91 million, which includes $6 million of cost billed to
non-affiliated companies. These costs include labor necessary to identify, test,
and renovate affected devices and systems. From its inception through September
30, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized primarily as expense, amounted
to $82 million based on SOUTHERN's ownership interest. In addition to the
traditional business costs, current projections for Year 2000 program costs are
approximately $20 million for the non-traditional business - based on SOUTHERN's
ownership interest - of which $16 million has been spent through September 30,
1999.

Year 2000 Risks

SOUTHERN has implemented a detailed process to minimize the possibility of
service interruptions related to the Year 2000. Based on tests we have
conducted, we believe service interruptions related to Year 2000 challenges are
unlikely. These tests increase confidence, but do not guarantee error-free
operations. The company has taken what it believes to be prudent steps to
prepare for the Year 2000, and it expects any interruptions in service that may
occur within the traditional business service territory to be isolated and short
in duration, similar to service loss during a storm.

     SOUTHERN expects the risks associated with Year 2000 transition to be no
more severe than the scenarios that its electric system is routinely prepared to
handle. The most likely worst case scenario consists of the service loss of one
of the largest generating units and/or the service loss of any single bulk
transmission element in its traditional business service territory. There is a
smaller risk of sporadic and temporary fluctuations of power levels that would
be aggravated in the event of rapid and unscheduled changes to load patterns
that resulted from the activity of third parties. SOUTHERN has followed a proven
methodology for identifying and assessing software and devices containing
potential Year 2000 challenges. Remediation and testing of those devices is
complete.

     SOUTHERN continues to review the Year 2000 readiness of material third
parties that provide goods and services crucial to SOUTHERN's operations. Among
such critical third parties are fuel, transportation, telecommunications, water,
chemical, and other suppliers. There is some risk associated with
representations by third parties regarding their readiness and completion of
their own Year 2000 related work. Contingency plans based on the assessment of
each third party's ability to continue supplying critical goods and services to
SOUTHERN have been developed and are being reviewed.

     There is a potential for some earnings erosion caused by reduced electrical
demand by customers because of their own Year 2000 challenges. The risk
associated with the progress of some operations outside the United States is a
function of the local regulatory environment and the priorities of the entities
with management control. Year 2000 challenges are included in the list of due
diligence activities associated with acquisitions; there is some risk associated
with the subsequent validation of any given seller's representations.

Contingency Plans

Because of experience with hurricanes and other storms, the traditional business
is skilled at developing and using contingency plans in unusual circumstances.
As part of Year 2000 business continuity and contingency planning, SOUTHERN has
drawn on that experience to make risk assessments and develop additional plans
to deal specifically with Year 2000 challenges. SOUTHERN is identifying critical
operational locations, and scheduling key employees to be on duty at those
locations during the Year 2000 transition. SOUTHERN has already participated in
two successful North American Electric Reliability Council-coordinated national
drills during 1999, and plans to conduct additional drills. These drills focus
on SOUTHERN's ability to maintain critical voice and data exchange during
partial loss of primary voice and data communications systems. Because of the
level of detail of the contingency planning process, management feels that the
contingency plans will keep any service interruptions that may occur within the
traditional business service territory isolated and short in duration, similar
to service loss during a storm.

     Contingency planning efforts for the non-traditional business are complete
for North American assets and are near completion for international assets.
These contingency plans are being developed by utilizing consistent formats and
guidelines.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first nine months of
1999 included $1.7 billion used for gross property additions to utility plant,
$1.5 billion used for Southern Energy acquisitions and $649 million used for
common stock repurchases. The funds for these additions and other capital
requirements were from operations, sales of senior securities and short-term
borrowings. See SOUTHERN's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

     Reference is made to the SOUTHERN's Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Comprehensive Income herein for information relating to other comprehensive
income. During the first nine months, Southern Energy recognized $103 million of
after-tax foreign exchange translation losses in other comprehensive income
which were principally related to shifts in exchange rates between the U.S.
dollar and the pound sterling and the Deutschemark, and to the 50% devaluation
of the Brazilian Real.

Financing Activities

During the first nine months of 1999, retirements and redemptions of the
operating companies' first mortgage bonds and preferred stock totaled $1.2
billion and $86 million, respectively. In February 1999, Alabama Power Capital
Trust III, a statutory business trust established for the purpose of holding
ALABAMA's junior subordinated notes and issuing trust preferred securities and
common securities, sold $50 million of its capital auction preferred securities
which are guaranteed by ALABAMA. Also, in February 1999, Georgia Power

Capital Trust IV, a statutory business trust established for the purpose of
holding GEORGIA's junior subordinated notes and issuing trust preferred
securities and common securities, sold $200 million of its 6.85% trust preferred
securities, which are guaranteed by GEORGIA. Additionally, in March 1999,
GEORGIA issued $100 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due March 31, 2039. The
proceeds from this issuance were used to repay a portion of GEORGIA's
outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     In May 1999, ALABAMA issued $200 million of 6.75% senior notes due June 30,
2039. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of its outstanding short-term
indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. Also, in May 1999,
GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, $53 million of 5.45% pollution control
revenue bonds due May 1, 2034; $85 million of 5.40% pollution control revenue
bonds due May 1, 2034; and $100 million of 5.25% pollution control revenue bonds
due May 1, 2034. The proceeds of these sales were used to redeem $50 million
aggregate principal amount of 6.35% pollution control revenue bonds in June
1999; $125 million aggregate principal amount of 6.60% pollution control revenue
bonds in July 1999; and $60 million aggregate principal amount of 6 3/8%
pollution control revenue bonds in August 1999. In June 1999, ALABAMA sold,
through public authorities, $101.6 million aggregate principal amount of
variable rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds due June 1, 2022. The
proceeds from the sale were applied to the full redemption of the Series 1994 6
1/2% pollution control revenue refunding bonds in September 1999.

     In July 1999, Southern Energy issued $700 million aggregate principal
amount of senior notes which consisted of $200 million of 7.40% senior notes due
2004 and $500 million of 7.90% senior notes due 2009. Proceeds received from the
sales of these notes are being used for general corporate purposes, including
repayment of short-term debt.

     In August and September 1999, ALABAMA issued $250 million of 7.125% senior
notes due August 15, 2004 and issued $200 million of 7 1/8% senior notes due
October 1, 2007. The proceeds of both issuances were used to repay a portion of
its outstanding short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate
purposes. Also in August 1999, GULF issued $50 million of 7.05% senior notes due
August 15, 2004. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of its outstanding
short-term indebtedness.

     Reference is made to Note (O) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for discussion of programs to repurchase SOUTHERN's common
stock. As reflected in SOUTHERN's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows herein, for the first nine months of 1999, SOUTHERN has spent
approximately $649 million in connection with such repurchases.

     During the first nine months of 1999, SOUTHERN raised approximately $24
million from the issuance of 887 thousand shares of common stock under
SOUTHERN's various stock plans. The market price of SOUTHERN's common stock at
September 30, 1999 was $25.75 per share and the book value was $14.12 per share,
representing a market-to-book ratio of 182%, compared to $29.0625, $14.04 and
207%, respectively, at the end of 1998. The dividend for the third quarter of
1999 was $0.335 per share.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements for Construction", "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern electric
system's capital requirements for its construction program, sinking fund
requirements and maturing debt, and environmental compliance efforts.
Approximately $495 million will be required by September 30, 2000, for
redemptions and maturities of long-term debt. Also, the operating companies plan
to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and
preferred stock and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 1999, as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
September 30, 1999, approximately $768 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $5.8 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. These
unused credit arrangements also provide liquidity support to variable rate
pollution control bonds and commercial paper programs. At September 30, 1999,
the system companies had outstanding approximately $1.0 billion of short-term
notes payable and $2.4 billion of commercial paper. Management believes that the
need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit
without maintaining large cash balances.

     See Note (D) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for discussion of financial derivative contracts entered into by SOUTHERN.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    THIRD QUARTER 1999 vs. THIRD QUARTER 1998
                                       AND
                     YEAR-TO-DATE 1999 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 1998


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter
and year-to-date 1999 was $200.8 million and $356.9 million, respectively,
compared to $174.0 million and $334.7 million for the same periods of 1998.
Earnings for the third quarter increased $26.9 million or 15.4% due principally
to an increase in territorial sales combined with a decrease in non-fuel
operation and maintenance expenses. Year-to-date 1999 earnings increased $22.2
million or 6.6% due to an increase in territorial sales combined with decreased
non-fuel operation and maintenance expenses and decreased amortization of debt
discount, premium and expense, net.

</TABLE>


     Revenues. Including fuel revenues, revenues were up for the third quarter
1999 but were relatively unchanged year-to-date 1999 when compared to the same
periods in 1998. The primary reason for the third quarter increase in revenues
was an increase in territorial energy sales. Territorial energy sales also
increased year-to-date; however, the increase was substantially offset by a
decrease in revenues from unit power sales attributable to lower energy revenues
and a lowering of the equity return under formula rate contracts. See Note (F)
in the " Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further
details. Territorial revenues, excluding those revenues which represent the
recovery of fuel expense and certain other expenses and do not affect income,
increased $33.8 million for the current quarter and $25.5 million year-to-date.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The third quarter increase in this
expense is mainly due to the increased demand for energy. These expenses were
lower year-to-date 1999 when compared to the same period in 1998 due primarily
to increased purchases in 1998 related to power marketing activities, a majority
of which were resold to non-affiliated third parties. These transactions had no
significant effect on net income.

     Maintenance expense. These expenses were lower for the third quarter and
year-to-date 1999 primarily due to decreased expenses during the third quarter
of 1999 for maintenance of distribution lines and nuclear plant.

     Taxes other than income taxes. The increases in this item for the quarter
and year-to-date are due primarily to increases in real and personal property
taxes.

     Interest income. For the third quarter 1999, this item increased primarily
as a result of recognized gains on investments held by the nuclear
decommissioning trust. The increases in interest income related to the nuclear
decommissioning trust were offset by a concurrent recognition of other interest
charges in accordance with FERC requirements. The decrease for year-to-date 1999
mainly results from the recording by ALABAMA during the second quarter of 1998
of its portion of the tax settlement between SOUTHERN and the Internal Revenue
Service. For additional information, see Note 3 to the financial statements of
ALABAMA under the caption "Tax Litigation" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

     Amortization of debt discount, premium and expense, net. Third quarter and
year-to-date decreases are directly related to accelerated amortization in 1998
of premiums incurred to refinance high-cost debt. For additional information,
see Note 3 to the financial statements of ALABAMA under the caption "Retail Rate
Adjustment Procedures" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

     Other interest charges. The increase in other interest charges for the
third quarter is related to the nuclear decommissioning trust. These charges
were offset by a concurrent recognition of interest income in accordance with
FERC requirements.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, ALABAMA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Reference is made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein for
information relating to a complaint and notice of violation brought against
certain SOUTHERN subsidiaries at the request of the EPA.

     ALABAMA's plans to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been implemented and
are included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related to
ALABAMA's Year 2000 program, including ALABAMA's share of costs of Southern
Nuclear Operating Company, are expected to be $37.0 million. From its inception
through September 30, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized primarily as
expense, amounted to $28.3 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION - "Future Earnings Potential" herein.

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which was originally to be adopted by the year 2000.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral
of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which amends FASB Statement No.
133 to be effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 (January
1, 2001 for companies with calendar-year fiscal years). ALABAMA has not yet
quantified the impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements;
however, the adoption could increase volatility in reported earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), and (F) through (J) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first nine months of
1999 included the addition of approximately $563.9 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Financing Activities

During the first nine months of 1999, redemptions of first mortgage bonds and
preferred stock by ALABAMA totaled $470 million and $50 million, respectively.
In February 1999, Alabama Power Capital Trust III (the "Trust"), a statutory
business trust established for the purpose of holding ALABAMA's junior
subordinated notes and issuing trust preferred securities and common securities,
sold $50 million of its capital auction preferred securities which are
guaranteed by ALABAMA. The Trust invested the proceeds in Series C junior
subordinated notes. The net proceeds received by ALABAMA were used to repay a
portion of ALABAMA's outstanding short-term indebtedness. See Note (G) in the "
Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information.
In May 1999, ALABAMA issued $200 million of 6.75% senior notes due June 30,
2039. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of its outstanding short-term
indebtedness and

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


for other general corporate purposes. In June 1999, ALABAMA sold, through public
authorities, $101.6 million aggregate principal amount of variable rate
pollution control revenue refunding bonds due June 1, 2022. The proceeds from
the sale were applied to the full redemption of the Series 1994 6 1/2% pollution
control revenue refunding bonds in September 1999. In August and September 1999,
ALABAMA issued $250 million of 7.125% senior notes due August 15, 2004 and $200
million of 7 1/8% senior notes due October 1, 2007, respectively. The proceeds
of both issuances were used to repay a portion of its outstanding short-term
indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

     ALABAMA will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and
replace these securities with lower-cost capital as market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of ALABAMA
under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital requirements
for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental compliance
efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at September
30, 1999, approximately $44.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and had
unused committed lines of credit of approximately $906.7 million (including
$417.6 million of such lines under which borrowings may be made only to fund
purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds).
Additionally, in July 1999, ALABAMA entered into a $96 million extendible
commercial note agreement. ALABAMA has regulatory authority for up to $750
million of short-term borrowings. At September 30, 1999, ALABAMA had outstanding
$88.4 million of commercial paper.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of September 30, 1999, and the related condensed statements of income
for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 1999 and 1998 and
cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 1999 and 1998. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1998
(not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 10, 1999, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1998 is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    THIRD QUARTER 1999 vs. THIRD QUARTER 1998
                                       AND
                     YEAR-TO-DATE 1999 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 1998


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter
and year-to-date 1999 was $296.4 million and $526.5 million, respectively,
compared to $255.5 million and $498.1 million for the same periods in 1998.
Third quarter 1999 earnings increased by $40.9 million or 16.0% and year-to-date
1999 earnings increased by $28.5 million or 5.7% due primarily to decreased
operating expenses and the effects of the 1998 Georgia PSC rate order. See Note
(K) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further
details regarding the retail rate order.

     Revenues. Retail revenues, excluding fuel revenues which generally do not
affect income, decreased $75.0 million and $251.8 million, respectively, for the
third quarter and year-to-date 1999 when compared to the corresponding periods
in 1998 primarily due to retail rate reductions under the 1998 Georgia PSC
order. Total retail energy sales were up 3.9% for the third quarter and 1.5%
year-to-date 1999, but the associated revenues were down 4.7% and 6.9%,
respectively.

     Wholesale revenues decreased $2.2 million and $28.2 million, respectively,
during the third quarter and year-to-date 1999. The third quarter and
year-to-date decreases are primarily the result of reductions in capacity
revenues under a power supply agreement with OPC of $2.0 million and $13.5
million, respectively, for the third quarter and year-to-date 1999, and a
decrease in energy sales. The decreases in wholesale energy sales were primarily
offset by the decreases in purchased power from non-affiliates and, as a result,
had no significant effect on net income.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The year-to-date 1999 decrease
resulted from higher demand in 1998 for energy and higher energy purchases in
1998 related to power marketing activities, a majority of which were resold to
non-affiliated third parties. As stated above, these transactions had no
significant effect on net income.

     Other operation expense. The decreases for the current quarter and
year-to-date 1999 are primarily due to a reduction in the charges related to a
customer service system, decreased year 2000 readiness costs, and decreased
employee benefit provisions.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. These decreases in the third quarter
and year-to-date 1999 when compared to the same periods in 1998 are attributed
to higher depreciation charges recognized in 1998 under the prior accounting
order and the completion in 1998 of the amortization of deferred Plant Vogtle
costs.

     Interest income. The year-to-date 1999 decrease is related to the
recognition, in the same period of 1998, of increased interest income resulting
from the resolution of tax issues between SOUTHERN and the Internal Revenue
Service.

     Other, net. The third quarter and year-to-date 1999 changes are attributed
to reduced donations and contributions in these periods when compared to the
corresponding periods in 1998.

     Interest on long-term debt. The third quarter and year-to-date 1999
decreases are due to redemptions of first mortgage bonds and the refinancing of
higher cost long-term debt.

     Other interest charges. The year-to-date 1999 decrease when compared to the
same period in 1998 is attributed to the recognition in 1998 of interest related
to tax issues.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary companies. The
increases for the third quarter and year-to-date 1999 result from the issuance
of additional mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in February 1999.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including weather, regulatory matters and energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GEORGIA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form
10-K.

     Effective January 1, 1999, GEORGIA began operating under a new three-year
retail rate order. Under the order, GEORGIA's earnings are evaluated against a
retail return on common equity range of 10% to 12.5%. In compliance with the
order, retail rates were decreased by $262 million on an annual basis effective
January 1, 1999. Reference is made to Note (K) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings. The State of Georgia submitted a plan for nitrogen
oxide emission reductions in Atlanta's ozone non-attainment area on October 29,
1999. Based on the plan submitted by the State to the EPA, GEORGIA estimates its
capital costs to comply with the plan to be approximately $664 million. At the
direction of the EPA, the State of Georgia is required to pursue additional
control on all sources of nitrogen oxide emissions and volatile organic
compounds. The plan for those additional controls must be submitted to the EPA
by the fall of 2000. It is uncertain at this time what additional controls may
be required at GEORGIA's plants beyond the recently submitted plan. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein for
information relating to a complaint and notice of violation brought against
certain SOUTHERN subsidiaries at the request of the EPA.

     GEORGIA's plans to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been implemented and
are included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related to
GEORGIA's Year 2000 program, including GEORGIA's share of costs of Southern
Nuclear Operating Company, are expected to be approximately $42.8 million. From
its inception through September 30, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs,
recognized as expense, amounted to $40 million. For additional information, see
SOUTHERN's MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION - "Future Earnings Potential" herein.

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which was originally to be adopted by the year 2000.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral
of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which amends FASB Statement No.
133 to be effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 (January
1, 2001 for companies with calendar-year fiscal years). GEORGIA has not yet
quantified the impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements;
however, the adoption could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (F), (G), (K) and (L) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first nine months
of 1999 was the addition of approximately $516.8 million to gross plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

During the first nine months of 1999, redemptions of first mortgage bonds and
preferred stock by GEORGIA totaled $404 million and $36 million, respectively.
In February 1999, Georgia Power Capital Trust IV, a statutory business trust
established for the purpose of holding GEORGIA's junior subordinated notes and
issuing trust preferred securities and common securities, sold $200 million of
its 6.85% trust preferred securities, which are guaranteed by GEORGIA. (See Note
(G) in the " Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Financing Activities" of GEORGIA in the
Form 10-K for further details.) In March 1999, GEORGIA issued $100 million of 6
5/8% senior notes due March 31, 2039. The proceeds from this issuance were used
to repay a portion of GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness. In May
1999, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, $53 million of 5.45% pollution
control revenue bonds due May 1, 2034; $85 million of 5.40% pollution control
revenue bonds due May 1, 2034; and $100 million of 5.25% pollution control
revenue bonds due May 1, 2034. The proceeds of these sales were used to redeem
$50 million aggregate principal amount of 6.35% pollution control revenue bonds
in June 1999; $125 million aggregate principal amount of 6.60% pollution control
revenue bonds in July 1999; and $60 million aggregate principal amount of 6 3/8%
pollution control revenue bonds in August 1999.

     GEORGIA plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Issues" in the
Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital requirements for its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS "Financing Programs" in the
Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at September
30, 1999, approximately $49.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $1.3 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. The credit
arrangements provide liquidity support to GEORGIA's variable rate pollution
control bonds and its commercial paper program. At September 30, 1999, GEORGIA
had $119.5 million and $197.9 million outstanding in short-term notes payable to
banks and commercial paper, respectively. Management believes that the need for
working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

                               ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP
                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of September 30, 1999, and the related
condensed statements of income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 1999 and 1998 and cash flows for the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 1999 and 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1998
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 10, 1999, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1998, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

     Revenues. Revenues were higher for the third quarter due to a 6.9% increase
in total energy sales. The increase in total energy sales is primarily
attributed to growth in the number of customers served by GULF, as well as
warmer weather during the third quarter of 1999. The year-to-date 1999 decrease
reflects the recovery of lower fuel costs. Excluding recovery of fuel expense
and certain other expenses that do not affect income, retail revenues increased
$3.6 million for the quarter due to a 4.0% increase in retail energy sales,
which can primarily be attributed to an increase in the demand for energy
resulting from an increase in the number of residential customers and warmer
weather during the third quarter of 1999. Retail revenues decreased $1.9 million
year-to-date due, for the most part, to a decrease in revenues from industrial
customers during the first nine months of 1999 when compared to the same period
in 1998. Revenues from non-territorial wholesale energy sales decreased $1.2
million and $5.1 million for the third quarter and year-to-date 1999,
respectively, when compared to the same periods of 1998. The decreases in
non-territorial wholesale energy sales are attributed to decreased power
marketing activities.

     Revenues from affiliates and purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. Increases for this item in the third
quarter and year-to-date 1999 result from an increased demand for energy due to
warmer weather during the third quarter and an increase in the number of
customers when compared to the corresponding periods in 1998.

     Other operation expense. This item increased in the third quarter when
compared to the same period in 1998 due to an increase in other production
expenses. The year-to-date decrease is attributed primarily to lower
administrative and general expenses during the first half of 1999, as well as
prior year prepayments related to renegotiations of coal supply contracts being
fully amortized in 1998.

     Maintenance expense. The decrease for the current quarter is mainly due to
routine line maintenance performed during the third quarter of 1998. The
year-to-date 1999 increase reflects scheduled maintenance on steam plant
facilities.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. The third quarter and year-to-date
increases are primarily attributed to additions to plant during 1999 and
increased amortization expense related to the amortization of gains from the
sale of emission allowances when compared to the corresponding periods of 1998.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GULF is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings
Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein for
information relating to a complaint and notice of violation brought against
certain SOUTHERN subsidiaries at the request of the EPA.

     GULF's plans to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been implemented and are
included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related to GULF's
Year 2000 program are expected to be $5.2 million. From its inception through
September 30, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized as expense, amounted
to $4.5 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION -
"Future Earnings Potential" herein.

     In reference to the ongoing matters with the Florida PSC concerning GULF's
authorized return on equity (ROE) and the outstanding balances of certain
regulatory assets, GULF, the Office of the Public Counsel, the Coalition for
Equitable Rates, and the Florida Industrial Power Users Group jointly filed a
stipulation and settlement in October 1999 to effect an informal disposition and
complete and binding resolution of all matters before the Florida PSC related to
the investigation into earnings and reduction of the authorized ROE and the

petition for a full revenue requirements rate case (for additional information,
see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS "Future Earnings Potential"
and Item 1 - Business - "Regulation - State Commissions" of GULF in the Form
10-K). The stipulation calls for base rates to be reduced by $10 million
annually and provides for revenues above certain levels to be shared for
1999-2002. Customers will receive two-thirds of any revenue within the ranges
and GULF will retain one-third. The sharing plan will be in place until the
earlier of the day prior to the in-service date of GULF's Plant Smith Unit 3 or
December 31, 2002. GULF filed a request to prospectively reduce its authorized
ROE range from 11% - 13% to 10.5% - 12.5% in order to help ensure that the
Florida PSC would approve the stipulation. Both the stipulation and the rate of
return request were approved by the Florida PSC at the agenda conference on
October 5, 1999. The decisions of the Florida PSC have been reflected in final
orders.

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which was originally to be adopted by the year 2000.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral
of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which amends FASB Statement No.
133 to be effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 (January
1, 2001 for companies with calendar-year fiscal years). GULF has not yet
quantified the impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements;
however, the adoption could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (F) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first nine months of 1999
included the addition of approximately $48.4 million to utility plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

In August 1999, GULF issued $50 million of 7.05% senior notes due August 15,
2004. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of its outstanding short-term
indebtedness. GULF plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to
retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and "Other
Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of GULF's capital
requirements for its construction program, environmental compliance efforts and
maturing debt.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at September 30,
1999, approximately $5.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $41.5 million
of unused committed lines of credit with banks in addition to $61.9 million
liquidity support for variable rate pollution control bonds. Management believes
that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of
credit without maintaining large cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third
quarter and year-to-date 1999 was $27.3 million and $49.5 million, respectively,
compared to $28.3 million and $50.4 million for the corresponding periods of
1998. The slight decrease in earnings for the current quarter and year-to-date
resulted from higher operating expenses which offset increased operating
revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>


     Revenues. Third quarter and year-to-date increases are essentially due to
higher retail energy sales. Retail energy sales were up 5.1% for the quarter and
2.4% year-to-date. Retail sales to residential customers were down 4.8% and
5.6%, for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, due to milder temperatures
when compared to the same periods of 1998. Commercial and industrial sales were
up 2.5% and 14.2%, respectively, for the quarter and 3.6% and 6.4%,
respectively, year-to-date. Industrial energy sales were positively impacted by
increased production by several larger industrial customers, while commercial
energy sales were positively impacted by increased tourism and strong growth in
this sector. Retail revenues, excluding those revenues which represent the
recovery of fuel expense and certain other expenses and do not affect income,
increased $1.7 million for the current quarter and $2.3 million year-to-date.
Wholesale territorial revenues, excluding fuel revenues which do not affect
income, increased $3.0 million for the current quarter and $8.7 million
year-to-date.

     Revenues from affiliates. Revenues from sales to affiliated companies
within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increases in the current quarter
and year-to-date 1999 when compared to the corresponding periods in 1998
reflects the higher demand for energy.

     Other operation expense. These changes in this expense when compared to the
same periods in 1998 are primarily due to timing differences related to the
amortization of costs associated with the work force reduction plan during the
third quarter and higher distribution expenses year-to-date.

     Maintenance expense. This item is down for the third quarter and
year-to-date 1999 due to reduced maintenance expense and the
performance in the third quarter of 1998 of scheduled transmission and
distribution line maintenance.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment. Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in
rates under the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force
on electric rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking place. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, MISSISSIPPI is positioning
the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. MISSISSIPPI's 1999 ECO Plan filing was approved, as
filed, by the Mississippi PSC on March 18, 1999 and resulted in a slight
increase in customer prices. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein for
information relating to a complaint and notice of violation brought against
certain SOUTHERN subsidiaries at the request of the EPA.

     MISSISSIPPI's plans to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been implemented
and are included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related
to MISSISSIPPI's Year 2000 program are expected to be $5.6 million. From its
inception through September 30, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized as
expense, amounted to $5.1 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION - "Future Earnings Potential" herein.

         The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which was to be adopted by the year 2000.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral
of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133 - an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 133, which delayed adoption until the year 2001. MISSISSIPPI has not yet
quantified the impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements;
however, the adoption could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (F) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first nine months
of 1999 included the addition of approximately $52.1 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
for further details.

Financing Activities

MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

In April 1999, MISSISSIPPI and Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership
("Escatawpa"), entered into a lease agreement whereby MISSISSIPPI will design
and construct, as agent for Escatawpa, a 1,080 megawatt natural gas combined
cycle facility. It is expected that the project will cost approximately $406
million, and upon completion of the facility, MISSISSIPPI will lease the
facility from Escatawpa for an initial term of approximately 10 years. For
additional information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS - "Capital Requirements for Construction" of MISSISSIPPI and Notes
3 and 4 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of
MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its construction program, environmental
compliance efforts, sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION




Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at
September 30, 1999, approximately $161 thousand of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $74.5 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks
(including $10.8 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made
only to fund purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control
bonds). At September 30, 1999, MISSISSIPPI had short-term notes payable
outstanding of $43.2 million. Management believes that the need for working
capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining
large cash balances.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter
and year-to-date 1999 was $13.7 million and $20.2 million, respectively, as
compared to $12.5 million and $22.8 million for the corresponding periods of
1998. The third quarter earnings increase is attributed to higher operating
revenues. The year-to-date earnings decrease is mainly due to lower operating
revenues primarily reflecting the Georgia PSC's accounting order, lower
industrial retail energy sales and higher operation expenses. For additional
information, see Note (M) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements"
herein for details regarding the accounting order.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

N/M - Not meaningful

     Revenues. The third quarter 1999 revenues were up primarily due to
increased retail energy sales to residential and commercial customers. Energy
sales to those customers during the quarter rose by 5.1% and 9.6%, respectively,
due mainly to hotter temperatures recorded in August 1999. Year-to-date 1999
revenues were down primarily due to the impact of the Georgia PSC's accounting
order and lower industrial energy sales. Industrial energy sales were down by
18.1% and 19.8% for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, due to reduced
demand from one industrial customer and the shut-down of another industrial
customer's facilities. In the third quarter and year-to-date 1999, the impacts
on SAVANNAH's revenues from this shut-down were $0.3 million and $0.7 million,
respectively. For additional information, see "Future Earnings Potential"
herein.

     Revenues from affiliates. Revenues from sales to affiliated companies
within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

      Purchased power from non-affiliates. The third quarter and year-to-date
increases are primarily due to higher demand for energy and increased costs for
purchased power in the third quarter of 1999.

     Other operation expense. The increases for the third quarter and
year-to-date 1999 reflect additional storm damage reserve accruals and expenses
associated with environmental clean-up activities at Plant Kraft.

     Other interest charges. The increases in this item for the third quarter
and year-to-date 1999 are primarily related to a potential tax audit settlement.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     In 1998, the Georgia PSC approved a four-year accounting order for
SAVANNAH. Reference is made to Note (M) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     In mid-1998, one of SAVANNAH's largest industrial customers added an
additional steam turbine unit. The impact of this on SAVANNAH's revenues had
been planned for, and the customer is under contract for a minimum of 5
megawatts per year. In October 1998, another of SAVANNAH's largest customers
closed its Savannah operations. Base revenues from this customer had averaged $2
million annually. Under the terms of its contract with SAVANNAH, this customer
is obligated to pay $1 million annually through 2001.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SAVANNAH is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein for
information relating to a complaint and notice of violation brought against
certain SOUTHERN subsidiaries at the request of the EPA.

     SAVANNAH's plans to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been implemented and
are included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related to
SAVANNAH's Year 2000 program are expected to be $1.3 million. From its inception
through September 30, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized as expense,
amounted to $1.1 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION - "Future Earnings Potential" herein.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which was originally to be adopted by the year 2000.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral
of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which amends FASB Statement No.
133 to be effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 (January
1, 2001 for companies with calendar-year fiscal years). SAVANNAH has not yet
quantified the impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements;
however, the adoption could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (M) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first nine months of
1999 included the addition of approximately $21.5 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations and credit arrangements with banks. See SAVANNAH's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

In June 1999, SAVANNAH purchased on the open market all $15 million outstanding
of its 7 7/8% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 1, 2025. This purchase was
financed with short-term debt. SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent
possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and replace these obligations
with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at September
30, 1999, approximately $5 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $34.4 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. At
September 30, 1999, SAVANNAH had $26.1 million outstanding of notes payable to
banks. Since SAVANNAH has no major generating plants under construction,
management believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by
utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)   The condensed financial statements of the registrants included herein
      have been prepared by each registrant, without audit, pursuant to the
      rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of each registrant's
      management, the information regarding such registrant furnished herein
      reflects all adjustments necessary to present fairly the results for the
      periods ended September 30, 1999 and 1998. Certain information and
      footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
      accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
      condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although each
      registrant believes that the disclosures regarding such registrant are
      adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  It is
      suggested that these condensed financial statements of each registrant be
      read in conjunction with the financial statements of such registrant and
      the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K.  Certain prior period amounts
      have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. Due to
      seasonal variations in the demand for energy, operating results for the
      periods presented do not necessarily indicate operating results for the
      entire year.

      The condensed financial statements of ALABAMA and GEORGIA included herein
      have been reviewed by ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's independent public
      accountants as set forth in their reports included herein as Exhibit 1 to
      ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)   SOUTHERN's operating affiliates are subject to the provisions of FASB
      Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
      Regulation. In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no
      longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
      off related unrecoverable regulatory assets and liabilities, and determine
      if any other assets have been impaired. For additional information, see
      Note 1 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the
      Form 10-K.

(C)   The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
      practices of the electric utility industry--including
      SOUTHERN's--regarding the recognition, measurement and classification of
      decommissioning costs for nuclear generating facilities in the financial
      statements. In response to these questions, the FASB has decided to review
      the accounting for obligations related to the retirement of long-lived
      assets, including nuclear decommissioning. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
      SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial
      statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA under "Depreciation and
      Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)   SOUTHERN engages in price risk management activities. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Derivative Financial Instruments"
      and Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for a discussion of these activities. Activities for non-trading
      purposes consist of transactions that are employed to mitigate SOUTHERN's
      risk related to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate
      fluctuations. At September 30, 1999, the status of outstanding non-trading
      related derivative contracts was as follows:

      In January 1998, Southern Energy and Vastar Resources, Inc. combined their
      energy trading and marketing activities to form a joint venture. Southern
      Energy's investment in the joint venture is accounted for under the equity
      method of accounting. SOUTHERN and Vastar have made guarantees to certain
      counterparties regarding performance of contractual commitments by the
      joint venture. At September 30, 1999, outstanding guarantees related to
      the estimated fair value of net contractual commitments were approximately
      $166 million. Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
      "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 5 to the
      financial statements of SOUTHERN under the captions "Financial Instruments
      for Trading Activities" and "Energy Trading and Marketing Commitments",
      respectively, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(E)   SOUTHERN's principal business segment -- or its traditional business -- is
      the five regulated electric utility operating companies that provide
      electric service in four southeastern states. The other reportable
      business segment is non-traditional energy services provided by Southern
      Energy, which develops and manages electricity and other energy-related
      projects both in the United States and abroad. Intersegment revenues are
      not material. Financial data for business segments for the periods covered
      in the Form 10-Q are as follows:

     (Note) The all other category includes parent SOUTHERN, which does not
     allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category
     includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate
     disclosure. These segments include a wireless communication company and a
     developmental company for energy products and services. Non-traditional
     services exclude interest expense to parent SOUTHERN.

(F)  Reference  is made to Notes 3 and 7 to each of the  registrant's  financial
     statements,  except SAVANNAH'S, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a discussion
     of the FERC  orders in  proceedings  regarding  the  reasonableness  of the
     return on common  equity  on  certain  of the  Southern  electric  system's
     wholesale  rate  schedules  and contracts and a discussion of the long-term
     power sales agreements. On October 14, 1999, the FERC approved a settlement
     agreement  relating to the  proceedings  pending at the FERC which provides
     for an  equity  return  of 11% under the  formula  rates.  These  rates are
     effective as of January 5, 1999 for three unit power sales  contracts,  and
     as of July 1, 1999 for the other contracts.  Since the rates were placed in
     effect on July 1, 1999 under an interim  order of the FERC,  a total refund
     of  approximately  $4 million ($2.9  million for ALABAMA,  $0.7 million for
     GEORGIA and $0.4 million for GULF) is required to reflect the change in the
     equity return from 12.5% to 11% under the three unit power sales  contracts
     for the period  January 5, 1999 through June 30, 1999. A liability  for the
     refund is reflected in the September 30, 1999 balance sheet of the affected
     registrants.

(G)  During the first nine months of 1999, statutory business trusts, formed by
     ALABAMA and GEORGIA of which such companies own all the common securities,
     issued mandatorily redeemable preferred securities as follows: (in
     thousands)

</TABLE>

     Substantially all the assets of each trust are junior subordinated notes
     issued by the related company in the respective approximate principal
     amounts set forth above. ALABAMA and GEORGIA consider that the mechanisms
     and obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its
     benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by
     it of the respective trusts' payment obligations with respect to the
     preferred securities.

(H)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
     ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to retail
     rate adjustment procedures.

(I)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
     ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to a judgment
     against ALABAMA arising from discharges into Lake Martin. The trial court
     has denied the defendants' motion for a new trial and for remittitur, and
     ALABAMA has appealed to the Supreme Court of Alabama.

(J)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
     ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to a class
     action charging ALABAMA with fraud and non-compliance with regulatory
     statutes relating to the offer, sale and financing of "extended service
     contracts" in connection with the sale of electric appliances. This action
     has been settled for an insignificant amount, and the case has been
     dismissed.

(K)  Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information  concerning a three-year
     rate order approved by the Georgia PSC effective January 1, 1999. The order
     decreased annual retail rates by $262 million effective January 1, 1999 and
     by an additional $24 million  effective  January 1, 2000. The order further
     provides for $85 million each year, plus up to $50 million  annually of any
     earnings in excess of a 12.5%  retail  return on common  equity  during the
     second  and third  years,  to be  applied to  accelerated  amortization  or
     depreciation of assets.  Two-thirds of any additional earnings in excess of
     the 12.5%  return  will be applied  to rate  reductions  and the  remaining
     one-third  retained  by  GEORGIA.  Pursuant  to  this  provision,   GEORGIA
     recognized, as a reduction to revenue, $77 million in the third quarter for
     potential  rate refunds  related to  two-thirds  of  estimated  earnings in
     excess of 12.5% return.

     Under a previous three-year accounting order ending December 1998,
     GEORGIA's earnings were evaluated against a retail return on common equity
     range of 10% to 12.5%. Earnings in excess of 12.5% were used to accelerate
     the depreciation of electric plant. For earnings in excess of the 12.5%
     retail return, GEORGIA recorded charges of $113.8 million and $281.3
     million, respectively, during the third quarter and year-to-date 1998.

(L)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
     designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
     Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
     environmental contingencies.

(M)  In 1998, the Georgia PSC approved a new accounting order for SAVANNAH.
     Under this order, SAVANNAH will reduce electric rates to its small
     business customers, expense additional storm damage accruals and accrue
     additional depreciation on generating assets. For additional information
     concerning the four-year accounting order approved by the Georgia PSC in
     June 1998, reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of
     SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)



(N)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item
     8 and to  Legal  Proceedings  in Item 3 of the Form  10-K  for  information
     relating to petitions for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  relief which were filed in
     the U. S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Alabama.  Effective
     with the bankruptcy  filing in January 1999, Mobile Energy is accounted for
     under the equity method,  rather than being  consolidated  as before.  As a
     result of recent settlement discussions with Kimberly-Clark Corporation and
     the  bondholders,  Southern  Energy  reevaluated  possible  outcomes of the
     negotiations and recorded an after-tax write down of $69 million  primarily
     representing  SOUTHERN's  equity  investment in Mobile Energy. At September
     30,  1999,  Mobile  Energy had total assets of $380 million and senior debt
     outstanding of $193 million of first mortgage bonds and $73 million related
     to tax-exempt  bonds.  In  connection  with the bond  financings,  SOUTHERN
     provided  certain limited  guarantees,  in lieu of funding debt service and
     maintenance  reserve accounts with cash. As of September 30, 1999, under an
     agreement with the bondholders,  SOUTHERN had paid $38,272,000  pursuant to
     the  guarantees.  SOUTHERN  continues  to have  guarantees  outstanding  of
     certain potential environmental and other obligations of Mobile Energy that
     represent a maximum  contingent  liability of $21 million at September  30,
     1999. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

(O)  In 1998, SOUTHERN's Board of Directors authorized SOUTHERN to make open
     market purchases of its common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed
     $300 million through March 31, 1999. The purpose of the program was to
     provide shares of common stock for the purchase requirements of SOUTHERN's
     various stockholder, employee and outside director stock purchase plans.
     Under the program, 4.4 million shares had been repurchased and 2.4 million
     shares were reissued.

     Also, in April 1999, SOUTHERN's board approved the repurchase of up to 50
     million shares of SOUTHERN's common stock over the next two years through
     open market or privately negotiated transactions. The program does not
     establish a target stock price or timetable for specific repurchases.
     Under this program, 25,821,200 shares have been repurchased through
     November 9, 1999, with funding provided from SOUTHERN's commercial paper
     program.

PART II       -  OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1.          Legal Proceedings.


        (1)       On November 3, 1999, the United States of America, acting at
                  the request of the EPA, brought a civil action in the U. S.
                  District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against
                  ALABAMA, GEORGIA and SCS. The complaint alleges violations of
                  the prevention of significant deterioration and new source
                  review provisions of the Clean Air Act with respect to
                  coal-fired generating facilities at ALABAMA's Barry, Gorgas
                  and Miller plants and GEORGIA's Bowen and Scherer plants and
                  requests civil penalties and injunctive relief, including an
                  order requiring the installation of the best available control
                  technology at the affected units.

                  The EPA concurrently issued a notice of violation to the
                  operating companies and SCS relating to ALABAMA's Barry,
                  Gaston, Gorgas, Greene County and Miller plants, GEORGIA's
                  Bowen and Scherer plants, GULF's Crist plant, MISSISSIPPI's
                  Watson plant and SAVANNAH's Kraft plant.

                  The complaint and notice of violation are similar to
                  those brought against and issued to several other electric
                  utilities. These complaints and notices of
                  violation allege that the utilities had failed
                  to secure necessary permits or install additional
                  pollution equipment when performing maintenance and
                  construction at coal burning plants constructed or under
                  construction prior to 1978. SOUTHERN believes that it
                  complied with applicable laws and the EPA's regulations and
                  interpretations in effect at the time the work in question
                  took place.

                  Although the outcome of this matter cannot presently be
                  determined, a result adverse to SOUTHERN could require the
                  expenditure of substantial additional capital at its existing
                  plants and possibly require payment of substantial penalties.


           (2)    Reference is made to the Notes to the Condensed Financial
                  Statements herein for information regarding certain legal and
                  administrative proceedings in which SOUTHERN and its reporting
                  subsidiaries are involved.
