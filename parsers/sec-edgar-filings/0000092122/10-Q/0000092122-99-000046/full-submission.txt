           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

     This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements
in addition to historical information. The registrants caution that there are
various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those indicated in the forward-looking statements; accordingly, there can
be no assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These factors
include legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and
restructuring of the electric utility industry; the extent and timing of the
entry of additional competition in the markets of SOUTHERN's subsidiaries;
challenges related to Year 2000 readiness; potential business strategies,
including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or internal restructuring, that
may be pursued by the registrants; state and federal rate regulation in the
United States; changes in or application of environmental and other laws and
regulations to which SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries are subject; political, legal
and economic conditions and developments in the United States and in foreign
countries in which the subsidiaries operate; financial market conditions and the
results of financing efforts; changes in commodity prices and interest rates;
weather and other natural phenomena; the performance of projects undertaken by
the non-traditional business and the success of efforts to invest in and develop
new opportunities; and other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in other
reports (including Form 10-K) filed from time to time by the registrants with

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   FIRST QUARTER 1999 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1998

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SOUTHERN's  consolidated  net income for the first quarter of 1999 was $224
million  ($0.32 per share)  compared to $242  million  ($0.35 per share) for the
corresponding  period of 1998.  Earnings for the traditional  business were down
for this quarter due primarily to the timing of GEORGIA's  earnings  under a new
retail rate order,  mild weather and maintenance  expenses.  Under GEORGIA's new
order,  fixed rate reductions and accelerated  amortization are being recognized
ratably throughout 1999. During 1998, variable accelerated depreciation recorded
under the previous  accounting order was primarily  recognized during the higher
revenue summer months. Earnings for the non-traditional  business rose primarily
due to the  improved  earnings  from  CEPA  as a  result  of  gains  related  to
settlement  of claims on  construction  of a power plant  project  and  improved
financial performance.

     SOUTHERN's traditional core business is primarily represented by its five
domestic electric utility operating companies, which provide electric service in
four Southeastern states. Another significant portion of SOUTHERN's business is
its non-traditional business primarily represented by Southern Energy, which
owns and manages international and domestic businesses for SOUTHERN. Businesses
acquired by Southern Energy have been included in the consolidated statements of
income since the date of acquisition. Certain changes in operating revenues and
expenses from the prior period result from such acquisitions. 

Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the 
following:

                 THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Operating revenues. Operating revenues for the traditional core business
for the first quarter of 1999 decreased $73 million or 3.7% compared to the same
period of 1998. Despite a slight increase of 1.4% in retail energy sales,
traditional core business revenues decreased for this first quarter of 1999 due
primarily to a retail rate reduction ordered by the Georgia PSC which affected
GEORGIA's revenues. Retail revenues, excluding fuel and any demand-side program
revenues which generally do not affect income, decreased $46 million for the
first quarter of 1999. Operating revenues for Southern Energy increased
approximately $13 million or 2.6% during the first quarter of 1999 when compared
to the corresponding period in 1998. This increase in Southern Energy's
operating revenues is attributed to Southern Energy's acquisition of
Commonwealth Electric's generating business ("New England acquisition") in
December 1998 which was partially offset by the deconsolidation of Mobile
Energy. Effective with the bankruptcy filing in January 1999, Mobile Energy is
accounted for under the equity method, rather than being consolidated as before.
See Note (O) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for
further information regarding Mobile Energy. Reference is also made to Item 1 -
BUSINESS - "Non-Traditional Business" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K

     Fuel expense. During the first quarter of 1999, $29 million of the increase
in fuel expenses is related to Southern Energy's New England acquisition in
December 1998 and the remainder of the increase resulted primarily from
increased generation.

     Purchased power expense. Purchased power expenses for the traditional core
business dropped approximately $27 million or 36.3% for the first quarter of
1999. The decrease in these expenses for the traditional core business is mainly
attributed to a decrease in energy purchases related to power marketing
activities during this first quarter of 1999 when compared to the same period in
1998.

     Other operation expense. The first quarter of 1999 increase is mainly
attributed to Southern Energy, which had a $17 million or 26% increase
principally due to Southern Energy's increased business development activities
and the New England acquisition.

     Maintenance expense. The first quarter increase is primarily attributed to
the traditional business. Maintenance expenses in the traditional business
increased approximately $21 million or 12% due to maintenance being performed
during this quarter on generating facilities and transmission and distribution
lines.

     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. The major increase in
this item reflects the $54 million settlement of Southern Energy's claims
against a contractor relating to the Shajiao C construction project in China and
the improvement in profitability of the Shajiao C operations. The amount of the
settlement of contractor claims is partially offset by other related expenses
and income taxes included in other income accounts.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment, with non-traditional business becoming more significant. For
information relating to non-traditional business activities, see Item 1 -
BUSINESS - "Non-Traditional Business" in the Form 10-K.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     On April 15, 1999, SOUTHERN through its subsidiary Southern Energy,
completed the purchase of 3,065 megawatts of generating assets in California
from Pacific Gas & Electric for approximately $801 million.

     For information relating to Year 2000 readiness, see "YEAR 2000 READINESS"
below.

     The FASB has issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by the year 2000. This
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. SOUTHERN has not yet quantified the
impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements; however, the
adoption could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) through (F), (H) through (M), (O) and (P)
in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of
various contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings
potential. Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings"
herein.

effect, that all years began with "19." This practice was widely adopted and
hard-coded into computer chips and processors found in some equipment. This
approach, intended to save processing time and storage space, was used until the
mid-1990s. Unless corrected before the Year 2000, affected software systems and
devices containing a chip or microprocessor with date and time functions could
incorrectly process dates or the systems may cease to function.

     SOUTHERN depends on complex computer systems for many aspects of its
operations, which include generation, transmission, and distribution of
electricity, as well as other business support activities. SOUTHERN's goal is to
have critical devices or software that are required to maintain operations to be
Year 2000 ready by June 1999. Year 2000 ready means that a system or application
is determined suitable for continued use through the Year 2000 and beyond.
Critical systems include, but are not limited to, reactor control systems, safe
shutdown systems, turbine generator systems, control center computer systems,
customer service systems, energy management systems, and telephone switches and
equipment.


Year 2000 Program and Status

SOUTHERN's executive management recognizes the seriousness of the Year 2000
challenge and has dedicated what it believes to be adequate resources to address
the issue. The Millennium Project is a team of employees, IBM consultants, and
other contractors whose progress is reviewed on a monthly basis by a steering
committee of SOUTHERN executives.

     SOUTHERN's traditional business refers to the integrated utility services
within Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. For this traditional
business, the work was divided into two phases. Phase I began in 1996 and
consisted of identifying and assessing corporate assets related to software
systems and devices that contain a computer chip or clock. The first phase was
completed in June 1997. Phase 2 consists of testing and remediating high
priority systems and devices. Also, contingency planning is included in this
phase. Completion of Phase 2 is targeted for June 1999. The Millennium Project
will continue to monitor the affected computer systems, devices, and
applications into the Year 2000.

     For the non-traditional business, Southern Energy has adopted a three-phase
plan to address the Year 2000 challenge at its North American and international
business units. The first phase consists of awareness and planning, inventory
and assessment, and it includes the identification of potentially impacted
systems and an assessment of their individual Year 2000 readiness. The second
phase, which includes testing, remediation, and validation, consists of repair
or replacement of impacted equipment, and verification that those repairs have
addressed the issue. Contingency planning is the third phase, and it includes
backup plans for unexpected events with critical systems, staffing plans for
critical date rollovers, and plans to address external dependencies. Business
units are using Year 2000 readiness information received from suppliers,
including fuel suppliers, to determine if inventory adjustments are needed for
the transition period.

     The following three tables summarize the status of progress of Southern
Energy's North American and international business units as of March 31, 1999.

     In a number of the international business units, Southern Energy is neither
the majority owner nor the managing concern. In these circumstances, Southern
Energy is providing technical assistance but does not control the schedule or
progress.

Year 2000 Costs

For the traditional business, current projected total costs for Year 2000
readiness are approximately $91 million, which includes $6 million of cost
billed to non-affiliated companies. These costs include labor necessary to
identify, test, and renovate affected devices and systems. From its inception
through March 31, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized primarily as
expense, amounted to $70 million based on SOUTHERN's ownership interest. In
addition to the traditional business costs, current projections for Year 2000
program costs are approximately $20 million for the non-traditional business -
based on SOUTHERN's ownership interest of which $11 million has been spent
through March 31, 1999.

Year 2000 Risks

SOUTHERN is implementing a detailed process to minimize the possibility of
service interruptions related to the Year 2000. The company believes, based on
current tests, the system of the traditional business can provide customers with
electricity. These tests increase confidence, but do not guarantee error-free
operations. The company is taking what it believes to be prudent steps to
prepare for the Year 2000, and it expects any interruptions in service that may
occur within the traditional business service territory to be isolated and short
in duration.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     SOUTHERN expects the risks associated with Year 2000 to be no more severe
than the scenarios that its electric system is routinely prepared to handle. The
most likely worst case scenario consists of the service loss of one of the
largest generating units and/or the service loss of any single bulk transmission
element in its traditional business service territory. There is a smaller risk
of sporadic and temporary fluctuations of power levels that would be aggravated
in the event of rapid and unscheduled changes to load patterns that resulted
from the activity of third parties. SOUTHERN has followed a proven methodology
for identifying and assessing software and devices containing potential Year
2000 challenges. Remediation and testing of those devices are in progress.
SOUTHERN has prepared contingency plans as appropriate and is participating in
North American Electric Reliability Council-coordinated national drills during
1999.

     SOUTHERN is currently reviewing the Year 2000 readiness of material third
parties that provide goods and services crucial to SOUTHERN's operations. Among
such critical third parties are fuel, transportation, telecommunications, water,
chemical, and other suppliers. There is some risk associated with
representations by third parties regarding their readiness and completion of
their own Year 2000 related work. Contingency plans based on the assessment of
each third party's ability to continue supplying critical goods and services to
SOUTHERN have been developed and are being reviewed.

     There is a potential for some earnings erosion caused by reduced electrical
demand by customers because of their own Year 2000 challenges. The risk
associated with the progress of some operations outside the United States is a
function of the local regulatory environment and the priorities of the entities
with management control. Year 2000 challenges are included in the list of due
diligence activities associated with acquisitions; there is some risk associated
with the subsequent validation of any given seller's representations.

Contingency Plans

Because of experience with hurricanes and other storms, the traditional business
is skilled at developing and using contingency plans in unusual circumstances.
As part of Year 2000 business continuity and contingency planning, SOUTHERN is
drawing on that experience to make risk assessments and is developing additional
plans to deal specifically with situations that could arise relative to Year
2000 challenges. SOUTHERN is identifying critical operational locations, and
scheduling key employees to be on duty at those locations during the Year 2000
transition. SOUTHERN is participating in two North American Electric Reliability
Council-coordinated national drills during 1999, and is conducting additional
tests to validate its contingency plans. Because of the level of detail of the
contingency planning process, management feels that the contingency plans will
keep any service interruptions that may occur within the traditional business
service territory isolated and short in duration.

     Contingency planning efforts for the non-traditional business are generally
in the initial phase.

     The material in this section constitutes forward-looking statements made
pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There can be
no assurance that the actual results of SOUTHERN, its suppliers, or other third
party dependencies will not materially differ from expectations.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first three months of
1999 included $505 million used for gross property additions to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were from
operations and sales of securities. See SOUTHERN's Condensed Statements of Cash
Flows for further details.

     Reference is made to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive
Income enclosed herein for information relating to other comprehensive income
for the quarter ended March 31, 1999. In the quarter, Southern Energy recognized
$107 million of after-tax foreign exchange translation losses in other
comprehensive income which were principally related to normal shifts in exchange
rates between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling and the Deutschemark, and
to the 50% devaluation of the Brazilian Real.

Financing Activities

During the first three months of 1999, retirements and redemptions of the
operating companies' first mortgage bonds and preferred stock totaled $504
million and $86 million, respectively. In February 1999, Alabama Power Capital
Trust III (the "Trust"), a statutory business trust established for the purpose
of holding ALABAMA's junior subordinated notes and issuing trust preferred
securities and common securities, sold $50 million of its capital auction
preferred securities which are guaranteed by ALABAMA. Also, in February 1999,
Georgia Power Capital Trust IV, a statutory business trust established for the
purpose of holding GEORGIA's junior subordinated notes and issuing trust
preferred securities and common securities, sold $200 million of its 6.85% trust
preferred securities, which are guaranteed by GEORGIA. Additionally, in March
1999, GEORGIA issued $100 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due March 31, 2039. The
proceeds from this issuance were used to repay a portion of GEORGIA's
outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     During the first three months of 1999, SOUTHERN raised $24 million from the
issuance of 883 thousand shares of common stock under SOUTHERN's various stock
plans. See Note (P) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for discussion of programs to repurchase SOUTHERN's common stock. The market
price of SOUTHERN's common stock at March 31, 1999 was $23.3125 per share and
the book value was $13.89 per share, representing a market-to-book ratio of
168%, compared to $29.0625, $14.04 and 207%, respectively, at the end of 1998.
The dividend for the first quarter of 1999 was $0.335 per share.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements for Construction", "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern electric
system's capital requirements for its construction program, sinking fund
requirements and maturing debt, and environmental compliance efforts.
Approximately $1.1 billion will be required by March 31, 2000, for present
sinking fund requirements, redemption of preferred

stock and redemptions and maturities of long-term debt. Also, the operating
companies plan to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 1999, as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
March 31, 1999, approximately $554 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $4.6 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks (including
$1,368 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made only to
fund purchase obligations of the operating companies relating to variable rate
pollution control bonds). At March 31, 1999, the system companies had
outstanding approximately $950 million of short-term notes payable and $1,413
million of commercial paper. Management believes that the need for working
capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining
large cash balances.

     See Note (D) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for discussion of financial derivative contracts entered into by SOUTHERN.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1999 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1998


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter of
1999 was $63.1 million compared to $66.0 million for the corresponding period of
1998. Earnings for this quarter decreased $2.9 million or 4.5% when compared to
the same period in 1998 due primarily to an increase in operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                        First Quarter
                                            -----------------------------------
                                               (in thousands)         %
Revenues....................................     $(7,072)            (1.0)
Revenues from affiliates....................       4,891             11.6
Purchased power from non-affiliates ........      (9,955)           (56.8)
Purchased power from affiliates.............       8,795             47.2
Maintenance expense.........................       7,241             11.4
Interest income.............................      (4,224)           (30.9)
Other interest charges......................      (5,788)           (42.5)


     Revenues. Revenues for the first quarter of 1999 were down from the same
period in 1998 due primarily to a 12.7% decrease in non-territorial energy sales
resulting in a $12.9 million decrease in non-territorial revenues which was
partially offset by a 2.3% increase in territorial energy sales or $8.9 million
increase in territorial revenues. Non-territorial energy sales were down due to
a decrease in unit power sales and a decrease in sales for resale outside
ALABAMA's service area. Territorial revenues increased primarily due to a 1.7%
increase in retail energy sales. Retail revenues, excluding those revenues which
represent the recovery of fuel expense and certain other expenses and do not
affect income, increased $1 million for the current quarter.

                              ALABAMA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand, the
availability, and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. These expenses dropped in the current
quarter of 1999 when compared to the same period of 1998 due primarily to
increased purchases in 1998 related to power marketing activities, a majority of
which were resold to non-affiliated third parties. These transactions had no
significant effect on net income.

     Maintenance expense. These costs increased for the first quarter primarily
due to maintenance on steam and nuclear plants and transmission and distribution
lines.

     Interest income. This item was lower for the first quarter of 1999 when
compared to the first quarter in 1998 due to a decrease in recognized gains on
investments held by the nuclear decommissioning trust. The decrease in interest
income related to the nuclear decommissioning trust was offset by a concurrent
recognition of other interest charges in accordance with FERC requirements.

     Other interest charges. The change in these charges for the current quarter
when compared to the same period in 1998 is attributed to a decrease in interest
charges related to the nuclear decommissioning trust. The decrease was offset by
a concurrent recognition of interest income in accordance with FERC
requirements.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in
the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     ALABAMA's plans to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been implemented and
are included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related to
ALABAMA's Year 2000 program, including ALABAMA's share of costs of Southern
Nuclear Operating Company, are expected to be $29.6 million. From its inception
through March 31, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized primarily as
expense, amounted to $17.5 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION - "Future Earnings Potential" herein.

     The FASB has issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by the year 2000. This
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. ALABAMA has not yet quantified the impact
of adopting this statement on its financial statements; however, the adoption
could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (F) through (J) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first three months of
1999 included the addition of approximately $142.1 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Financing Activities

During the first three months of 1999, redemptions of first mortgage bonds and
preferred stock by ALABAMA totaled $300 million and $50 million, respectively.
In February 1999, Alabama Power Capital Trust III (the "Trust"), a statutory
business trust established for the purpose of holding ALABAMA's junior
subordinated notes and issuing trust preferred securities and common securities,
sold $50 million of its capital auction preferred securities which are
guaranteed by ALABAMA. The Trust will invest the proceeds in Series C junior
subordinated notes. The net proceeds received by ALABAMA will be used to repay a
portion of ALABAMA's outstanding short-term indebtedness. See Note (G) in the "
Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information.

     ALABAMA will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and
replace these securities with lower-cost capital as market conditions permit.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION




Capital Requirements

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
ALABAMA under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital
requirements for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental
compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at March 31,
1999, approximately $21.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and had unused
committed lines of credit of approximately $786 million (including $315 million
of such lines under which borrowings may be made only to fund purchase
obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds) with regulatory
authority for up to $750 million of short-term borrowings. Reference is made to
"Financing Activities" above for information related to the planned redemptions
of certain First Mortgage Bonds. At March 31, 1999, ALABAMA had outstanding
$322.7 million of commercial paper.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of March 31, 1999, and the related condensed statements of income for
the three-month periods ended March 31, 1999 and 1998 and cash flows for the
three-month periods ended March 31, 1999 and 1998. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1998
(not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 10, 1999, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1998 is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1999 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1998


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter of
1999 was $91.6 million compared to $105.9 million for the corresponding period
in 1998. Earnings decreased by $14.3 million or 13.5% for this first quarter due
primarily to the timing of earnings under a new retail rate order effective
January 1999. Under the new order, fixed rate reductions and accelerated
amortization are being recognized ratably throughout 1999. During 1998, variable
accelerated depreciation recorded under the previous accounting order was
primarily recognized during the higher revenue summer months. See Note (K) in
the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further details
regarding the retail rate order.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

     Revenues. Revenues within the service area decreased by $40.9 million for
the first quarter when compared to the corresponding period in 1998. Retail
revenues, excluding fuel revenues which generally do not affect income,
decreased $47.4 million for the first quarter of 1999 when compared to the same
period in 1998 as a direct result of retail rate reductions ordered by the
Georgia PSC. Energy sales within the service area rose slightly due primarily to
a 1.7% increase in retail energy sales.

     Wholesale revenues within the service area decreased $9.8 million during
the first quarter primarily as a result of a scheduled reduction in capacity
revenues under a power supply agreement with OPC and a decrease in energy sales.
Wholesale revenues outside the service area decreased by $13.9 million for the
first quarter of 1999 when compared to the same period in 1998 primarily due to
a decrease in energy sales.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to operating affiliates within SOUTHERN, as well as purchases of energy,
will vary from period to period depending on demand and the availability and
cost of generating resources at each company. These transactions do not have a
significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The decrease for this first quarter of
1999 when compared to the same period in 1998 was mainly due to higher demand in
1998 for energy and higher energy purchases in 1998 related to power marketing
activities, a majority of which were resold to non-affiliated third parties.
These transactions had no significant effect on net income.

     Maintenance expense. These costs for the first quarter 1999 increased
primarily due to scheduled outages at generating facilities.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. The decrease in the first quarter as
compared to the same period in 1998 is primarily due to the decrease of
accelerated depreciation and amortization charges of $12.8 million pursuant to
the new retail rate order and the completion in 1998 of the amortization of
deferred Plant Vogtle costs. See Note (K) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for details regarding the retail rate order.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary companies.
Distributions for the first quarter 1999 increased primarily due to the issuance
of additional mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in February 1999.

     Dividends on preferred stock. Dividends for the current quarter decreased
as a result of the redemption during 1998 of adjustable rate preferred stock.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in
the Form 10-K.

     Effective January 1, 1999, GEORGIA began operating under a new three-year
retail rate order. Under the order, GEORGIA's earnings are evaluated against a
retail return on common equity range of 10% to 12.5%. In compliance with the
order, retail rates were decreased by $262 million on an annual basis effective
January 1, 1999. Reference is made to Note (K) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     In September 1998, OPC decreased its purchases of capacity under a power
supply agreement by 250 megawatts, resulting in a $16 million reduction in 1999
revenues. Under the amended 1995 Integrated Resource Plan approved by the
Georgia PSC in March 1997, the resources associated with the decreased purchases
in 1998 will be used to meet the needs of GEORGIA's retail customers through
2004. As a result of additional reduction notices given by OPC under its
agreement with GEORGIA, GEORGIA's capacity revenues received from OPC were
estimated to decrease by an additional $7 million in 1999, $18 million in 2000
and $4 million in 2001. Effective April 1, 1999, GEORGIA and OPC entered into a
new agreement which will delay, in part, planned purchase reductions by OPC. The
new agreement has been filed with the FERC under SOUTHERN's market-based rate
authority. Based on the above, GEORGIA's capacity revenues received from OPC are
now estimated to decrease by approximately $6 million in 1999, $15 million in
2000 and $7 million in 2001.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings. For additional information, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the
Form 10-K.

     GEORGIA's plans to achieve Year 2000 compliance have been implemented and
are included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related to
GEORGIA's Year 2000 program, including GEORGIA's share of costs of Southern
Nuclear Operating Company, are expected to be approximately $38 million. From
its inception through March 31, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized as
expense, amounted to $32 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION - "Future Earnings Potential" herein.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (F), (G), (K) through (M) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first three months
of 1999 was the addition of approximately $163 million to gross plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations. See GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION




Financing Activities

During the first three months of 1999, redemptions of first mortgage bonds and
preferred stock by GEORGIA totaled $204 million and $35.7 million, respectively.
In February 1999, Georgia Power Capital Trust IV, a statutory business trust
established for the purpose of holding GEORGIA's junior subordinated notes and
issuing trust preferred securities and common securities, sold $200 million of
its 6.85% trust preferred securities, which are guaranteed by GEORGIA. (See Note
(G) in the " Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Financing Activities" of GEORGIA in the
Form 10-K for further details.) In March 1999, GEORGIA issued $100 million of 6
5/8% senior notes due March 31, 2039. The proceeds from this issuance were used
to repay a portion of GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     GEORGIA plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Issues" in the
Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital requirements for its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS "Financing Programs" in the
Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at March 31,
1999, approximately $17.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$1.3 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. Of the $1.3 billion, $980
million provides liquidity support to GEORGIA's variable rate pollution control
bonds. At March 31, 1999, GEORGIA had $231.8 million and $206.3 million
outstanding in short-term notes payable to banks and commercial paper,
respectively. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of March 31, 1999, and the related condensed
statements of income for the three-month periods ended March 31, 1999 and 1998
and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 1999 and 1998. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1998
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 10, 1999, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1998, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                               GULF POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1999 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1998


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter of
1999 was $4.8 million, compared to $6.9 million for the corresponding period of
1998. The earnings decrease is attributed to higher maintenance expenses during
this quarter when compared to the same period in 1998.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                   Increase (Decrease)
                                           -----------------------------------
                                                      First Quarter
                                           -----------------------------------
                                              (in thousands)         %
Revenues..................................     $ (7,118)            (5.3)
Revenues from affiliates..................          674             10.5
Fuel expense..............................       (2,690)            (6.5)
Purchased power from non-affiliates ......         (577)           (12.2)
Purchased power from affiliates...........         (313)            (8.1)
Other operation expense...................       (4,139)           (13.2)
Maintenance expense.......................        3,697             28.7


     Revenues. Revenues for the first quarter decreased due primarily to the
recovery of lower fuel costs. The price per ton of coal, which is GULF's primary
fuel source, was lower in the first quarter of 1999 compared to the same period
in 1998 as the costs related to prior year coal contract renegotiations were
fully amortized by March 1998 and a major coal contract price was reduced.
Excluding recovery of fuel expense and certain other expenses that do not affect
income, retail revenues increased $1.1 million for the quarter. This increase
reflects slightly higher retail energy sales of 0.3%, which can be attributed to
customer growth in the residential and commercial classes. Revenues from
non-territorial wholesale energy sales decreased $2.6 million for the first
quarter of 1999 when compared to the corresponding period of 1998. The decrease
in non-territorial wholesale energy sales was primarily due to decreased sales
through power marketing activities. These sales were largely offset by purchases
from non-affiliates and, as a result, had no significant effect on net income.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. The decrease in fuel expense is attributed to lower fuel
costs, reflecting the reduction of a major coal contract price.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     Purchased power from non-affiliates. Purchased power from non-affiliates
decreased this quarter when compared to the same period in 1998 due primarily to
a decrease in power marketing activities, a majority of which were resold to
non-affiliated third parties. These transactions had no significant effect on 
net income.

     Other operation expense. This item decreased in this quarter when compared
to the same period in 1998 due to prior year payments related to renegotiations
of coal supply contracts being fully amortized by March 1998.

     Maintenance expense.  These costs for the first quarter of 1999 increased
 primarily due to scheduled outages at production facilities.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS "Competition" in the
Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     GULF's plans to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been implemented and are
included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related to GULF's
Year 2000 program are expected to be $4.9 million. From its inception through
March 31, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized as expense, amounted to
$3.7 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION - "Future Earnings
Potential" herein.

     In reference to the ongoing matters with the Florida PSC concerning GULF's
authorized return on equity (ROE) and the outstanding balances of certain
regulatory assets, GULF filed a revised plan on April 6, 1999. The staff
countered with another proposal filed on April 8, 1999. At the agenda conference
on April 20, 1999, the Florida PSC approved the staff's plan with several
modifications. The changes approved by the Florida PSC include the following: a
reduction in the authorized return mid-point from 12.0% to 11.5%, the sharing of
revenues for a period of 3 years above an earnings level of 12.5% ROE up to
14.0% ROE, revenue credits to customers and the write-off of regulatory assets
totaling $7.1 million per year from 1999 through 2001. An order outlining the
changes associated with earnings, revenue sharing, and other regulatory issues
will be issued by the Florida PSC. Any interested party will have the
opportunity to protest the order within 20 days from the date of the order. For
additional information, see Item 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Regulation - State
Commissions" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     The FASB has issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by the year 2000. This
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. Adoption of this statement is not
expected to have a material impact on GULF's financial statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (F) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first three months of
1999 included the addition of approximately $12.5 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

     GULF plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF
under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and
"Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of GULF's
capital requirements for its construction program, environmental compliance
efforts and maturing debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at March 31,
1999, approximately $760 thousand of cash and cash equivalents and $31.5 million
of unused committed lines of credit with banks in addition to $61.9 million
liquidity support for variable rate pollution control bonds. At March 31, 1999,
GULF had $60.0 million of short-term notes payable to banks. Management believes
that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of
credit without maintaining large cash balances.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1999 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1998


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first
quarter of 1999 was $7.2 million compared to $8.4 million for the same period of
1998. The decrease in earnings is attributed to increased operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                     Increase (Decrease)
                                                -------------------------------
                                                        First Quarter
                                                -------------------------------
                                                  (in thousands)        %
Revenues........................................   $     119            0.1
Revenues from affiliates........................         160           18.3
Fuel expense....................................       4,234           15.5
Purchased power from non-affiliates ............      (1,955)         (45.5)
Purchased power from affiliates.................      (2,394)         (21.2)
Other operation expense.........................       3,201           13.4



     Revenues. The slight improvement in revenues for this quarter reflects
increased energy sales in the retail sector, in particular to commercial
customers. This revenue increase was partially offset by a decrease in
non-territorial energy sales. Revenues from territorial energy sales increased
$3.2 million and revenues from non-territorial energy sales decreased $2.3
million. Energy sales to commercial customers increased due to increased tourism
and continued growth in this sector. Retail revenues, excluding those revenues
which represent the recovery of fuel expense and certain other expenses and do
not affect income, decreased $650 thousand for the current quarter. Wholesale
territorial revenues, excluding fuel revenues which do not affect income,
increased $3.1 million for the current quarter.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION




     Fuel expense. These costs increased during the current quarter due to an
increase in generation resulting from a higher demand for energy.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. This item decreased when compared to
the same period in 1998 due primarily to increased availability of generation
from MISSISSIPPI's generating plants.

     Other operation expense. The increase for this quarter compared to the same
period in 1998 is attributed primarily to increased administrative and general
expenses. The expenses rose due to higher amortization of deferred costs for the
work force reduction plan and increased Year 2000 expenses.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment. Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in rates under
the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force on electric
rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking place.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. MISSISSIPPI's 1999 ECO Plan filing was approved, as
filed, by the Mississippi PSC on March 18, 1999 and resulted in a slight
increase in customer prices. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     MISSISSIPPI's plans to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been implemented
and are included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related
to MISSISSIPPI's Year 2000 program are expected to be $4.9 million. From its
inception through March 31, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized as
expense, amounted to $3.9 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION - "Future Earnings Potential" herein.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     The FASB has issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by the year 2000. This
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. MISSISSIPPI has not yet quantified the
impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements; however, the
adoption could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (F) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first three months
of 1999 included the addition of approximately $12.9 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
for further details.

Financing Activities

     MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

In April 1999, MISSISSIPPI and Escatawpa Funding ("Escatawpa"), a limited
partnership, entered into a lease agreement whereby MISSISSIPPI will design and
construct, as agent for Escatawpa, a 1,064 megawatt natural gas combined cycle
facility. It is expected that the project will cost approximately $406 million,
and upon completion of the facility, MISSISSIPPI will lease the facility from
Escatawpa for an initial term of approximately 10 years. For additional 
information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND 
ANALYSIS - "Capital Requirements for Construction" of MISSISSIPPI and Notes 3 
and 4 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of
MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its construction program, environmental
compliance efforts, sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at March
31, 1999, approximately $1.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $76.3 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks
(including $10.8 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made
only to fund purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control
bonds). At March 31, 1999, MISSISSIPPI had short-term notes payable outstanding
of $61.5 million. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1999 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1998


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter
of 1999 was $1.2 million as compared to $2.4 million for the same period of
1998. The earnings decrease is attributed to lower operating revenues and
increased operating expenses, both reflecting the Georgia PSC's accounting
order. For additional information, see Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for details regarding the accounting order.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                   Increase (Decrease)

Revenues.......................................    $(1,477)          (3.1)
Fuel expense...................................        785           13.5
Maintenance expense............................        761           20.7
Depreciation and amortization expense..........        719           13.7
Interest on long-term debt.....................        450           16.6
Dividends on preferred stock...................       (581)        (100.0)

     Revenues. The drop in first quarter 1999 revenues is primarily attributed
to a decrease in total energy sales primarily to territorial customers and the
tariff reduction implemented as a part of the Georgia PSC accounting order.
Territorial energy sales to residential and commercial customers were up 3.4%
and 1.3%, but were down 30.9% to industrial customers. Energy sales were down to
industrial customers due to low demand from one industrial customer and the
shut-down of another industrial customer's facilities. For additional
information, see "Future Earnings Potential" herein.

     Fuel expenses.  These costs rose from the same period in 1998 due to 
higher generation and a change in fuel mix.

     Maintenance expense.  The first quarter of 1999 increase is attributed
primarily to the timing of maintenance expenses at steam generating facilities.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. This item increased during this
quarter compared to the corresponding period in 1998 due mainly to additional
depreciation charges pursuant to the Georgia PSC accounting order.

     Interest on long-term debt. During the first quarter of 1999, interest on
long-term debt increased when compared to the same period in 1998 due to a
higher level of debt.

     Dividends on preferred stock.  The change in this item is a direct result
of the redemption in November 1998 of all of SAVANNAH's outstanding preferred
stock.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     In June 1998, the Georgia PSC approved a four-year accounting order for
SAVANNAH. Reference is made to Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial

Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     In August, 1998, one of SAVANNAH's largest industrial customers added its
own steam turbine unit. The impact to SAVANNAH's revenues from one period to the
next will be determined by the reliability of the unit and market conditions.
Further, in October 1998, another of Savannah's largest customers shut-down its
Savannah operations indefinitely. Base revenues from this customer had averaged
$2 million annually or approximately $500 thousand per quarter. Under the terms
of SAVANNAH's contract this customer is obligated to pay $1.1 million annually
through 2004. In the first quarter of 1999, the impact on SAVANNAH's revenues
from this shut-down was $0.2 million.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH
in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     SAVANNAH's plans to achieve Year 2000 readiness have been implemented and
are included in the SOUTHERN system's Year 2000 Program. The costs related to
SAVANNAH's Year 2000 program are expected to be $1.2 million. From its inception
through March 31, 1999, the Year 2000 program costs, recognized as expense,
amounted to $0.9 million. For additional information, see SOUTHERN's
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION - "Future Earnings Potential" herein.

     The FASB has issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by the year 2000. This
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. SAVANNAH has not yet quantified the
impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements; however, the
adoption could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first three months of
1999 included the addition of approximately $9.4 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See SAVANNAH's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

     SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at March 31,
1999, approximately $3.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$54 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. At March 31, 1999,
SAVANNAH had $6.5 million outstanding of notes payable to banks. Since SAVANNAH
has no major generating plants under construction, management believes that the
need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)  The condensed financial  statements of the registrants included herein have
     been prepared by each registrant,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and
     regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of each registrant's management, the
     information   regarding  such  registrant  furnished  herein  reflects  all
     adjustments  necessary to present  fairly the results for the periods ended
     March 31,  1999 and 1998.  Certain  information  and  footnote  disclosures
     normally  included in  financial  statements  prepared in  accordance  with
     generally  accepted  accounting  principles  have been condensed or omitted
     pursuant to such rules and regulations,  although each registrant  believes
     that the  disclosures  regarding  such  registrant are adequate to make the
     information presented not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed
     financial  statements be read in conjunction with the financial  statements
     and the notes thereto included in each registrant's latest annual report on
     Form 10-K.  Certain prior period amounts have been  reclassified to conform
     with current period presentation.

         The condensed financial statements of ALABAMA and GEORGIA included
      herein have been reviewed by ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's independent public
      accountants as set forth in their reports included herein as Exhibit 1 to
      ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)   SOUTHERN's operating affiliates are subject to the provisions of FASB
      Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
      Regulation. In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no
      longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
      off related unrecoverable regulatory assets and liabilities, and determine
      if any other assets have been impaired. For additional information, see
      Note 1 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the
      Form 10-K.

(C)   The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
      practices of the electric utility industry--including
      SOUTHERN's--regarding the recognition, measurement and classification of
      decommissioning costs for nuclear generating facilities in the financial
      statements. In response to these questions, the FASB has decided to review
      the accounting for obligations related to the retirement of long-lived
      assets, including nuclear decommissioning. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
      SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial
      statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA under "Depreciation and
      Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)   SOUTHERN engages in price risk management activities. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Derivative Financial Instruments"
      and Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for a discussion of these activities. Activities for non-trading
      purposes consist of transactions that are employed to mitigate SOUTHERN's
      risk related to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate
      fluctuations. At March 31, 1999, the status of outstanding non-trading
      related derivative contracts was as follows:

      In January 1998, Southern Energy and Vastar Resources, Inc. combined their
      energy trading and marketing activities to form a joint venture. Southern
      Energy's investment in the joint venture is accounted for under the equity
      method of accounting. SOUTHERN and Vastar have jointly made guarantees to
      certain counterparties regarding performance of contractual commitments by
      the joint venture. At March 31, 1999, outstanding guarantees related to
      the estimated fair value of net contractual commitments were approximately
      $79 million. Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
      "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in Item 7 and Note 1 to the
      financial statements of SOUTHERN under "Financial Instruments for Trading
      Activities" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(E)   SOUTHERN's principal business segment -- or its traditional core business
      -- is the five regulated electric utility operating companies that provide
      electric service in four southeastern states. The other reportable
      business segment is non-traditional energy services provided by Southern
      Energy, which develops and manages electricity and other energy-related
      projects both in the United States and abroad. Intersegment revenues are
      not material. Financial data for business segments for the periods covered
      in the Form 10-Q are as follows:

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


      (Note) The all other category includes parent SOUTHERN, which does not
      allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category
      includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate
      disclosure. These segments include a wireless communication company and a
      developmental company for energy products and services. Non-traditional
      services exclude interest expense to parent SOUTHERN.

(F)   Reference is made to Notes 3 and 7 to each of the registrant's financial
      statements, except SAVANNAH'S, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a discussion
      of the FERC orders in proceedings regarding the reasonableness of the
      return on common equity on certain of the Southern electric system's
      wholesale rate schedules and contracts and a discussion of the long-term
      power sales agreements. On April 19, 1999, the FERC entered an order
      dismissing the request for rehearing filed by customers under long-term
      power sales agreements. The parties are engaged in discussions with a view
      toward settlement of the proceedings which remain pending at FERC, but the
      ultimate outcome of these discussions cannot now be determined.


(G)   During the first three months of 1999, statutory business trusts, formed
      by ALABAMA and GEORGIA of which such companies own all the common
      securities, issued mandatorily redeemable preferred securities as follows:

</TABLE>

      Substantially all the assets of each trust are junior subordinated notes
      issued by the related company in the respective approximate principal
      amounts set forth above. ALABAMA and GEORGIA consider that the mechanisms
      and obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its
      benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by
      it of the respective trusts' payment obligations with respect to the
      preferred securities.

(H)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and 
      ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to retail 
      rate adjustment procedures.

(I)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to a judgment
      against ALABAMA arising from discharges into Lake Martin. The trial court
      has denied the defendants' motion for a new trial and for remittitur, and
      ALABAMA has appealed to the Supreme Court of Alabama.

(J)   In 1996, legal actions against ALABAMA were filed in several counties in
      Alabama charging ALABAMA with fraud and non-compliance with regulatory
      statutes relating to the offer, sale and financing of "extended service
      contracts" in connection with the sale of electric appliances. See Note 3
      to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for additional information.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)



(K)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information concerning a three-year
      rate order approved by the Georgia PSC effective January 1, 1999. The
      order decreased annual retail rates by $262 million effective January 1,
      1999 and by an additional $24 million effective January 1, 2000. The order
      further provides for $85 million each year, plus up to $50 million
      annually of any earnings in excess of a 12.5% retail return on common
      equity during the second and third years, to be applied to accelerated
      amortization or depreciation of assets. Two-thirds of any additional
      earnings in excess of the 12.5% return will be applied to rate reductions
      and the remaining one-third retained by GEORGIA.

(L)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
      designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
      Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
      environmental contingencies.

(M)  In September  1998,  OPC decreased its purchases of capacity  under a power
     supply agreement by 250 megawatts,  resulting in a $16 million reduction in
     1999 revenues.  Under the amended 1995 Integrated Resource Plan approved by
     the Georgia PSC in March 1997, the resources  associated with the decreased
     purchases  in 1998  will be used to meet  the  needs  of  GEORGIA's  retail
     customers  through 2004. As a result of additional  reduction notices given
     by OPC  under its  agreement  with  GEORGIA,  GEORGIA's  capacity  revenues
     received from OPC were estimated to decrease by an additional $7 million in
     1999, $18 million in 2000 and $4 million in 2001.  Effective April 1, 1999,
     GEORGIA and OPC entered  into a new  agreement  which will delay,  in part,
     planned  purchase  reductions by OPC. The new agreement has been filed with
     the FERC under SOUTHERN's market-based rate authority.  Based on the above,
     GEORGIA's capacity revenues received from OPC are now estimated to decrease
     by  approximately $6 million in 1999, $15 million in 2000 and $7 million in
     2001.

(N)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SAVANNAH in
      Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information concerning the four-year
      accounting order approved by the Georgia PSC in June 1998.

(O)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item
     8 and to  Legal  Proceedings  in Item 3 of the Form  10-K  for  information
     relating to petitions for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  relief which were filed in
     the U. S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Alabama.  Effective
     with the bankruptcy  filing in January 1999, Mobile Energy is accounted for
     under  the  equity  method,  rather  than  being  consolidated  as  before.
     SOUTHERN's  equity investment in Mobile Energy was $56 million at March 31,
     1999. At March 31, 1999, Mobile Energy had total assets of $372 million and
     senior debt  outstanding  of $203 million of first  mortgage  bonds and $77
     million   related  to  tax-exempt   bonds.  In  connection  with  the  bond
     financings,  SOUTHERN  provided  certain  limited  guarantees,  in  lieu of
     funding debt service and maintenance  reserve  accounts with cash. In March
     1999,  under an agreement with the  bondholders,  SOUTHERN paid $36,144,000
     pursuant to the guarantees.  The bondholders  reserved the right to seek an
     additional $2,700,000,  which SOUTHERN believes was satisfied by an earlier
     transfer  of funds.  The  ultimate  outcome  of this  matter  cannot now be
     determined.

(P)   In 1998, SOUTHERN's Board of Directors authorized SOUTHERN to make open
      market purchases of its common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed
      $300 million through March 31, 1999. The purpose of the program was to
      provide shares of common stock for the purchase requirements of SOUTHERN's
      various stockholder, employee and outside director stock purchase plans.
      Under the program, 41,000 shares were sold in the quarter ended March 31,
      1999.

      Also, in April 1999, SOUTHERN's board approved the repurchase of up to 50
      million shares of SOUTHERN's common stock over the next two years through
      open market or privately negotiated transactions. The program does not
      establish a target stock price or timetable for specific repurchases.
      Under this program, 4,116,800 shares have been repurchased through May 12,
      1999, with funding provided from SOUTHERN's commercial paper program.
