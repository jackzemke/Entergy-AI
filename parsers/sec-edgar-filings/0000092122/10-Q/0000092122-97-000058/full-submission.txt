RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SOUTHERN's consolidated net income for the third quarter and year-to-date 1997 
was $375 million ($0.55 per share) and $777 million ($1.14 per share), 
respectively, compared to $467 million ($0.69 per share) and $988 million 
($1.47 per share) for the corresponding periods of 1996.  Earnings decreased 
19.8% and 21.4% for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively due to several 
factors. These factors included a windfall profit tax imposed by the government
of the United Kingdom on SWEB and increased depreciation and amortization 
expenses. The windfall profit tax caused a one-time charge in the third quarter
reducing earnings by $111 million or about $0.16 per share, after giving effect
to minority interest. 

     SOUTHERN's traditional core business is primarily represented by its five 
domestic electric utility operating companies, which provide electric service 
in four Southeastern states. Another significant portion of SOUTHERN's business
is its non-traditional business primarily represented by Southern Energy, which
owns and manages international and domestic businesses for SOUTHERN. Businesses
acquired by Southern Energy have been included in the consolidated statements of
income since the date of acquisition. Certain changes in operating revenues and
expenses from the prior period are the result of such acquisitions.

                 THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


    Operating revenues. Operating revenues for the traditional core business
for the third quarter increased $207 million or 8.1% and year-to-date decreased
$33 million or 0.5%, compared to the corresponding periods of 1996. Operating
revenues for non-traditional business were up $931 million or 260.2% for the
quarter and $1.480 billion or 128.5% for year-to-date. The increase in third
quarter traditional core revenues was mainly due to a 5.6% increase in energy
sales during the quarter. Energy sales to the residential, commercial and
industrial sectors increased by 5.7%, 5.4% and 4.1%, respectively. The decrease
in year-to-date traditional core revenues was mainly due to the 5.2% decrease in
energy sales to residential customers. This decrease in energy sales was a
result of milder-than-normal weather experienced throughout the operating
companies' service areas. Non-traditional operating revenues increased for the
quarter and year-to-date due primarily to increased sales by Southern Energy's
energy marketing organization. These revenues were $883 million and $1.313
billion for the current quarter and year-to-date 1997, respectively.

     Purchased power expense. For the third quarter, purchased power expenses
for the traditional core business rose by 35.3% while year-to-date traditional
core business purchased power expenses fell by 5.5%. The increase for the
quarter was primarily due to increased energy sales to residential, commercial
and industrial customers. The decrease year-to-date was primarily due to
decreased energy sales to residential customers. For non-traditional business,
purchased power expenses rose 466.9% and 225.8% for the quarter and year-to-date
1997. These increases are primarily due to the power purchasing activities of
Southern Energy's energy marketing organization. These power purchases rose by
$866 million for the quarter and $1.288 billion year-to-date.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization
expense of the traditional core business for the quarter and year-to-date
increased compared to the corresponding periods in 1996. These increases can be
attributed primarily to additional depreciation charges of $76.7 million and
$104.9 million, respectively for the quarter and year-to-date 1997 pursuant to
GEORGIA's retail accounting order as discussed in Note (L) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein. Additions to utility plant further
contributed to the increase in depreciation and amortization for the quarter and
year-to-date 1997. The acquisition of CEPA is the primary cause for the
increases in non-traditional business depreciation and amortization expense for
the quarter and year-to-date. These expenses increased by $23.6 million and
$63.0 million for the respective periods.

     Taxes other than income taxes. Taxes other than income taxes decreased for
the third quarter and year-to-date 1997 when compared to the same periods of
1996 primarily due to reductions of $17.7 million for the quarter and $51.4
million year-to-date attributable to SWEB. These decreases resulted from the
lowering, in November 1996, of the taxes on electricity sales in the United
Kingdom from 10% to 3.7%. 

     Interest income. The increase in interest income for
the quarter and year-to-date as compared to the corresponding periods of 1996,
is due to a $14.2 million increase for the quarter and a $33.4 million increase
year-to-date in interest income for the non-traditional business, primarily
CEPA.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Income taxes applicable to other income. The decreases for the quarter and
year-to-date 1997 when compared to the same periods in 1996 is primarily due to
increased tax benefits from increased interest expense at the corporate level
and to taxes relating to the sale, in July 1996, of a 25% interest in SWEB.

     United Kingdom Windfall Profit Tax. This item represents 100% of the
Windfall Profit Tax applicable to SWEB before giving effect to a 25% minority
interest ownership. See Note (R) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for further details.

     Interest on long-term debt. Interest on long-term debt for the quarter and
year-to-date 1997 compared to the same periods of 1996, increased primarily due
to the CEPA acquisition. Southern Energy's interest on long-term debt increased
$43.3 million for the quarter and $92.6 million year-to-date 1997 compared to
the corresponding periods in 1996, mainly as a result of that acquisition.

     Interest on notes payable. The decreases for the quarter and year-to-date
when compared to the same periods of 1996, is primarily due to a reduction in 
the amount of notes payable outstanding for the non-traditional business.

     Minority interest in subsidiaries. The decrease in minority interest for
the quarter results from the recording of the effect of the windfall profit tax.
Such tax also affected year-to-date 1997 results; however, its effect was
somewhat offset due to minority interests in other consolidated subsidiaries.

     Distributions on capital and preferred securities of subsidiaries. This
increase for the quarter and year-to-date 1997 resulted from the sales of
securities in 1996 and the first half of 1997. See Note (I) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information.

     Preferred dividends of subsidiary companies. The decrease in this item for
the quarter and year-to-date when compared to the corresponding periods in 1997
is due to redemptions of preferred stock, including redemptions during the
first, second and third quarters of 1997. See "Financing Activities" herein for
additional information. 

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment, with non-traditional business becoming more significant.

     On September 29, 1997, SOUTHERN, through Southern Energy, completed its
purchase of 26% of the outstanding common stock of Berliner Kraft und Licht AG
(Bewag), the vertically integrated electric utility that serves Berlin, Germany,
for approximately $820 million. That investment is accounted for under the
equity method.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


   In July 1997, Southern Energy entered into an agreement to acquire Hopewell
Holdings Limited's (Hopewell) 19.99% share of CEPA. Under this agreement, which
closed on August 13, 1997, Southern Energy bought from Hopewell its CEPA shares
in exchange for $150 million and CEPA's 80% interest in the Tanjung Jati B
Project. The Tanjung Jati B Project is a 1,320 megawatt coal-fired power station
under development in Central Java, Indonesia. As a result of the transaction,
Southern Energy now owns over 99.9% of CEPA's shares.

     In August 1997, Southern Energy entered into an agreement with Vastar
Resources Inc. (Vastar) providing for the organization of a limited partnership
to which the parties are to contribute their gas and power trading and marketing
businesses. Southern Energy and Vastar initially acquired indirect ownership
interests of 60% and 40%, respectively, of the new entity. In September 1997,
Southern Energy contributed its gas marketing operations to the partnership and
made a cash payment of $40 million into escrow for Vastar's account.

     For additional information relating to non-traditional business activities,
including information relating to the acquisition of Southern Energy's interest
in CEPA, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "New Business Development" in the Form 10-K.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     In July 1997, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA")
published revisions to the ambient air quality standards for ozone and
particulate matter, making the standards significantly more stringent. In
addition, in October 1997, EPA issued a proposed rule which, if implemented as
proposed, would require substantial further reductions in NOx emissions from
fossil-fueled generating facilities. Implementation of the above-described
standards and proposed rules would result in increased compliance costs and
capital expenditures for the operating companies in amounts that cannot be
determined at this time.

     In February, 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share.
The standard simplifies the computation of earnings per share (EPS) required by
existing rules. SOUTHERN will adopt this standard on December 31, 1997. If EPS
amounts were computed as specified by Statement No. 128, basic EPS and diluted
EPS would be equal, and would equal the amounts currently reported in the
"Condensed Statements of Income."

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of "comprehensive
income," which is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in
stockholders' equity, and its components. SOUTHERN will adopt the standard in
1998.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related  Information.  Statement No. 131, which  supersedes
Statement  Nos.  14,  18,  24 and 30,  establishes  new  standards  for  segment
reporting,  using the "management  approach," in which  reportable  segments are
based on the same  criteria on which  management  disaggregates  a business  for
making operating decisions and assessing performance. SOUTHERN is in the process
of  evaluating  Statement  No. 131 and its impact and will adopt the standard by
1998.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (D), (G), (J), (K), (L), (M), (N) and
(P) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion
of various contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings
potential. Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings"
herein.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first nine months of
1997 included the addition of approximately $1.2 billion to utility plant and
the acquisition of CEPA. The funds for these additions and other capital
requirements were from operations and sales of securities. See SOUTHERN's
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first nine months of 1997, retirements of the operating companies'
first mortgage bonds totaled $109 million and redemptions of preferred stock
totaled $428 million. Subsidiaries of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF and
MISSISSIPPI have formed statutory business trusts which sold, during the first
nine months of 1997, an aggregate of $1.3 billion of trust preferred or capital
securities. See Note (I) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements"
herein for further details.

     During the first nine months of 1997, SOUTHERN raised $271 million from the
issuance of new common stock under SOUTHERN's various stock plans. The market
price of SOUTHERN's common stock at September 30, 1997 was $22.5625 per share
and the book value was $13.90 per share, representing a market-to-book ratio of
162%, compared to $22.625, $13.61 and 166%, respectively, at the end of 1996.
The dividend for the third quarter of 1997 was $0.325 per share.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of SOUTHERN
under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and
"Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern
electric system's capital requirements for its construction program,
environmental compliance efforts, sinking fund requirements and maturing debt.
Approximately $709 million will be required by September 30, 1998, for present
sinking fund requirements, redemption of preferred stock and redemptions and
maturities of long-term debt. Also, the operating companies plan to continue, to
the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock
and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 1997, as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
Currently, each of the operating companies expects to have adequate earnings
coverage ratios for any anticipated security sales through at least 1999. See
Item 1 BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
September 30, 1997, approximately $620 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $4,265 million of unused credit arrangements with banks (including
$1,160 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made only to
fund purchase obligations of the operating companies relating to variable rate
pollution control bonds). At September 30, 1997, the system companies had
outstanding approximately $218 million of short-term notes payable and $1,653
million of commercial paper. Since SOUTHERN's construction program with respect
to major generating projects in the traditional core business has been
completed, management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

     See Note (D) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for discussion of financial derivative contracts entered into by SOUTHERN.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter
and year-to-date 1997 was $191.8 million and $312.7 million, respectively,
compared to $152.6 million and $321.5 million for the corresponding periods of
1996. Earnings increased 25.7% for this quarter due primarily to a rise in
energy sales. Year-to-date earnings decreased 2.7% when compared to the
corresponding period in 1996 due mainly to milder-than-normal temperatures
during the first half of 1997 .

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses and do not affect net income, revenues for the third quarter increased
$28.7 million and decreased for year-to-date 1997 $27.8 million, compared to the
corresponding periods of 1996. The increase in third quarter revenues can be
attributed primarily to a 6.7% increase in total retail energy sales. The
increase in retail energy sales is due primarily to relatively normal weather
compared to milder weather in the third quarter of 1996. Energy sales to
residential, commercial, and industrial customers were up by 5.8%, 6.3% and
7.7%, respectively for the quarter. The drop in year-to-date revenues resulted
primarily from decreases in prices charged to industrial and commercial
customers and a decrease in energy sales to residential customers of 5.2%. The
decrease in energy sales to residential customers is primarily due to
milder-than-normal temperatures during the first half of 1997.

     Revenues from affiliates. Revenues from sales to affiliated companies
within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on
demand, the availability, and cost of generating resources at each company.
These transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increase for the quarter compared
to the corresponding period of 1996 resulted primarily from increased purchases
in connection with power marketing activities, the majority of which were resold
to non-affiliated third parties. These transactions had no significant effect on
net income.

     Maintenance expense. The decrease during the third quarter when compared to
the same period in 1996 was due to the reclassification in 1996 of expenses
charged to operations and the write-off of obsolete steam generating plant
inventory, accompanied by overall cost reduction efforts in 1997.

     Income taxes applicable to other income. This increase for the quarter when
compared to the corresponding period in 1996 is primarily a result of increased
tax benefits from losses of the parent company allocated to ALABAMA under the
joint consolidated income tax agreement between SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries .
The year-to-date decrease in income taxes applicable to other income can be
attributed to ALABAMA's donation, in June 1996, of certain nonutility property
which resulted in a reduction of income taxes applicable to other income of
approximately $10.6 million.

     Amortization of debt discount, premium and expense, net. The decrease in
this item for the current quarter and year-to-date compared to the same periods
of 1996 is the result of ALABAMA's reducing the asset account related to
premiums incurred in connection with the refinancing of high cost debt by $5.0
million and $8.0 million in February and July 1996, respectively, as allowed by
the Alabama PSC. See Note (J) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for further details.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. The change in
this item resulted primarily from the issuance of additional mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities. For additional information, see Item 7
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital Structure" of ALABAMA in the
Form 10-K.

     Dividends on preferred stock. The decrease for the quarter and year-to-date
1997, compared to the corresponding periods of 1996, resulted from redemptions
of preferred stock in the first nine months of 1997.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in
the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     In July 1997, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA")
published revisions to the ambient air quality standards for ozone and
particulate matter, making the standards significantly more stringent. In
addition, in October 1997, EPA issued a proposed rule which, if implemented as
proposed, would require substantial further reductions in NOx emissions from
fossil-fueled generating facilities. Implementation of the above-described
standards and proposed rules would result in increased compliance costs and
capital expenditures for the operating companies in amounts that cannot be
determined at this time.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of "comprehensive
income," which is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in
stockholders' equity, and its components. The standard is effective in 1998. It
is not expected to affect ALABAMA's financial reporting.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related  Information.  Statement No. 131, which  supersedes
Statement  Nos.  14,  18,  24 and 30,  establishes  new  standards  for  segment
reporting,  using the "management  approach," in which  reportable  segments are
based on the same  criteria on which  management  disaggregates  a business  for
making operating decisions and assessing performance.  ALABAMA is in the process
of  evaluating  Statement  No. 131 and its impact and will adopt the standard by
1998.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (G), (H), (J) and (K) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first nine months of
1997 included the addition of approximately $290.2 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Financing Activities

During the first nine months of 1997, redemptions of first mortgage bonds and
preferred stock of ALABAMA totaled $181.8 million. Also, Alabama Power Capital
Trust II, a statutory business trust established for the purpose of holding
ALABAMA's junior subordinated notes and issuing trust preferred securities and
common securities, sold $200.0 million of its 7.60% trust originated preferred
securities which are guaranteed by ALABAMA. For additional information, see Note
(I) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital Structure" of ALABAMA in the
Form 10-K. In addition, ALABAMA has announced its plans to redeem an aggregate
of approximately $80.0 million of first mortgage bonds in November 1997 and
January 1998.

     ALABAMA will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and
replace these securities with lower-cost capital, if market conditions permit.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Capital Requirements

Capital expenditures are estimated to be $463 million for 1997, $615 million for
1998, and $723 million for 1999. The total is $1.8 billion for the three years.
Actual capital costs may vary from this estimate because of factors such as
changes in business conditions; revised load growth projections; changes in
environmental regulations; changes in the existing nuclear plant to meet new
regulatory requirements; increasing cost of labor, equipment, and materials; and
cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to
capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

     ALABAMA will replace all six steam generators at Plant Farley at a total
cost of approximately $202 million. Additionally, subject to requisite
regulatory approval, ALABAMA plans to construct and install new generating
capacity and transmission facilities at Plant Barry. The increase in projected
capital expenditures for this project is approximately $85 million.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
ALABAMA under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital
requirements for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental
compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
ALABAMA expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any anticipated
security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at September
30, 1997, approximately $14.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and had
unused committed lines of credit of approximately $813.6 million (including
$208.2 million of such lines under which borrowings may be made only to fund
purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds) with
regulatory authority for up to $750 million of short-term borrowings. At
September 30, 1997, ALABAMA had no outstanding short-term notes payable to banks
and $419.9 million of commercial paper.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of September 30, 1997, and the related condensed statements of income
and cash flows for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30,
1997 and 1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a

conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter
and year-to-date 1997 was $257.4 million and $494.0 million, respectively,
compared to $255.5 million and $524.2 million for the corresponding periods in
1996. Earnings for this quarter increased slightly above the same period in 1996
while year-to-date earnings decreased 5.8% compared to the same period in 1996.
This year-to-date earnings decrease resulted primarily from lower revenues due
to milder-than-normal weather and additional depreciation charges pursuant to a
Georgia PSC retail accounting order discussed below.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses and do not affect income, revenues for the third quarter of 1997
increased $62.4 million and for year-to-date 1997 decreased $45.7 million,
compared to the corresponding periods of 1996. Retail revenues, excluding fuel
revenues, increased 6.8%, or $63.7 million for the current quarter and decreased
1.7%, or $40.9 million year-to-date as compared to the corresponding periods of
1996. The increase in third quarter retail revenues was primarily due to
increased energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers of
5.5%, 4.6% and 1.3%, respectively.

     The decrease in year-to-date retail revenues can be attributed to lower
energy sales in the residential sector as well as industrial customers taking
advantage of load management rates. Year-to-date sales to residential customers
dropped 5.7% while sales to commercial and industrial customers increased
slightly by 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively. The year-to-date decrease in
residential sales is a result of the milder-than-normal temperatures experienced
during 1997.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. The increase for the current quarter is primarily due to
increased generation resulting from higher energy sales.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The current quarter increase in
purchased power from non-affiliates is primarily due to an increase in energy
purchases in connection with power marketing activities, the majority of which
were resold to non-affiliated third parties. These transactions had no
significant effect on net income.

     Maintenance expense. The increase in the current quarter from the
corresponding period of 1996 is primarily due to an increase in transmission and
distribution line maintenance.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in depreciation and
amortization for the current quarter and year-to-date compared to the same
period of 1996 is primarily due to additional depreciation charges of $76.7
million and $104.9 million, respectively, pursuant to a Georgia PSC retail
accounting order discussed below. See "Future Earnings Potential" below and Note
(L) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further
details.

     Other, net. The decrease for the current quarter and year-to-date is
primarily the result of expenses incurred in connection with activities related
to the 1996 Summer Olympic games.

     Income taxes applicable to other income. The change for the current quarter
and year-to-date is primarily the result of increased tax benefits from losses
of the parent company allocated to GEORGIA under the joint consolidated income
tax agreement between SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary companies. The increase
in this item resulted primarily from the issuance of additional mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities in August 1996, January 1997 and June 1997. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Financing Activities" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K, and Note (I) in the "Notes
to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein.

     Dividends on preferred stock. The decrease in dividends on preferred stock
for the current quarter and year-to-date results from the redemption of various
issues of such securities.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in
the Form 10-K.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Effective January 1, 1996, GEORGIA began operating under a three-year
retail accounting order. Under the order, GEORGIA's earnings are evaluated
against a retail return on common equity range of 10% to 12.5%. GEORGIA is
required to absorb cost increases of approximately $29.0 million annually during
the order's three-year operation, including $14.0 million annually of
accelerated depreciation of electric plant. Reference is made to Note (L) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information.

     The staff of the Georgia PSC has issued a report regarding its prudence
review of the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric plant. Reference is
made to Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for
additional information.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.

     In July 1997, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA")
published revisions to the ambient air quality standards for ozone and
particulate matter, making the standards significantly more stringent. In
addition, in October 1997, EPA issued a proposed rule which, if implemented as
proposed, would require substantial further reductions in NOx emissions from
fossil-fueled generating facilities. Implementation of the above-described
standards and proposed rules would result in increased compliance costs and
capital expenditures for the operating companies in amounts that cannot be
determined at this time.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of "comprehensive
income," which is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in
stockholders' equity, and its components. The standard is effective in 1998. It
is not expected to affect GEORGIA's financial reporting.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related  Information.  Statement No. 131, which  supersedes
Statement  Nos.  14,  18,  24 and 30,  establishes  new  standards  for  segment
reporting,  using the "management  approach," in which  reportable  segments are
based on the same  criteria on which  management  disaggregates  a business  for
making operating decisions and assessing performance.  GEORGIA is in the process
of  evaluating  Statement  No. 131 and its impact and will adopt the standard by
1998.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (G) and (L) through (P) in the "Notes
to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first nine months
of 1997 was the addition of approximately $327.8 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Financing Activities

During the first nine months of 1997, maturities and redemptions of first
mortgage bonds and preferred stock by GEORGIA totaled $252.2 million. In January
1997, Georgia Power Capital Trust II, a statutory business trust established for
the purpose of holding GEORGIA's junior subordinated notes and issuing trust
preferred securities and common securities, sold $175.0 million of its 7.60%
trust preferred securities, which are guaranteed by GEORGIA. (See Note (I) in
the " Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Financing Activities" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K for
further details.)

     In April 1997, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, $90.0 million of
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds due 2032. The proceeds were
applied to the redemption on July 1, 1997 of $90.0 million outstanding principal
amount of 8.375% pollution control revenue bonds.

     In June 1997, Georgia Power Capital Trust III , a statutory business trust
established for the purpose of holding GEORGIA's junior subordinated notes and
issuing trust preferred securities and common securities, sold $189.3 million of
its 7.75% quarterly income preferred securities, which are guaranteed by
GEORGIA. (See Note (I) in the " Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" for
further details.)

     In September 1997, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, $194.7 million
of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds with $144.7 million due in 2029
and $50.0 million due in 2034. The proceeds were used to redeem $105.9 million
aggregate principal amount of 6.20% pollution control revenue bonds and $38.8
million aggregate principal amount of 5.70% pollution control revenue bonds in
September 1997. The remaining proceeds will be used to redeem $50.0 million
aggregate principal amount of 9 3/8% pollution control revenue bonds in December
1997.

     GEORGIA has announced the planned redemption of $28.9 million of preferred
stock in December 1997.

     GEORGIA plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Issues" in the
Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital requirements for its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
GEORGIA expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any anticipated
security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at September
30, 1997, approximately $170.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $1,143.9 million of unused credit arrangements with banks
(including $878.9 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be
made only to fund purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution
control bonds). At September 30, 1997, GEORGIA had no outstanding short-term
notes payable to banks or commercial paper. Since GEORGIA has no major
generating plants under construction, management believes that the need for
working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of September 30, 1997, and the related
condensed statements of income and cash flows for the three-month and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 1997 and 1996. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1996
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 12, 1997, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1996, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter and
year-to-date 1997 was $27.5 million and $48.6 million, respectively, compared to
$23.7 million and $47.6 million for the corresponding periods of 1996. Earnings
for the quarter and year-to-date 1997 compared to the same periods in 1996
increased 15.9% and 2.2%, respectively. The increase for the current quarter was
due primarily to increased energy sales.

     Revenues. Excluding fuel and other revenues which represent the
pass-through of fuel expense and certain other expenses and do not affect net
income, revenues increased $6.3 million or 6.2% for the third quarter and
decreased $3.5 million or 1.3% year-to-date 1997, compared to the corresponding
periods of 1996. Retail revenues rose 4.9% for the current quarter primarily due
to an increase in retail sales as a result of warmer weather during the third
quarter; however, retail revenues fell 1.6% year-to-date primarily due to a
decrease in energy sales to residential customers reflecting the impact of
milder-than-normal temperatures during the first half of 1997. Energy sales to
industrial customers increased 7.2% and 4.6% for the quarter and year-to-date,
respectively; however, revenues from this sector increased by only 2.0% for the
quarter and decreased by 0.3% year-to-date 1997. The disparity between
industrial energy sales and industrial revenues is primarily due to increased
participation in the Real-Time-Pricing program. See Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K
for information on initiatives to remain competitive and to meet conservation
goals set by the Florida PSC.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. The
year-to-date decrease in purchased power from affiliates compared to the
corresponding period in 1996 can be attributed to maintenance outages at Plant
Crist and Plant Daniel during the first half of 1996. Revenues from sales to
affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as purchases
of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. The current quarter increase in fuel expense is due to
increased generation as a result of warmer weather and increased energy sales
during the third quarter.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increases in purchased power from
non-affiliates can primarily be attributed to an increase in energy purchases
due to increased power marketing activities, the majority of which were resold
to non-affiliated third parties. These transactions had no significant effect on
net income.

     Other operation expense. The current quarter and year-to-date increases
were primarily due to an increase in amortization costs related to the buyout
and renegotiation of a coal supply contract.

     Maintenance expense. The increase in maintenance expense for the third
quarter is primarily due to routine maintenance, while the year-to-date decrease
is primarily attributed to the scheduled maintenance on production facilities
which occurred in the first half of 1996 at Plant Crist and Plant Daniel.

     Income taxes applicable to other income. The change for the third quarter
and year-to-date when compared to the corresponding periods of 1996 is primarily
due to increased tax benefits from losses of the parent company allocated to
GULF under the joint consolidated income tax agreement between SOUTHERN and its
subsidiaries.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trust. See "Financing
Activities" herein for details relating to the January 1997 issuance by Gulf
Power Capital Trust I of its 7.625% trust preferred securities.

     Dividends on preferred stock. Current quarter and year-to-date preferred
stock dividends decreased when compared to the same periods in 1996 due to
redemptions of preferred stock in March and August of 1997.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a potentially less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the
Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In July 1997, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA")
published revisions to the ambient air quality standards for ozone and
particulate matter, making the standards significantly more stringent. In
addition, in October 1997, EPA issued a proposed rule which, if implemented as
proposed, would require substantial further reductions in NOx emissions from
fossil-fueled generating facilities. Implementation of the above-described
standards and proposed rules would result in increased compliance costs and
capital expenditures for the operating companies in amounts that cannot be
determined at this time.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of "comprehensive
income," which is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in
stockholders' equity, and its components. The standard is effective in 1998. It
is not expected to affect GULF's financial reporting.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related  Information.  Statement No. 131, which  supersedes
Statement  Nos.  14,  18,  24 and 30,  establishes  new  standards  for  segment
reporting,  using the "management  approach," in which  reportable  segments are
based on the same  criteria on which  management  disaggregates  a business  for
making operating decisions and assessing performance.  GULF is in the process of
evaluating Statement No. 131 and its impact and will adopt the standard by 1998.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (G) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first nine months of 1997
included the addition of approximately $32.0 million to utility plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first quarter of 1997, Gulf Power Capital Trust I, a statutory
business trust established for the purpose of holding GULF's junior subordinated
notes and issuing trust preferred securities and common securities, sold $40
million of its 7.625% trust preferred securities which are guaranteed by GULF.
For additional information, see Note (I) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Sources of Capital" of GULF in the Form 10-K. A portion of these proceeds was
used to redeem $5 million of 7.88% cumulative preferred stock, $5 million of
7.52% cumulative preferred stock and $14.5 million of 7.00% cumulative preferred
stock during the first quarter of 1997 and $15 million of 7.30% cumulative
preferred stock in August 1997.

     On July 1, 1997, GULF sold, through public authorities, $40.93 million of
variable rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds due July 1, 2022. The
proceeds were used to redeem $32 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25%
pollution control revenue refunding bonds; $5 million aggregate principal amount
of 6.75% pollution control revenue refunding bonds; and $3.93 million aggregate
principal amount of 6.75% pollution control revenue refunding bonds.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Also, on August 1, 1997, GULF sold $20 million of Series B 7.50% Junior
Subordinated Notes due June 30, 2037. The proceeds were used to pay a portion of
the scheduled maturity of $25 million of 5.875% first mortgage bonds that were
due on August 1, 1997.

     GULF plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.


Capital Requirements

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF
under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and
"Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of GULF's
capital requirements for its construction program, environmental compliance
efforts and maturing debt. GULF's capital requirements for its construction
program for 1997 through 1999 were increased in October 1997 by $43 million
primarily due to production project costs at Plant Daniel and additional costs
related to a new company-owned cogeneration facility being built at an
industrial customer's site. GULF's gross property additions, including those
amounts related to environmental compliance, are now budgeted at $185 million
for 1997 through 1999 ($55 million in 1997, $68 million in 1998, and $62 million
in 1999). Approximately $55.8 million will be required through September 30,
1998, for maturities of long-term debt.


Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
GULF expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any anticipated
security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at September 30,
1997, approximately $5.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $103.4 million
of unused committed lines of credit with banks (including $61.9 million
liquidity support for variable rate pollution control bonds). At September 30,
1997, GULF had no outstanding short-term notes payable to banks. Since GULF has
no major generating plants under construction, management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third
quarter and year-to-date 1997 was $25.2 million and $48.4 million, respectively,
compared to $21.8 million and $44.9 million for the corresponding periods of
1996. Earnings for the current quarter increased by 15.5% primarily as a result
of increased operating revenues.
Year-to-date earnings increased 7.9% due primarily to lower operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

</TABLE>

     Revenues. The increase in revenues for the third quarter was primarily due
to increased energy sales to retail customers. Energy sales increased 1.9%, 5.4%
and 2.1% to residential, commercial and industrial customers, respectively. The
revenue increases associated with these sales were 6.6%, 7.4% and 5.3%. Retail
revenues, excluding those revenues which represent the recovery of fuel expense
and certain other expenses and do not affect income, increased $3.0 million for
the quarter due to increased energy sales and decreased $1.4 million for
year-to-date 1997 primarily due to milder temperatures experienced during this
period as compared to 1996. Third quarter and year-to-date revenues from
territorial wholesale customers, excluding fuel revenues which do not affect
income, increased $4.5 million and decreased $1.1 million, respectively,
compared to the same periods of 1996, with a increase in energy sales of 8.1%
and 0.7%, respectively.

     Revenues from affiliates. Revenues from sales to affiliated companies
within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. In
addition, the third quarter and year-to-date 1997 periods reflect adjustments in
affiliated billings. These transactions do not have a significant impact on
earnings.

     Fuel expense. The increases in fuel expense was due to increased generation
resulting from a rise in retail and territorial wholesale energy sales.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power from non-affiliates. Purchased power from non-affiliates
decreased in both the current quarter and year-to-date when compared to the same
periods in 1996 due to MISSISSIPPI's purchase during the third quarter 1996 of
capacity and energy from another utility.

     Other operation expense. The current quarter increase in other operation
expense was primarily due to higher administrative and general expenses. The
year-to-date decrease can be primarily attributed to lower administrative and
general expenses in 1997.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment. Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in rates under
the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force on electric
rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking place. MISSISSIPPI's 1997
annual filing under the ECO Plan with the Mississippi PSC resulted in an
approved annual revenue requirement increase of $0.9 million, effective April
1997.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     The Mississippi PSC has initiated a docket to study retail access in order
to determine a position on electric deregulation which best serves the 
State.  Hearings have been and will continue to be held in which interested
parties including MISSISSIPPI are participating.  The Public Utilities Staff of
the Mississippi PSC has issued without recommendation a proposed deregulation
plan for comment from interested parties and to form a basis for future 
hearings of the Mississippi PSC.  No conclusion by the Mississippi PSC is 
anticipated during this year.  Further hearings will be held in 1998.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     In July 1997, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA")
published revisions to the ambient air quality standards for ozone and
particulate matter, making the standards significantly more stringent. In
addition, in October 1997, EPA issued a proposed rule which, if implemented as
proposed, would require substantial further reductions in NOx emissions from
fossil-fueled generating facilities. Implementation of the above-described
standards and proposed rules would result in increased compliance costs and
capital expenditures for the operating companies in amounts that cannot be
determined at this time.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of "comprehensive
income," which is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in
stockholders' equity, and its components. The standard is effective in 1998. It
is not expected to affect MISSISSIPPI's financial reporting.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related  Information.  Statement No. 131, which  supersedes
Statement  Nos.  14,  18,  24 and 30,  establishes  new  standards  for  segment
reporting,  using the "management  approach," in which  reportable  segments are
based on the same  criteria on which  management  disaggregates  a business  for
making  operating  decisions and assessing  performance.  MISSISSIPPI  is in the
process  of  evaluating  Statement  No.  131 and its  impact  and will adopt the
standard by 1998.

     One hundred employees of MISSISSIPPI, in certain areas, including finance,
environmental quality and external affairs, have accepted a workforce reduction
plan. This voluntary plan was an effort to find appropriate ways to reduce fixed
costs, while at the same time providing employees with choices about their
future. The total cost to be incurred in connection with this voluntary plan is
expected to be within the range of $16 million to $19 million and will be
deferred and amortized, pending regulatory approval. See Note (H) in the "Notes
to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (G) and (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential. Reference is also made to
Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first nine months
of 1997 included the addition of approximately $38.5 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first quarter of 1997, Mississippi Power Capital Trust I, a statutory
business trust established for the purpose of holding MISSISSIPPI's junior
subordinated notes and issuing trust preferred securities and common securities,
sold $35 million of its 7.75% trust originated preferred securities which are
guaranteed by MISSISSIPPI. For additional information, see Note (I) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Sources of Capital" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of
MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its construction program, environmental
compliance efforts, sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

                            MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     MISSISSIPPI has applied for a certificate of public convenience and
necessity to the Mississippi PSC to build up to 1,000 MW of natural gas-fired
combined cycle generation at Plant Daniel. The estimated capital cost associated
with construction of this additional generation at Plant Daniel is approximately
$450 million. MISSISSIPPI would own two-thirds of the new generation, with an
affiliate owning the other one-third. This two-thirds share results in an
estimated capital cost of approximately $300 million. Hearings on MISSISSIPPI's
certificate request are expected in November 1997.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
MISSISSIPPI expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any
anticipated security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS -
"Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at
September 30, 1997, approximately $8.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $76.3 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks
(including $10.8 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made
only to fund purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control
bonds). At September 30, 1997, MISSISSIPPI had no short-term borrowings
outstanding. Since MISSISSIPPI has no major generating plants under
construction, management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter
and year-to-date 1997 was $14.3 million and $22.0 million, respectively, as
compared to $12.8 million and $21.4 million for the corresponding periods of
1996. For the quarter, earnings increased 11.4% due to increased operating
revenues during this period. Year-to-date earnings increased 2.5% primarily as a
result of lower interest charges and an increase in other income during this
period.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses and do not affect income, revenues increased $4.3 million for the
quarter and increased $1.4 million year-to-date when compared to the same
periods of 1996. Revenues for the current quarter of 1997 were up primarily
because of increased energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial
customers. Energy sales to these customers increased 3.7%, 5.4% and 14.7%,
respectively, resulting in revenue increases of 4.4%, 6.9% and 11.8%,
respectively. Year-to-date revenues for 1997 increased primarily because of a
$0.5 million increase in other operating revenues and a $1.0 million increase in
revenues from non-affiliates. Retail revenues, excluding fuel revenues were down
slightly primarily because of a 5.5% decrease in energy sales to residential
customers offset somewhat by increased energy sales of 1.0% in the commercial
sector and 3.5% in the industrial sector. Energy sales to residential customers
were impacted by the milder-than-normal temperatures experienced during 1997.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. In addition, the
year-to-date 1997 reflects an adjustment in affiliated billings. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expenses. The increases for the quarter and year-to-date can be
attributed to higher generation.

     Other operation expense. The current quarter and year-to-date increases
when compared to the same periods in 1996 are due primarily to higher
administrative and general expense due to expenses associated with the voluntary
severance plan during this quarter.

     Income taxes applicable to other income. The increases in this item for the
quarter and year-to-date can be attributed to increased tax benefits from losses
of the parent company allocated to SAVANNAH under the joint consolidated income
tax agreement between SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH
in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     In July 1997, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA")
published revisions to the ambient air quality standards for ozone and
particulate matter, making the standards significantly more stringent. In
addition, in October 1997, EPA issued a proposed rule which, if implemented as
proposed, would require substantial further reductions in NOx emissions from
fossil-fueled generating facilities. Implementation of the above-described
standards and proposed rules would result in increased compliance costs and
capital expenditures for the operating companies in amounts that cannot be
determined at this time.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of "comprehensive
income," which is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in
stockholders' equity, and its components. The standard is effective in 1998. It
is not expected to affect SAVANNAH's financial reporting.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related  Information.  Statement No. 131, which  supersedes
Statement  Nos.  14,  18,  24 and 30,  establishes  new  standards  for  segment
reporting,  using the "management  approach," in which  reportable  segments are
based on the same  criteria on which  management  disaggregates  a business  for
making operating decisions and assessing performance. SAVANNAH is in the process
of  evaluating  Statement  No. 131 and its impact and will adopt the standard by
1998.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (Q) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first nine months of
1997 included the addition of approximately $14.9 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See SAVANNAH's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

In April 1997, SAVANNAH sold, through a public authority, $13.87 million of
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds due 2037. The proceeds were
applied to the redemption in May 1997 of $13.87 million of 6 3/4% pollution
control revenue bonds.

     SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
SAVANNAH expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any anticipated
security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at September
30, 1997, approximately $10.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $40.5 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. At
September 30, 1997, SAVANNAH had no short-term notes payable to banks. Since
SAVANNAH has no major generating plants under construction, management believes
that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of
credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)  The condensed financial  statements of the registrants included herein have
     been prepared by each registrant,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and
     regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of each registrant's management, the
     information   regarding  such  registrant  furnished  herein  reflects  all
     adjustments (which included only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to
     present  fairly the results for the periods  ended  September  30, 1997 and
     1996.  Certain  information and footnote  disclosures  normally included in
     financial   statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
     accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules
     and  regulations,  although each  registrant  believes that the disclosures
     regarding such  registrant are adequate to make the  information  presented
     not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed financial  statements
     be read in conjunction with the financial  statements and the notes thereto
     included in each  registrant's  latest annual report on Form 10-K.  Certain
     prior-period  amounts have been reclassified to conform with current-period
     presentation.  

     The  condensed  financial  statements of ALABAMA and GEORGIA
     included  herein have been reviewed by ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's  independent
     public accountants as set forth in their reports included herein as Exhibit
     1 to ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)   SOUTHERN's operating affiliates are subject to the provisions of FASB
      Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
      Regulation. In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no
      longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
      off related unrecoverable regulatory assets and liabilities, and determine
      if any other assets have been impaired. For additional information, see
      Note 1 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the
      Form 10-K.

(C)   The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
      practices of the electric utility industry--including
      SOUTHERN's--regarding the recognition, measurement and classification of
      decommissioning costs for nuclear generating facilities in the financial
      statements. In response to these questions, the FASB has decided to review
      the accounting for liabilities related to closure and removal of
      long-lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
      SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial
      statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA under "Depreciation and
      Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)   SOUTHERN engages in price risk management activities for trading and
      non-trading purposes. Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial
      statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a discussion of
      these activities. Activities for non-trading purposes consist of
      transactions that are employed to mitigate SOUTHERN's risk related to
      interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. At September 30, 1997,
      the status of outstanding non-trading related derivative contracts was as
      follows:

       Net unrealized gains and losses on outstanding positions with respect to
       trading activities were not material at September 30, 1997.

(E)   On January 29, 1997, Southern Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
      SOUTHERN, completed the acquisition of an 80% interest in CEPA for a total
      net investment of approximately $2.0 billion. On August 13, 1997, an
      additional 19.99% interest was acquired for $150 million plus an interest
      in a project under development. (Reference is made to the Current Report
      on Form 8-K of SOUTHERN dated October 9, 1996 for a more detailed
      description of the acquisition. In addition, reference is also made to
      "Management's Discussion and Analysis - Future Earnings Potential" of
      SOUTHERN herein for more information relating to the acquisition in August
      1997 by Southern Energy of an additional 19.99% interest in CEPA.)

         The acquisition of CEPA was accounted for as a purchase with the $1.6
      billion excess of the acquisition cost over the preliminary estimate of
      the fair value of CEPA's net assets being assigned to goodwill. The
      allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and may be revised at a
      later date. Goodwill will be amortized on a straight-line basis over 40
      years. Results of operations of CEPA are included in the condensed
      consolidated financial statements subsequent to January 29, 1997.

         The following unaudited pro forma combined results of operations for
      the three months ended September 30, 1997 and 1996 and the nine months
      ended September 30, 1997 and 1996 have been prepared assuming the
      acquisition of CEPA had occurred at the beginning of each period. The pro
      forma results assume acquisition financing of $916 million of short-term
      borrowings, $792 million of long-term notes and $400 million of capital
      securities and SOUTHERN's assumed effective composite interest rate on
      these obligations for each period presented was 6.62%. Eventually, the
      existing borrowing may be replaced by some other combination of long-term
      debt and equity.

         The pro forma results are provided for information only. The results
      are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that would have been
      realized had the acquisition occurred on the indicated dates, nor are they

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(J)   In June 1995, the Alabama PSC issued a rate order granting ALABAMA's
      request for gradual adjustments to move toward parity among customer
      classes. This order also calls for a moratorium on any periodic retail
      rate increases (but not decreases) until July 2001. In December 1995, the
      Alabama PSC issued an order authorizing ALABAMA to reduce balance sheet
      items--such as plant and deferred charges--at any time ALABAMA's actual
      base rate revenues exceed the budgeted revenues. Reference is made to Note
      3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the
      Form 10-K for additional information. In April 1997, the Alabama PSC
      issued an additional order authorizing ALABAMA to reduce balance sheet
      asset items. This order authorizes the reduction of such items up to an
      amount equal to 5 times the total estimated annual revenue reduction
      resulting from future rate reductions.

(K)   In 1996, legal actions against ALABAMA were filed in several counties in
      Alabama charging ALABAMA with fraud and non-compliance with regulatory
      statutes relating to the offer, sale and financing of "extended service
      contracts" in connection with the sale of electric appliances. See Note 3
      to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for additional information.

(L)  In February 1996, the Georgia PSC approved a three-year  accounting  order,
     effective January 1, 1996. In November 1996, on appeal by a consumer group,
     the Superior Court of Fulton County,  Georgia reversed the accounting order
     and remanded the matter to the Georgia  PSC. In October  1997,  the Georgia
     Court of Appeals  upheld the  accounting  order and  reversed  the Superior
     Court's  decision.  GEORGIA  continued to recognize  expenses in accordance
     with the  accounting  order  while it was under  appeal.  Under the  order,
     earnings in excess of a 12.5% retail  return on common  equity will be used
     to accelerate the  amortization  of regulatory  assets or  depreciation  of
     electric  plant.  Accordingly,  for earnings in excess of the 12.5% return,
     GEORGIA recorded charges of $76.7 million and $104.9 million, respectively,
     for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 1997 (presented in
     the accompanying  financial  statements as depreciation expense of electric
     plant and as an addition to the reserve for  depreciation).  For additional
     information,  reference is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of
     SOUTHERN and GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(M)   In 1987 and 1989, the Georgia PSC ordered that the allowed costs of Plant
      Vogtle, a two-unit nuclear facility of which GEORGIA owns 45.7%, be phased
      into rates. Pursuant to the orders, GEORGIA recorded a deferred return
      under phase-in plans until October 1991 when the allowed investment was
      fully reflected in rates. In 1991, the Georgia PSC levelized the remaining
      Plant Vogtle declining capacity buyback expenses over a six-year period.
      In addition, GEORGIA deferred certain Plant Vogtle operating expenses and
      financing costs under accounting orders issued by the Georgia PSC. These
      Georgia PSC orders provide for the recovery of deferred costs within 10
      years. The unamortized balance of these deferred costs at September 30,
      1997, was $58.2 million.

(N)  Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information  concerning the recovery
     by GEORGIA of its costs  associated  with the Rocky Mountain pumped storage
     hydroelectric plant. At September 30, 1997, GEORGIA's net investment in the
     plant was  approximately  $163  million.  In August 1997,  the staff of the
     Georgia PSC issued a report regarding its prudence review of the plant. The
     report recommends that of GEORGIA's initial $202 million  investment in the
     plant,   approximately  $79  million  be  allowed  in  rate  base,  with  a
     disallowance of approximately $123 million.  The report also concludes that
     GEORGIA  should be allowed to retain the benefits of the plant's lower fuel
     costs (as compared to alternative sources of generation). The report states
     that as an alternative,  it may be reasonable to provide a larger allowance
     in rate  base and  allow  customers  to  receive  the  benefit  of the fuel
     savings. GEORGIA estimates the present value of the fuel benefits over the

                                       69

      life of the plant to be in the range of approximately $50 million to $70
      million. The Georgia PSC intends to conclude hearings on this matter in
      December 1997, at which time the Georgia PSC will take the matter under
      advisement for future action. While GEORGIA disagrees with the Georgia PSC
      staff's conclusions, the outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

(O)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item
      8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to an agreement reached
      January 10, 1997, between GEORGIA and MEAG relating to a new power supply
      relationship. A power supply contract entered into between GEORGIA and
      MEAG has been approved by FERC and was implemented in August 1997.

(P)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
      designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
      Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
      environmental contingencies.

(Q)   On November 7, 1997, SAVANNAH filed with the Georgia PSC to request
      an accounting order to make certain accounting adjustments including
      implementation of new depreciation rates, to increase the provision in the
      storm damage reserve, and to provide a process to address SAVANNAH's level
      of earnings in the future. On November 10, 1997, SAVANNAH filed for a rate
      reduction, of approximately $1.0 million, targeted to the small business
      class.

(R)   In July 1997, the new Labor government in the United Kingdom introduced
      its first budget which became effective July 31, 1997. This budget
      included a one-time windfall profit tax on privatized utilities. As
      reflected in the "Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income", the effect
      of this tax, approximately (pound)90 million ($148 million), was recorded
      in the quarter ended September 30, 1997. The tax is payable in two equal
      installments on or before December 1, 1997 and December 1, 1998.

                 (1)    Reference is made to the Notes to the Condensed

                        certain legal and administrative proceedings in which
                        SOUTHERN and its reporting subsidiaries are involved.

                        Form 10-K for information regarding a tax deficiency
                        notice issued by the Internal Revenue Service claiming
                        that GEORGIA and SOUTHERN owed additional taxes for the
                        years 1984 through 1987 and regarding GEORGIA's and
                        SOUTHERN's claims for tax refunds for such years.

                        In August 1997, SOUTHERN and the Internal Revenue
                        Service entered into a settlement agreement which is
                        subject to the review and approval of the Joint
                        Congressional Committee on Taxation. If approved by the
                        Joint Committee, the agreement would resolve all issues
                        in the case for the years before the Tax Court,
                        resulting in a refund to SOUTHERN in an amount which is
                        not expected to have a material effect on earnings.
                        There can be no assurance that such Joint Committee
                        approval will be received.


                 (3)    ALABAMA, GEORGIA and MISSISSIPPI, et al. v. TVA
                        (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of 
                        Alabama)

                        On July 24, 1997, ALABAMA, GEORGIA, MISSISSIPPI and
                        other plaintiffs entered into an agreement with TVA that
                        will settle the action filed in April 1997, which sought
                        to enjoin TVA from violating a 1959 act that prohibits
                        TVA from selling power outside the area that was being
                        served by it in 1957. In the settlement agreement, TVA
                        agrees that it will enter into exchange power
                        arrangements only with authorized entities to which it
                        may lawfully sell such power under the 1959 act, and
                        that it will not knowingly engage in such transactions
                        where the authorized entity is reselling that power to
                        unauthorized entities.


Item 5.          Other Information.

                 On November 3, 1997, SOUTHERN commenced offers to purchase for
                 cash (the "Offers") certain series of the preferred stocks of
                 ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF and MISSISSIPPI. The Offers are being
                 made for one series ($36.4 million aggregate par value) in the
                 case of ALABAMA, nine series ($95.8 million aggregate stated
                 value) in the case of GEORGIA, five series ($50.1 million
                 aggregate par value or stated capital) in the case of GULF and
                 three series ($11.0 million aggregate par value) in the case of
                 MISSISSIPPI.

                        SOUTHERN will sell any shares purchased by it pursuant
                 to the Offers to the respective subsidiary companies at the
                 purchase price paid by SOUTHERN plus expenses, and the
                 respective subsidiary companies will thereupon retire and
                 cancel such shares.

                        Concurrently with the Offers, the subsidiary companies
                 are soliciting proxies on behalf of their respective boards of
                 directors in connection with special meetings of stockholders
                 scheduled to be held on December 10, 1997. The purpose of the
                 special meetings is to consider a proposed
