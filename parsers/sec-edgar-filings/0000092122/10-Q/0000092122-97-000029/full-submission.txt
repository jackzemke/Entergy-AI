                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   FIRST QUARTER 1997 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1996


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



Earnings

SOUTHERN's consolidated net income for the first quarter of 1997 was $187 
million ($0.28 per share), compared to $233 million ($0.35 per share) for the
corresponding period of 1996, representing a 19.7% decrease. Milder weather in
the service territories of the operating affiliates during the current quarter,
compared with the corresponding quarter of 1996, was the primary reason for this
reduction in earnings. In addition, the acquisition of CEPA also had a slightly
negative effect, which was anticipated. (Reference is made to "Future Earnings
Potential" below for additional information relating to the acquisition, in
January 1997, of CEPA.)

       SOUTHERN's traditional core business is primarily represented by its five
domestic electric utility operating companies, which provide electric service in
four Southeastern states. Another significant portion of SOUTHERN's business is
its non-traditional business primarily represented by Southern Energy, which
owns and manages international and domestic businesses for SOUTHERN. Businesses
acquired by Southern Energy have been included in the consolidated statements of
income since the date of acquisition. Certain changes in operating revenues and
expenses from the prior period are the result of such acquisitions.

Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

     Operating revenues. Operating revenues for the first quarter of 1997 when
compared to the corresponding quarter of 1996 decreased by $81 million (4.1%)
for the traditional core business while operating revenues were up by $236
million (55.1%) for the non-traditional business. The primary factor
contributing to this decrease in traditional core revenues was milder weather
during the current period which resulted in a lower demand for electricity. The
effect of weather on first quarter results is evidenced by the fact that
residential energy sales were down by 9.7% when compared to the corresponding
quarter of 1996. In addition, although energy sales for commercial and
industrial customers were up by 0.3% and 2.9%, respectively, revenues, in both
cases, were down primarily due to rate reductions to certain large customers.
The increase in operating revenues for the non-traditional business was
primarily attributable to increased sales by Southern Energy's power marketing
organization and to CEPA, which was acquired in late January 1997.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     Purchased power expense. Purchased power expense for the traditional core
business declined by $17 million for the first quarter of 1997, compared to the
comparable period of 1996, primarily because of milder-than-normal weather.
Purchased power expense attributable to Southern Energy-related activities
increased by $204 million primarily due to purchases in connection with its
power marketing activities.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization
expense for the traditional core business increased by $28 million for the
current quarter as compared to the corresponding quarter of 1996 primarily due
to additions to utility plant and a charge of $19.8 million pursuant to
GEORGIA's retail accounting order as discussed in Note (L) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein. For the non-traditional business,
depreciation and amortization increased by $17 million primarily because of the
acquisition of CEPA.

     Taxes other than income taxes.  Taxes other than income taxes for the firs
quarter of 1997 when compared to the corresponding quarter of 1996 decreased
primarily due to a $15 million reduction attributable to SWEB. This decrease 
resulted from the lowering, in November 1996, of the taxes on electricity sales
from 10% to 3.7%.

     Interest income. This increase for the current quarter as compared to the
corresponding quarter of 1996, is primarily attributable to $8 million in
interest income from investment of funds provided to Southern Energy prior to
closing of the CEPA acquisition.

     Interest on long-term debt.  Interest on long-term debt for the operating
companies decreased by $7 million for the current quarter as compared to the 
comparable quarter of 1996, reflecting the refinancing efforts of such
companies. However, increases attributable to non-traditional business 
activities, primarily CEPA, resulted in a net increase in such interest for the
current quarter.

     Distributions  on preferred and capital  securities of  subsidiaries.  This
increase  resulted from the sales of securities in 1996 and the first quarter of
1997. See Note (I) in the "Notes to the Condensed  Financial  Statements" herein
for additional information.

     Minority interest. The increase in minority interest for the current
quarter as compared to the corresponding quarter of 1996 is primarily
attributable to the sale in July 1996 of a 25% share of SWEB and to the
acquisition of an 80% controlling interest in CEPA.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment, with non-traditional business becoming more significant. (For
additional information relating to non-traditional business activities,
including information relating to the acquisition in January 1997 of an 80%
interest in CEPA, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "New Business Development" in the Form
10-K.)

     In May 1997, SOUTHERN announced that, through Southern Energy, it had
agreed to purchase 25% of the outstanding common stock of Berliner Kraft und
Licht AG (Bewag), the vertically integrated electric utility that serves Berlin,
Germany, for approximately $830 million. The purchase is subject to approval by
Berlin's parliament and European regulators.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     In February, 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share.
The standard simplifies the computation of earnings per share (EPS) required by
existing rules. SOUTHERN will adopt this standard on December 31, 1997. If EPS
amounts were computed as specified by Statement No. 128, basic EPS and diluted
EPS would be equal, and would equal the amounts currently reported in the
"Condensed Statements of Income".

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (D), (G), (J), (K), (L), (M), (N) and
(P) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion
of various contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings
potential. Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings"
herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first three months of
1997 included the addition of approximately $378 million to utility plant and
the acquisition of CEPA. The funds for these additions and other capital
requirements were derived primarily from operations and sales of securities. See
SOUTHERN's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first three months of 1997, retirements of the operating companies'
first mortgage bonds totaled $80 million and redemptions of preferred stock
totaled $204 million. Subsidiaries of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF and
MISSISSIPPI have formed statutory business trusts which sold, during the first
quarter of 1997, an aggregate of $932 million of trust preferred or capital
securities. See Note (I) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements"
herein for further details.

     During the first three months of 1997, SOUTHERN raised $89 million from the
issuance of new common stock under SOUTHERN's various stock plans. The market
price of SOUTHERN's common stock at March 31, 1997 was $21.125 per share and the
book value was $13.60 per share, representing a market-to-book ratio of 155%,
compared to $22.625, $13.61 and 166%, respectively, at the end of 1996. The
dividend for the first quarter of 1997 was $0.325 per share.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of SOUTHERN
under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and
"Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern
electric system's capital requirements for its construction program,
environmental compliance efforts, sinking fund requirements and maturing debt.
Approximately $583 million will be required by March 31, 1998, for present
sinking fund requirements, redemption of preferred stock and redemptions and
maturities of long-term debt. Also, the operating companies plan to continue, to
the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock
and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 1997, as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
Currently, each of the operating companies expects to have adequate earnings
coverage ratios for any anticipated security sales through at least 1999. See
Item 1 BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
March 31, 1997, approximately $550 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $4,127 million of unused credit arrangements with banks (including
$829 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made only to
fund purchase obligations of the operating companies relating to variable rate
pollution control bonds). At March 31, 1997, the system companies had
outstanding approximately $286 million of short-term notes payable and $1.7
billion of commercial paper. Since SOUTHERN's construction program with respect
to major generating projects in the traditional core business has been
completed, management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

     See Note (D) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for discussion of financial derivative contracts entered into by SOUTHERN.

1997 was $57.8 million, compared to $73.2 million for the corresponding period
of 1996. This 21.0% decrease in earnings was primarily due to milder weather and
a decrease in commercial and industrial prices.

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses and do not affect net income, revenues for the first quarter 1997
decreased $16.1 million, compared to the corresponding period of 1996. The
decrease in first quarter 1997 revenues reflects a decrease in the amount of
retail, particularly residential, energy sold as well as rate reductions
initiated by ALABAMA for certain commercial and industrial customers. Milder
weather during the current quarter of 1997 as compared to the corresponding
quarter of 1996 primarily impacted residential energy sales, which were down
9.5%. Commercial energy sales and industrial energy sales increased 3.0% and
2.6%, respectively, for the first quarter compared to 1996. Total retail
kilowatt-hour sales for the quarter were down 1.3% compared to the same period
of 1996.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand, the
availability, and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Maintenance expense. Maintenance expense increased for the first quarter of
1997 compared to the same period of 1996 primarily due to an increase in the
accrual of estimated maintenance expenses related to nuclear refueling outages.

     Depreciation and amortization. The increase in depreciation and
amortization for the first quarter of 1997 as compared to the corresponding
period of 1996 was primarily due to additions to utility plant and an increase
in depreciation rates.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. The change in
this item resulted primarily from the issuance of mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities. For additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital Structure" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in
the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (G), (H), (J) and (K) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first three months of
1997 included the addition of approximately $94.6 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Financing Activities

During the first quarter of 1997, redemptions of first mortgage bonds of ALABAMA
totaled $19.8 million. Also, Alabama Power Capital Trust II, a statutory
business trust established for the purpose of holding ALABAMA's junior
subordinated notes and issuing trust preferred securities and common securities,
sold $200.0 million of its 7.60% trust originated preferred securities which are
guaranteed by ALABAMA. A portion of these proceeds was used to redeem $100
million of cumulative preferred stock in February 1997. For additional
information, see Note (I) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements"
and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital Structure" of
ALABAMA in the Form 10-K. In addition, ALABAMA has announced its plans to redeem
an aggregate of $62 million of preferred stock in June and July of 1997.

     ALABAMA will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and
replace these securities with lower-cost capital, if market conditions permit.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of ALABAMA
under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital requirements
for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental compliance
efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
ALABAMA expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any anticipated
security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at March 31,
1997, approximately $5.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and had unused
committed lines of credit of approximately $815 million (including $208 million
of such lines under which borrowings may be made only to fund purchase
obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds) with regulatory
authority for up to $750 million of short-term borrowings. At March 31, 1997,
ALABAMA had outstanding $413.8 million of commercial paper. Since ALABAMA has no
major traditional generating plants under construction, management believes that
the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit
without maintaining large cash balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of March 31, 1997, and the related condensed statements of income and
cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 1997 and 1996. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1996
(not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 12, 1997, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1996 is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1997 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1996


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter of
1997 was $106.0 million compared to $114.4 million for the corresponding period
of 1996. Earnings decreased by 7.3% primarily as a result of decreased revenues
due to milder weather experienced during the current quarter.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
 following:

</TABLE>

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses and do not affect income, revenues for the first quarter decreased
$31.0 million compared to the corresponding period of 1996. The decrease in
revenues is primarily due to a 9.7% decrease in residential kilowatt-hour sales
resulting from milder-than-normal weather. Retail revenues, excluding fuel
revenues, decreased 4.7% or $33.0 million for the current quarter as compared to
the corresponding quarter of 1996.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The decrease in purchased power from
non-affiliates compared to the corresponding period of 1996 is primarily due to
a decrease in energy purchases resulting from milder-than-normal weather.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Provision for separation benefits. The decrease in provision for separation
benefits is attributable to work force reduction programs charged to this
provision in the first quarter of 1996, which have been implemented to control
growth in future operating expenses.

     Other operation expense. The decrease in other operation expense for the
current quarter is primarily due to lower administrative and general expenses
compared to the same period of 1996.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in depreciation and
amortization for the current quarter compared to the same period of 1996 is
primarily due to a charge of $19.8 million pursuant to the retail accounting
order. See Note (L) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for further details.

     Interest on long-term debt and Dividends on preferred stock. These declines
reflect the redemption and refinancing of long-term debt and preferred stock.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary companies. The change
in this item resulted primarily from the issuance of additional mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities in August 1996 and January 1997. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Financing
Activities" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in
the Form 10-K.

     Effective January 1, 1996, GEORGIA began operating under a three-year
retail accounting order. Under the order, GEORGIA's earnings are evaluated
against a retail return on common equity range of 10% to 12.5%. GEORGIA is
required to absorb cost increases of approximately $29.0 million annually during
the order's three-year operation, including $14.0 million annually of
accelerated depreciation of electric plant. Reference is made to Note (L) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (G) and (L) through (P) in the "Notes
to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first three months of
1997 included the addition of approximately $103 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

During the first quarter of 1997, maturities and redemptions of first mortgage
bonds and preferred stock by GEORGIA totaled $139 million. In January 1997,
Georgia Power Capital Trust II, a statutory business trust established for the
purpose of holding GEORGIA's junior subordinated notes and issuing trust
preferred securities and common securities, sold $175.0 million of its 7.60%
trust preferred securities, which are guaranteed by GEORGIA. (See Note (I) in
the " Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Financing Activities" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K for
further details.) In April 1997, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, $90.0
million of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds due 2032. The proceeds
will be applied to the redemption on July 1, 1997 of $90.0 million outstanding
principal amount of 8.375% pollution control revenue bonds.

     GEORGIA plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Issues" in the
Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital requirements for its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
GEORGIA expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any anticipated
security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at March 31,
1997, approximately $31.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$854.7 million of unused credit arrangements with banks (including $589.7
million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made only to fund
purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds). At
March 31, 1997, GEORGIA had outstanding $58.4 million of short-term notes
payable to banks and $203.4 million of commercial paper. Since GEORGIA has no
major generating plants under construction, management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of March 31, 1997, and the related condensed
statements of income and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31,
1997 and 1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1996
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 12, 1997, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1996, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                    FIRST QUARTER 1997 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1996


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter of
1997 was $10.7 million, compared to $11.3 million for the corresponding period
of 1996. Earnings decreased by 4.6% primarily due to lower revenues as a result
of milder temperatures.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the 
following:

</TABLE>

     Revenues. Excluding fuel and other revenues which represent the
pass-through of fuel expense and certain other expenses and do not affect net
income, revenues for the first quarter decreased $6.1 million, compared to the
corresponding period of 1996. The decrease in revenues for the current period
was influenced most heavily by a 5.4% decrease in retail kilowatt-hour sales
compared to the same period of 1996. This change in retail energy sales is
primarily due to lower residential sales as a result of milder weather during
the current quarter as compared to the previous year offset somewhat by an
increase in the number of customers served. Industrial revenues were down for
the current quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to increased
participation in the Real-Time-Pricing program. See Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K
for information on initiatives to remain competitive and to meet conservation
goals set by the Florida PSC.

     Purchased power from affiliates. Purchased power from affiliates for the
first quarter compared to the corresponding period of 1996 was lower due to
maintenance outages at Plant Crist and Plant Daniel during the first half of
1996. Purchased power transactions among the affiliated companies within the
Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on demand and
the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operation expense. Other operation expense increased primarily due to
an increase in amortization costs related to the buyout and renegotiation of a
coal supply contract and costs associated with work force reduction programs.
For additional information regarding work force reduction programs, see Note (H)
in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Maintenance expense. The decrease in maintenance expense for the current
quarter is primarily due to the scheduled maintenance on production facilities
which occurred in the first quarter of 1996 at Plant Crist and Plant Daniel.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a potentially less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the
Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (G) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first three months of
1997 included the addition of approximately $11.1 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

On January 31, 1997, Gulf Power Capital Trust I, a statutory business trust
established for the purpose of holding GULF's junior subordinated notes and
issuing trust preferred securities and common securities, sold $40 million of
its 7.625% trust preferred securities which are guaranteed by GULF. For
additional information, see Note (I) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Sources of
Capital" of GULF in the Form 10-K. A portion of these proceeds was used to
redeem $5 million of 7.88% cumulative preferred stock, $5 million of 7.52%
cumulative preferred stock and $14.5 million of 7.00% cumulative preferred
stock.

     GULF plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and "Other
Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of GULF's capital
requirements for its construction program, environmental compliance efforts and
maturing debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
GULF expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any anticipated
security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at March 31,
1997, approximately $3.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $66.8 million
of unused committed lines of credit with banks (including $20.3 million
liquidity support for variable rate pollution control bonds). At March 31, 1997,
GULF had outstanding $17.5 million of short-term notes payable to banks. Since
GULF has no major generating plants under construction, management believes that
the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit
without maintaining large cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first
quarter of 1997 was $10.6 million compared to $11.7 million for the
corresponding period of 1996. The 9.0% decrease in earnings was primarily due to
a decrease in revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the 
following:

</TABLE>

     Revenues. The decrease in revenues for the current quarter as compared to
the corresponding period of 1996 was influenced by a 1.3% decrease in the amount
of retail energy sold. For the current quarter, residential energy sales
decreased 7.1% while commercial and industrial energy sales increased by 1.2%
and 0.5%, respectively, as compared to the same period of 1996. Retail revenues,
excluding those revenues which represent the recovery of fuel expense and
certain other expenses and do not affect income, decreased $3.6 million
primarily due to milder weather experienced during the current quarter as
compared to 1996, offset somewhat by a slight increase in the number of
customers. For the current quarter, sales to territorial wholesale customers
were lower than in 1996. First quarter revenues from territorial wholesale
customers, excluding fuel revenues which do not affect income, decreased $1.6
million compared to the same period of 1996, with a decrease in energy sales of
3.5%.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. In addition, the
first quarter of 1997 reflects an adjustment in affiliated billings. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operation expense. The decrease in other operation expense for the
current quarter as compared to the corresponding quarter of 1996 is primarily
due to lower administrative and general expenses.

     Maintenance expense. The decrease in maintenance expense for the current
quarter is primarily attributable to scheduled maintenance performed at Plant
Daniel during the first quarter of 1996.

     Interest on long-term debt. The decline in interest on long-term debt
reflects the redemption and refinancing of long-term debt.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment. Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in rates under
the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force on electric
rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking place. MISSISSIPPI's 1997
annual filing under the ECO Plan with the Mississippi PSC resulted in an
approved annual revenue requirement increase of $0.9 million, effective April
1997.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (G) and (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential. Reference is also made to
Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first three months
of 1997 included the addition of approximately $11.4 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations and an increase in short-term debt. See MISSISSIPPI's
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

On February 26, 1997, Mississippi Power Capital Trust I, a statutory business
trust established for the purpose of holding MISSISSIPPI's junior subordinated
notes and issuing trust preferred securities and common securities, sold $35
million of its 7.75% trust originated preferred securities which are guaranteed
by MISSISSIPPI. For additional information, see Note (I) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Sources of Capital" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of
MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its construction program, environmental
compliance efforts, sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
MISSISSIPPI expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any
anticipated security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS -
"Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at March
31, 1997, approximately $16.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $76.3 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks
(including $10.8 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made
only to fund purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control
bonds). At March 31, 1997, MISSISSIPPI had no short-term borrowings outstanding.
Since MISSISSIPPI has no major generating plants under construction, management
believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing
lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1997 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1996


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter
of 1997 was $2.5 million compared to $2.7 million for the corresponding period
of 1996. The 7.1% decrease in earnings was primarily due to a decrease in
revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                                Increase (Decrease)
                                                     (in thousands)       %
<S>                                                     <C>            <C>
Revenues.......................................         $ (6,480)      (13.1)
Revenues from affiliates.......................           (1,150)      (95.2)
Purchased power from affiliates................           (6,568)      (41.4)
</TABLE>

         Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of
fuel expenses and do not affect income, revenues for the quarter decreased
approximately $647 thousand, compared to the corresponding period of 1996. The
decrease in revenues was due primarily to an 8.2% decrease in the amount of
residential energy sold. Retail revenues, excluding fuel revenues, decreased
approximately $650 thousand. This decrease in revenues was primarily a result of
milder-than-normal weather during the current quarter offset somewhat by an
increase in the number of customers served and an increase in energy
requirements to the industrial sector.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. In addition, the
first quarter of 1997 reflects an adjustment in affiliated billings. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH
in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (Q) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first three months of
1997 included the addition of approximately $4.6 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See SAVANNAH's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

In April 1997, SAVANNAH sold, through a public authority, $13.87 million of
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds due 2037. The proceeds will be
applied to the redemption on May 5, 1997 of $13.87 million of 6 3/4% pollution
control revenue bonds.

     SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
SAVANNAH expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any anticipated
security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at March 31,
1997, approximately $2.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$36.3 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. At March 31, 1997,
SAVANNAH had $4.2 million of short-term notes payable to banks. Since SAVANNAH
has no major generating plants under construction, management believes that the
need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)   The condensed financial statements of the registrants included herein 
      have been prepared by each registrant, without audit, pursuant to the
      rules and regulations of the SEC.  In the opinion of each registrant's 
      management, the information regarding such registrant furnished herein
      reflects all adjustments (which included only normal
      recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results for the 
      periods ended March 31, 1997 and 1996. Certain information and footnote
      disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
      accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
      condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations,
      although each registrant believes that the disclosures regarding such 
      registrant are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
      It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in
      conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included 
      in each registrant's latest annual report on Form 10-K.  Certain 
      prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current-
      period presentation.

         The condensed financial statements of ALABAMA and GEORGIA included
      herein have been reviewed by ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's independent public
      accountants as set forth in their reports included herein as Exhibit 1 to
      ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)   SOUTHERN's operating affiliates are subject to the provisions of FASB
      Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
      Regulation. In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no
      longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
      off related regulatory assets and liabilities, and determine if any other
      assets have been impaired. For additional information, see Note 1 to the
      financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(C)   The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
      practices of the electric utility industry--including
      SOUTHERN's--regarding the recognition, measurement and classification of
      decommissioning costs for nuclear generating facilities in the financial
      statements. In response to these questions, the FASB has decided to review
      the accounting for liabilities related to closure and removal of
      long-lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
      SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial
      statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA under "Depreciation and
      Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)   SOUTHERN engages in price risk management activities for trading and
      non-trading purposes. Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial
      statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a discussion of
      these activities. Activities for non-trading purposes consist of
      transactions that are employed to mitigate SOUTHERN's risk related to
      interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. At March 31, 1997, the
      status of outstanding non-trading related derivative contracts was as
      follows:

(E)   On January 29, 1997, Southern Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
      SOUTHERN, completed the acquisition of an 80% interest in CEPA for a total
      net investment of approximately $2.0 billion. (Reference is made to the
      Current Report on Form 8-K of SOUTHERN dated October 9, 1996 for a more
      detailed description of the acquisition.)

         The acquisition of CEPA was accounted for as a purchase with the $1.5
      billion excess of the acquisition cost over the preliminary estimate of
      the fair value of CEPA's net assets being assigned to goodwill. The
      allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and may be revised at a
      later date. Goodwill will be amortized on a straight-line basis over 40
      years. Results of operations of CEPA are included in the condensed
      consolidated financial statements subsequent to January 29, 1997.

         The following unaudited pro forma combined results of operations for
      the three months ended March 31, 1997 and 1996 have been prepared assuming
      the acquisition of CEPA had occurred at the beginning of each period. The
      pro forma results assume acquisition financing of $764 million of
      short-term borrowings, $792 million of long-term notes and $400 million of
      capital securities and SOUTHERN's assumed effective composite interest
      rate on these obligations for each period presented was 6.70%. Eventually,
      the existing borrowing may be replaced by some other combination of
      long-term debt and equity. The pro forma results are provided for
      information only. The results are not necessarily indicative of the actual
      results that would have been realized had the acquisition occurred on the
      indicated dates, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results of
      operations of the combined companies. The pro forma results for the three
      months ended March 31, 1996, include no revenues from CEPA's ownership
      interest in 2,715 megawatts of capacity that began commercial operation in
      mid-1996.

      Substantially all the assets of each trust are junior subordinated notes
      issued by the related company in the respective approximate principal
      amounts set forth above. The notes of Southern Capital are guaranteed by
      SOUTHERN. ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI, SIUK and SOUTHERN each
      considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the preferred or
      capital securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute a
      full and unconditional guarantee by it of the respective trusts' payment
      obligations with respect to the preferred or capital securities. Reference
      is also made to Note 9 to the financial statements of ALABAMA and GEORGIA
      in the Form 10-K.

(J)   In June 1995, the Alabama PSC issued a rate order granting ALABAMA's
      request for gradual adjustments to move toward parity among customer
      classes. This order also calls for a moratorium on any periodic retail
      rate increases (but not decreases) until July 2001. In December 1995, the
      Alabama PSC issued an order authorizing ALABAMA to reduce balance sheet
      items--such as plant and deferred charges--at any time ALABAMA's actual
      base rate revenues exceed the budgeted revenues. Reference is made to Note
      3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the
      Form 10-K for additional

      information. In April 1997, the Alabama PSC issued an additional order
      authorizing ALABAMA to reduce balance sheet asset items. This order
      authorizes the reduction of such items up to an amount equal to 5 times
      the total estimated annual revenue reduction resulting from future rate
      reductions.

(K)   In 1996, legal actions against ALABAMA were filed in several counties in
      Alabama charging ALABAMA with fraud and non-compliance with regulatory
      statutes relating to the offer, sale and financing of "extended service
      contracts" in connection with the sale of electric appliances. See Note 3
      to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for additional information.

(L)  In February 1996, the Georgia PSC approved a three-year  accounting  order,
     effective  January 1, 1996,  which is currently  under  appeal.  GEORGIA is
     continuing to recognize  expenses in accordance  with the accounting  order
     while it is under  appeal.  Under the order,  earnings in excess of a 12.5%
     retail return on common equity will be used to accelerate the  amortization
     of regulatory  assets or depreciation of electric plant.  Accordingly,  for
     earnings in excess of the 12.5% return,  GEORGIA recorded a charge of $19.8
     million  for the three  months  ended  March  31,  1997  (presented  in the
     accompanying  financial  statements  as  depreciation  expense  and  as  an
     addition to the  reserve for  depreciation).  For  additional  information,
     reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(M)   In 1987 and 1989, the Georgia PSC ordered that the allowed costs of Plant
      Vogtle, a two-unit nuclear facility of which GEORGIA owns 45.7%, be phased
      into rates. Pursuant to the orders, GEORGIA recorded a deferred return
      under phase-in plans until October 1991 when the allowed investment was
      fully reflected in rates. In 1991, the Georgia PSC levelized the remaining
      Plant Vogtle declining capacity buyback expenses over a six-year period.
      In addition, GEORGIA deferred certain Plant Vogtle operating expenses and
      financing costs under accounting orders issued by the Georgia PSC. These
      Georgia PSC orders provide for the recovery of deferred costs within 10
      years. The unamortized balance of these deferred costs at March 31, 1997,
      was $133 million.

(N)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information concerning the recovery
      by GEORGIA of its costs associated with the Rocky Mountain pumped storage
      hydroelectric plant.

(O)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item
      8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to an agreement reached
      January 10, 1997, between GEORGIA and MEAG relating to a new power supply
      relationship. A power supply contract entered into between GEORGIA and
      MEAG has been filed with FERC and is presently awaiting its approval.

(P)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
      designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
      Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
      environmental contingencies.

(Q)   SAVANNAH is currently undergoing an earnings review by the Georgia PSC,
      and to date, the Georgia PSC has made no determination.

                        relating to GEORGIA's tax accounting for the sale in
                        1984 of an interest in Plant Vogtle and related capacity
                        and energy buyback commitments.

                        (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
                        Alabama)

                        On April 10, 1997, ALABAMA, GEORGIA and MISSISSIPPI
                        joined in the filing of an action seeking to enjoin TVA
                        from violating a 1959 act which prohibits TVA from
                        selling power outside the area that was being served by
                        it in 1957. TVA is alleged to have entered into
                        arrangements with entities to which it may lawfully sell
                        power under the 1959 act which enable TVA to deliver
                        power to organizations for use outside TVA's statutorily
                        defined service territory. The plaintiffs contend such
                        arrangements are in violation of the 1959 act.
