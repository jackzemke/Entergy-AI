recoverability of GEORGIA's investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped storage
hydroelectric project as more fully discussed in Note (G) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein, been known, the information furnished herein
reflects all adjustments (which, except for the provision for separation
benefits as described in Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein,
included only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the
results for the periods ended June 30, 1995 and 1994. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or
omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although SOUTHERN believes that
the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in SOUTHERN's
latest annual report on Form 10-K.

                 THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations

Earnings
SOUTHERN's earnings for the second quarter and year-to-date 1995 were higher
than earnings recorded in the corresponding periods of 1994 primarily because of
higher retail revenues and, for year-to-date, costs recorded in the prior period
associated with workforce reduction programs for GEORGIA and the system service
company, SCS. Consolidated net income was $268 million ($0.40 per share) for the
second quarter of 1995, compared to $256 million ($0.39 per share) for the
second quarter of 1994. Earnings were $474 million ($0.71 per share) for
year-to-date 1995, compared to $398 million ($0.61 per share) in the
corresponding period of 1994. Disregarding the after-tax effect of the workforce
reduction programs of $57 million ($0.09 per share), year-to-date earnings would
have risen 4.2% over 1994's results.

Revenues
Retail energy sales increased 4.6% and 3.4% for the second quarter and
year-to-date 1995, respectively, due to the improvement in the economy and an
increase in customers served. An increase in wholesale energy sales was recorded
in the second quarter of 1995; however, such energy sales in 1994 reflected a
one-time reduction to GEORGIA's territorial wholesale customers as a result of a
new agreement with these customers. Wholesale energy sales for year-to-date 1995
decreased due to reduced demand and scheduled reductions in off-system
contracts. Capacity revenues for the second quarter and year-to-date 1995 were
$13 million and $27 million less than in the corresponding periods of 1994 and
coincided with GEORGIA completing the final sale in a series of four
transactions for the sale of Plant Scherer Unit 4 in June 1995. The capacity
from this unit had been dedicated to unit power sales.

Expenses
Although total generation for both periods of 1995 was approximately the same as
in 1994, fuel expense for the second quarter of 1995 increased due to the
displacement of nuclear and hydro generation with fossil generation. Fuel
expense for both periods of 1995 benefitted from the lower average cost of fuel
consumed. Purchased power expense in recent years has steadily declined because
of the reduction in capacity buyback payments by GEORGIA to the co-owners of
Plant Vogtle; however, an increase was recorded for the second quarter and
year-to-date 1995 because of the one-time reduction recorded in 1994 as a result
of a new agreement with GEORGIA's territorial wholesale customers. See Note (F)
to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for information regarding the
Georgia PSC's retail rate order that required the levelization of capacity
buyback expense for Plant Vogtle.

    Other operation expenses for the second quarter of 1995 increased for a
variety of factors including higher costs for demand side option programs
(recoverable through rates), higher employee benefit and training costs and the
recognition of emission allowance expense (also recoverable through rates).

                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations  (Continued)

ALABAMA accrues estimated operation and maintenance expenses related to nuclear
refueling outages during the period between outages. During the second quarter
of 1994, ALABAMA recorded a credit to the accrual to reflect actual incurred
costs. Other operation expense in the first quarter of 1994 included
approximately $93 million for costs associated with workforce reduction
programs. See Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein.)
Maintenance expenses for year-to-date 1995 decreased due to the timing of
scheduled maintenance on generating units. The increase in depreciation and
amortization is attributable to increased investment in plant.

Other Income
In May 1995, as a result of litigation, ALABAMA recorded a charge of $9 million
to reflect the refund of interest on financing of merchandise sales. See Note
(D) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for further details. On June 1
of 1994 and 1995, GEORGIA completed the third and fourth sales in a series of
four separate transactions to sell Plant Scherer Unit 4. Each of these sales
were for 16.55% of the unit. These sales generated cash of $133 million and $131
million, respectively, and resulted in after-tax gains of approximately $11
million and $12 million, respectively.

Interest Charges and Dividends on Preferred Stock
The decrease in interest on long-term debt reflects the SOUTHERN system's
efforts to decrease its capital costs. However, since January 1994, interest
rates have risen and SOUTHERN's subsidiaries have outstanding a number of
securities with dividend rates that vary according to prevailing market
conditions. Interest on interim obligations rose because of higher interest
rates on an increased average amount of short-term debt outstanding.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under construction
and not included in rate base. The equity portion represents non-cash income.
When facilities are completed and included in rate base, previously capitalized
amounts significantly increase cash flow because revenues are higher as a result
of the increased rate base and additional depreciation expense.

Future Earnings Potential
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings is contingent upon
numerous factors ranging from growth in energy sales to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     On July 13, 1995, SEI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SOUTHERN, made a tender
offer to acquire South Western in its entirety for approximately $1.6 billion.
Such offer is not being made in the United States. South Western is one of
twelve regional electricity companies in the United Kingdom. South Western's
principal business is the distribution of electricity to 1.3 million

customers in the southwest portion of England. As of August 2, 1995, SEI had
acquired approximately 16 million shares of South Western (14.4% of the issued
capital). For further information reference is made to SOUTHERN's Current Report
on Form 8-K dated July 13, 1995. SEI expects to learn within 60 days from the
date of the tender offer whether its bid will be successful. To date, the
management of South Western has recommended rejection of the offer.

     Reference is made to the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for further discussion of various uncertainties and legal proceedings related
to: the actions of regulators regarding the recovery of GEORGIA's investment in
the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project; a tax issue regarding
GEORGIA's tax accounting for the sale in 1984 of an interest in Plant Vogtle and
related capacity and energy buyback commitments; and the outcome of proceedings
initiated by the FERC to determine the appropriate return on equity on wholesale
power and transmission contracts.

     Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item
8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for
information regarding proceedings with respect to GEORGIA's recovery of
demand-side conservation program costs. On August 7, 1995, the Georgia PSC
ordered GEORGIA to discontinue the current demand-side conservation programs by
the end of 1995. The rate riders will continue in effect until costs deferred
are collected, not to exceed an $80 million cap as of December 31, 1995. In July
1995, GEORGIA recognized expenses of approximately $22 million for previously
deferred costs which will not be recovered under the riders and costs expected
to be incurred in excess of the capped amount.

     As discussed in Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein,
ALABAMA has a retail rate moratorium on increases (but not decreases) in effect
until July 2001.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
increased costs cannot be offset. The Clean Air Act is discussed under
"Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
SOUTHERN's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors. Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, and the rate of economic growth in SOUTHERN's service area. The
enactment of the Energy Act is beginning to have a dramatic effect on the
electric utility industry. A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy
Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SOUTHERN's 1994
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations  (Continued)

     The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition,
measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating
stations in financial statements. Further discussion of this issue is found in
"Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
SOUTHERN's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 of
SOUTHERN's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on certain
environmental contingencies.

     SOUTHERN's operating subsidiaries are subject to the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In
the event that a portion of the company's operations is no longer subject to
these provisions, SOUTHERN would be required to write-off related regulatory
assets and liabilities. See Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of
SOUTHERN's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This
statement requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount for an
asset may not be recoverable. This statement also imposes stricter criteria for
regulatory assets by requiring that such assets be probable of future recovery
at each balance sheet date. SOUTHERN anticipates adopting this standard by
January 1, 1996 and does not expect that adoption will have a material impact on
the financial position or results of operations of SOUTHERN based on the current
regulatory structure in which SOUTHERN operates. This conclusion may change in
the future as competitive factors influence wholesale and retail pricing in this
industry.

Financial Condition

Overview
The major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first half of
1995 were the addition of approximately $658 million to utility plant, the
commercial operation of eleven generating units designed for peak demand
(approximately 860 megawatts of capacity, including two units of the Rocky
Mountain project), and the consummation of the final transaction in the sale of
Plant Scherer Unit 4. The funds for gross property additions and other capital
requirements were derived primarily from operations and the sale of common stock
by SOUTHERN. See SOUTHERN's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Capital Structure
One of SOUTHERN's goals is to maintain common equity as a percent of total
capitalization, including short-term debt and the current portion of
capitalization, within a range of 40 to 45%. This

                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Financial Condition  (Continued)

ratio was 45.4% at June 30, 1995, compared to 44.4% at December 31, 1994. The
market price of SOUTHERN's common stock at June 30, 1995, was $22.375 per share,
compared to a book value of $12.68. This represents a market-to-book value ratio
of 176%. The dividend for the second quarter of 1995 was 30.5 cents per share.

Capital Requirements for Construction
The construction program of SOUTHERN's operating subsidiaries is budgeted at
$4.0 billion for the three years 1995 through 1997 ($1.4 billion in 1995, $1.3
billion in 1996 and $1.3 billion in 1997). Actual construction costs may vary
from this estimate because of such factors as changes in business conditions;
changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulations; changes in environmental
regulations; revised load growth projections; increasing costs of labor,
equipment and materials; and the cost of capital.

     Current energy demand forecasts do not require any additional baseload
generating facilities until well into the future. However, within the service
area, the construction of combustion turbine peaking units of approximately 380
megawatts (in addition to those units that began commercial operation in 1995)
is planned to be completed by 1997. In addition, significant construction will
continue related to transmission and distribution facilities and the upgrading
and extension of the useful lives of generating plants. Also, see Note 6 to the
financial statements in Item 8 in SOUTHERN's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for
information regarding GEORGIA's joint ownership agreement for a combustion
turbine unit in Florida.

     Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the
Southern electric system's capital requirements and operating costs. The acid
rain compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will impact the Southern electric
system. This legislation, as well as other legislation and regulations, are
described under "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in SOUTHERN's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The full impact of these
requirements cannot be determined at this time, pending the development and
implementation of applicable regulations.

Other Capital Requirements
In addition to the funds needed for the construction program, approximately $708
million will be required by June 30, 1996, for present sinking fund requirements
and maturities of long-term debt. Included in this amount is $136 million on
deposit with the trustee that may be used only for the redemption of first
mortgage bonds. Also, the operating subsidiaries plan to continue, to the extent
possible, a program to retire high-cost debt and preferred stock and replace
these obligations with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Funds
In addition to the sale of common stock in the first half of 1995, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital

                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Financial Condition  (Continued)

to be raised in 1995, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on
SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The operating subsidiaries plan to obtain
the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources similar to
those used in the past. However, the type and timing of financings will depend
on market conditions, maintenance of adequate earnings, and regulatory approval.

     Mobile filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 to register $280 million
of first mortgage bonds. In anticipation of the first mortgage bond offering and
the concurrent offering of tax exempt bonds, Mobile entered into interest rate
hedging agreements in order to achieve a targeted aggregate annual debt service.
Interest rates have decreased since these hedging agreements were executed;
accordingly Mobile expects to pay $46 million to terminate these agreements.
Such amounts will be funded from the proceeds from the first mortgage bond issue
and will be recorded as a cost of the new securities. Mobile expects to achieve
its targeted annual debt service as a result of these transactions.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
June 30, 1995, approximately $116 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $1.5 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks.

     In connection with SEI's tender offer for South Western, SOUTHERN
established credit commitments with four banks for $700 million. As of August 3,
1995, none of these credit commitments had been utilized.

     At June 30, 1995, the system companies had outstanding $396 million of
notes payable and $570 million of commercial paper. The short-term lines of
credit may not be utilized in their entirety without additional regulatory
approval. Since the construction program with respect to major generating
projects has been completed, management believes that the need for working
capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining
large cash balances.

     In order to issue additional first mortgage bonds and preferred stock, the
operating subsidiaries must comply with certain earnings coverage requirements
outlined in their respective mortgage indentures and corporate charters. The
coverage ratios of SOUTHERN's operating subsidiaries are sufficiently high to
permit, at present interest and dividend rate levels, any foreseeable security
sales. The amount of securities which they will be permitted to issue in the
future will depend upon market conditions and other factors prevailing at that
time.

                             ALABAMA POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations

ALABAMA's earnings during the second quarter and year-to-date 1995 were lower,
compared to the same periods of 1994, due primarily to increases in non-fuel
operating expenses. Compared to the corresponding periods of 1994, net income
after dividends on preferred stock was $9.7 million lower in the second quarter
of 1995 and $16.4 million lower year-to-date.

Revenues
Operating revenues for the second quarter and year-to-date 1995 decreased from
the corresponding periods of 1994 due primarily to fewer energy sales to
affiliated companies and, for year-to-date revenues, lower fuel clause revenues.
Retail energy sales rose 4.3% in the second quarter and 3.6% year-to-date due
primarily to an increase in customers served and the improving economy in
Alabama. Also, some reductions in non-affiliated revenues occurred due to a
decrease in capacity payments received from these customers of $2.9 million for
the second quarter and $5.9 million year-to-date. Total energy sales decreased
5.5% for the quarter and 4.0% year-to-date 1995 as a result of the decreases in
wholesale energy sales to both affiliates and non-affiliates.

     Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period
depending on demand, the availability, and the variable production cost of
generating resources at each company.

Expenses
Fuel expense for both the second quarter and year-to-date 1995 decreased because
of lower generation and average cost of fuel consumed, despite the partial
displacement of nuclear and hydro generation with coal-fired generation. ALABAMA
accrues estimated operation and maintenance expenses related to nuclear
refueling outages during the period between outages. The increase in other
operation and maintenance expenses for both second quarter and year-to-date 1995
is primarily due to credits to expense for this accrual in 1994 and the
expiration, in 1994, of the amortization of credits associated with the Gulf
States Utilities settlement. The increase in depreciation and amortization
reflects additions to utility plant. The decrease in income tax expense is
attributable to the change in earnings.

Other Income
In May 1995, pursuant to litigation, ALABAMA recorded a charge of $9 million to
reflect the refund of interest on the sales of merchandise by vendors other than
ALABAMA. See Note (D) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for further
details. The change in "Other, net" is primarily attributable to decreases in
contributions to non-profit organizations.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are
necessary to finance the construction of new facilities. While cash is not
realized currently from such allowance, it is

realized over the service life of the plant through increased revenues resulting
from a higher rate base and higher depreciation expense

Interest Charges
Interest on interim obligations rose due to higher interest rates on an
increased average amount of short-term debt outstanding. Other interest charges
for the second quarter and year-to-date 1995 reflect interest on federal income
tax assessments arising from the audit for the tax years 1988-1990.

Future Earnings Potential
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from growth in energy sales to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     Discussed in Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein are the
proceedings concerning the reasonableness of the Southern electric system's
wholesale rate schedules and contracts. Also, see Note (E) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for information regarding a retail rate moratorium
and the application of adjustments to achieve parity among the various rate
classes.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
cost increases cannot be offset. The Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues are discussed under "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's
Discussion and Analysis in ALABAMA's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Future earnings will also depend upon growth in electric sales which are
subject to a number of factors. Traditionally, these factors have included
changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced
by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather, competition, and the rate of
economic growth in ALABAMA's service area. However, the enactment of the Energy
Act is beginning to have a dramatic effect on the electric utility industry. A
discussion of the potential impact of the Energy Act and particularly its effect
on competition is found under "Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 -
Management's Discussion and Analysis in ALABAMA's 1994 Annual Report on Form
10-K.

     The staff of the SEC has questioned certain current accounting practices of
the electric utility industry regarding the recognition, measurement and
classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating stations in
financial statements. Further discussion of this issue is found under "Future
Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
ALABAMA's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Results of Operations  (Continued)

     ALABAMA is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a portion of
the company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, ALABAMA would
be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1
to the financial statements in Item 8 in ALABAMA's 1994 Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information.

     In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This
statement requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount for an
asset may not be recoverable. This statement also imposes stricter criteria for
regulatory assets by requiring that such assets be probable of future recovery
at each balance sheet date. ALABAMA anticipates adopting this standard by
January 1, 1996 and does not expect that adoption will have a material impact on
the financial position or results of operations of ALABAMA based on the current
regulatory structure in which ALABAMA operates. This conclusion may change in
the future as competitive factors influence wholesale and retail pricing in this
industry.

Financial Condition

Overview
The principal change in ALABAMA's financial condition in the first half of 1995
was gross property additions of $247 million to utility plant. The funds for
gross property additions were derived from operating activities and an increase
in short-term debt. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows herein for
further details. ALABAMA's common equity as a percent of total capitalization
was 48.1% at June 30, 1995, compared to 47.4% at year-end 1994.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
ALABAMA has committed lines of credit and regulatory approval for short-term
borrowings of up to $530 million. At June 30, 1995, ALABAMA had outstanding $372
million of commercial paper.

     Capital expenditures are estimated to total $1.6 billion for the three
years 1995 through 1997 ($604 million in 1995, $500 million in 1996 and $502
million in 1997). Current energy demand forecasts do not require any additional
baseload generating facilities until well into the future. However, five
combustion turbine peaking units (400 megawatts of capacity) began commercial
operation in May 1995 to meet increased peak-hour demand and an additional four
units (320 megawatts of capacity) are scheduled to be placed in service in 1996.
In addition, significant construction of transmission and distribution
facilities and upgrading of generating plants will continue.

                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Financial Condition  (Continued)

    The capital budget is subject to periodic review and revision and capital
costs incurred may vary from estimates because of several factors, including
changes in business conditions; revised load growth projections; changes in
environmental regulations; changes in existing nuclear plant to meet new
regulatory requirements; increasing costs of labor, equipment and materials; and
the cost of capital.

    In addition to the funds needed for the capital budget, approximately $60.8
million will be required by June 30, 1996, for debt maturities. Also, ALABAMA
will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these
obligations with lower-cost capital, as market conditions permit.

    It is anticipated that the funds required will be derived from sources
similar to those used in the past. In order to issue additional first mortgage
bonds and preferred stock, ALABAMA must comply with certain earnings coverage
requirements contained in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter.
ALABAMA's coverages are at a level that would permit any necessary amount of
security sales at current interest and dividend rates. The amount of securities
which ALABAMA will be permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market
conditions and other factors prevailing at that time.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS





TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of June 30, 1995, and the related condensed statements of income for
the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 1995 and 1994, and
condensed statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 1995
and 1994. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1994
(not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 15, 1995, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1994 is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                             GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
              MANAGEMENT'S OPINION AS TO FAIR STATEMENT OF RESULTS


     The condensed financial statements of GEORGIA included herein have been
prepared by GEORGIA, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
SEC. As more fully discussed in Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein, an uncertainty exists with respect to the actions of the regulators
regarding the recoverability of GEORGIA's investment in the Rocky Mountain
pumped storage hydroelectric project. In the opinion of GEORGIA's management,
subject to the effect of such adjustments, if any, as might have been required
had the outcome of the uncertainty been known, the information regarding GEORGIA
furnished herein reflects all adjustments (which, except for the provisions for
separation benefits recorded in 1994 as described in Note (C) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein, included only normal recurring adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the results for the periods ended June 30, 1995 and
1994. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations,
although GEORGIA believes that the disclosures regarding GEORGIA are adequate to
make the information presented not misleading. It is suggested that these
condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and the notes thereto included in GEORGIA's latest annual report on
Form 10-K.

                             GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations

Earnings
GEORGIA recorded higher earnings for both the second quarter and year-to-date
1995 compared to the corresponding periods of 1994, primarily as a result of
higher retail energy sales and lower interest charges. Earnings for the first
quarter of 1994 also reflected expenses related to workforce reduction programs
at GEORGIA and the system service company, SCS. (See Note (C) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein.) Net income after dividends on preferred stock rose
$9.2 million in the second quarter of 1995 and $67.7 million in the first six
months of 1995, compared to the corresponding periods of 1994. Disregarding the
after-tax effect of the provision for separation benefits in 1994, GEORGIA's
earnings for the first half of 1995 still would have been $13.8 million above
earnings in the first half of 1994.

Revenues
Total operating revenues for both periods of 1995 increased compared to the
corresponding periods of 1994 primarily because of higher retail energy sales.
Excluding fuel clause revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses and do not affect income, operating revenues for the second quarter and
year-to-date 1995 increased $18.2 million and $26.1 million, respectively,
compared to the corresponding periods of 1994.

     Retail - Retail energy sales in 1995 increased 4.5% in the second quarter
and 3.6% year-to-date over the corresponding periods of 1994 primarily because
of an increase in customers served and continued expansion of Georgia's economy.
Residential, commercial and industrial energy sales for the second quarter and
year-to-date 1995 increased 5.5% and 2.9%; 4.7% and 3.7%; and 3.7% and 3.9%,
respectively. Total non-fuel retail revenues increased $29.0 million in the
second quarter of 1995 and $44.8 million in the first six months of 1995. Of
these amounts, $7.3 million and $14.9 million, respectively, are attributable to
increased revenues from demand-side option programs collected through rate
riders reinstated in December 1994. Revenues from demand-side programs generally
represent the direct recovery of program costs. See Note (H) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for additional information on these programs.

     Wholesale - Energy sales to non-affiliated wholesale customers increased
33.8% in the second quarter of 1995 and decreased 10.6% year-to-date compared to
the corresponding periods of 1994. The increase in the second quarter is
primarily due to a one-time reduction in energy sales to territorial wholesale
customers in 1994 that reflected the impact of a new agreement with these
customers. Capacity revenues from non-affiliated utilities outside the service
area were down $6.5 million for the second quarter of 1995 and $15.8 million
year-to-date. These capacity revenues decreased as scheduled, coinciding with
GEORGIA completing the final in a series of four transactions for the sale of
Plant Scherer Unit 4 in June 1995. Energy revenues from non-affiliated utilities
outside the service area decreased $19.7 million and $ 44.8 million,

respectively. The energy component of contract sales is priced at approximately
the variable production cost and does not materially affect earnings.

     Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

Operating Expenses
Fuel and Purchased Power - Fuel expense increased because of higher generation
and, for the second quarter of 1995, the displacement of hydro generation with
coal-fired generation. Purchased power expense for year-to-date 1995 decreased
primarily due to lower energy purchases from non-affiliated companies and
scheduled reductions in capacity buyback payments to the co-owners of Plant
Vogtle. See Note (F) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the levelization of capacity buyback expense for Plant
Vogtle. However, purchased power from non-affiliates increased in the second
quarter of 1995 primarily due to a one-time reduction in energy purchases from
territorial wholesale customers in 1994 that reflected the impact of a new
agreement with these customers.

     Other - As part of the SOUTHERN system's effort to curtail growth in
operating expenses, both GEORGIA and SCS initiated workforce reduction programs
in the first quarter of 1994. See Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for further details. Other operation expense for 1995 increased, compared
to 1994, primarily as a result of costs associated with demand-side option
programs. The demand-side option program costs were offset by increases in
retail revenues. Environmental remediation costs at various sites were $3.9
million through June 1995, compared to $5.3 million in the first half of 1994.
Income taxes for year-to-date 1994 reflect the effect of the workforce reduction
programs.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under construction
and is included in rate base. The equity portion of AFUDC represents non-cash
income. The amount of AFUDC recorded is dependent upon the level of construction
work in progress, capital costs and capitalization ratios. Based upon GEORGIA's
construction budget, AFUDC is estimated to total $21 million in 1995 and $17
million in 1996.

Other Income
On June 1 of 1994 and 1995, GEORGIA completed the third and fourth sales in
a series of four separate transactions to sell Plant Scherer Unit 4. Each sale
was for 16.55% of the unit. These

sales generated cash of $133 million and $131 million, respectively, and
resulted in after-tax gains of approximately $11 million and $12 million,
respectively.

Interest Charges and Dividends on Preferred Stock
Interest charges on long-term debt have declined due to refinancing efforts over
the past twelve months. Also, GEORGIA used the proceeds from the Plant Scherer
sales to redeem higher cost securities. Other interest charges have declined
during 1995, as compared to 1994, due to interest accrued during 1994 on tax
assessments. Dividends on preferred stock have increased because GEORGIA has
outstanding $175 million aggregate stated value of preferred stock that have
variable dividend rates, which have risen since year-end 1993. Interest on
interim obligations rose due to higher interest rates.

Future Earnings Potential
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings. The level of future earnings depends on numerous factors
including energy sales and regulatory matters.

     Growth in energy sales is subject to a number of factors which
traditionally have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities,
energy conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, and the rate of economic growth in GEORGIA's service area. The
enactment of the Energy Act is having a dramatic effect on the electric utility
industry. A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy Act and
particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in GEORGIA's 1994
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Four combustion turbine units and two pumped storage hydroelectric units
began commercial operation in the second quarter of 1995 and a third pumped
storage hydroelectric unit began commercial operation in July. GEORGIA has
entered into a four-year purchase power agreement to meet peaking needs.
Beginning in 1996, GEORGIA will purchase 400 megawatts of capacity. In 1998,
this amount will decline to 200 megawatts for the remaining two years. Capacity
payments are projected to be $6 million in 1996 and 1997 and $3 million in 1998
and 1999. GEORGIA has also entered into a purchase power agreement whereby
GEORGIA will buy electricity during peak periods from a proposed 300 megawatt
cogeneration facility, starting in June 1998. The agreement is expected to be
filed with the Georgia PSC for certification during 1995.

     GEORGIA sold in June 1995 its remaining ownership interest (16.55%) in
Plant Scherer Unit 4 to two Florida utilities. This transaction coincided with
scheduled reductions in capacity revenues from Florida utilities under unit
power sales contracts of approximately $18 million in 1995 and an additional $10
million in 1996.

     As discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item 8 of
the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K, regulatory
uncertainties exist related to the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric
project. In the event the Georgia PSC does not allow full recovery of the
project's costs, then the portion not allowed may have to be written off.
GEORGIA's total investment in the project at completion is estimated to be
approximately $200 million.

     Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item
8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for
information regarding proceedings with respect to GEORGIA's recovery of
demand-side conservation program costs. On August 7, 1995, the Georgia PSC
ordered GEORGIA to discontinue the current demand-side conservation programs by
the end of 1995. The rate riders will continue in effect until costs deferred
are collected, not to exceed an $80 million cap as of December 31, 1995. In July
1995, GEORGIA recognized expenses of approximately $22 million for previously
deferred costs which will not be recovered under the riders and costs expected
to be incurred in excess of the capped amount.

     Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item
8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for
information regarding proceedings with respect to litigation currently pending
in the U. S. Tax Court. Also see Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for developments concerning the joint complaints filed by OPC and MEAG in
two separate venues seeking to recover from GEORGIA approximately $16.5 million
in alleged partial requirements rates overcharges, plus approximately $6.3
million in interest.

     The FERC regulates wholesale rate schedules and power sales contracts that
GEORGIA has with its sales for resale customers. The FERC currently is reviewing
the rate of return on common equity included in these schedules and contracts
and may require such returns to be lowered, possibly retroactively. See Note 3
to the financial statements in Item 8 in GEORGIA's 1994 Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information.

     The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition,
measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating
stations in financial statements. Further discussion of this issue is found in
"Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 -Management's Discussion and Analysis in
GEORGIA's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Note 4 to the financial statements in Item 8 of
GEORGIA's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on certain
environmental contingencies.

     GEORGIA is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a portion of
the company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, GEORGIA would
be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1
to the financial statements in Item 8 of GEORGIA's 1994 Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information.

     In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This
statement requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. This statement also imposes stricter criteria for
regulatory assets by requiring that such assets be probable of future recovery
at each balance sheet date. GEORGIA anticipates adopting this standard by
January 1, 1996 and does not expect that adoption will have a material impact on
the financial position or results of operations of GEORGIA based on the current
regulatory structure in which GEORGIA operates. This conclusion may change in
the future as competitive factors influence wholesale and retail pricing in this
industry.

Financial Condition

Overview
The principal changes in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first six
months of 1995 were additions of $217 million to utility plant and the
commercial operation of four combustion turbine units (cumulatively, 320
megawatts of capacity) and two of the three units of the Rocky Mountain pumped
storage hydroelectric project (GEORGIA's ownership interest is approximately 70
megawatts of capacity per unit). Additionally, GEORGIA completed the final in a
series of four transactions for the sale of Plant Scherer Unit 4. The funds
needed for gross property additions are currently provided from operations. See
GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Construction and Other Capital Requirements
Estimated construction expenditures for the years 1995 through 1997 are $579
million, $626 million and $724 million, respectively. GEORGIA's management has
adopted an initiative to reduce its 1996 and 1997 construction expenditures by
approximately 10% from currently estimated amounts. There can be no assurance
that such reductions will be achieved.

     The Clean Air Act will impact the capital requirements of the Southern
electric system. This legislation, as well as other legislation and regulations,
is described under "Environmental Issues" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion
and Analysis in GEORGIA's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Financial Condition  (Continued)

     Cash requirements for long-term debt maturities and redemptions total
approximately $553 million for the twelve months ending June 30, 1996. Included
in this amount is the redemption of $135 million of first mortgage bonds for
which funds are on deposit with the trustee and may be used only for that
purpose.

Sources of Funds
GEORGIA expects to meet future capital requirements primarily using funds from
operations and, if needed, by the issuance of new debt and equity securities,
term loans and short-term borrowings. Cash from operations for the first six
months of 1995 increased, as compared to the corresponding period in 1994,
primarily because of an increase in revenues and a decrease in income tax and
interest payments.

     GEORGIA must comply with coverage requirements of its mortgage indenture
and corporate charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.
GEORGIA's ability to satisfy all coverage requirements is such that it could
issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock to provide sufficient funds
for all anticipated requirements. The amount of securities which GEORGIA will be
permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market conditions and other
factors prevailing at that time.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had approximately
$540 million of unused credit arrangements with banks at June 30, 1995.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of June 30, 1995, and the related condensed
statements of income for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30,
1995 and 1994, and the condensed statements of cash flows for the six-month
periods ended June 30, 1995 and 1994. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     As more fully discussed in Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements,
an uncertainty exists with respect to the actions of the regulators regarding
the recoverability of the Company's investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped
storage hydroelectric project. The outcome of this uncertainty cannot presently
be determined. Accordingly, no provision for any writedown of the costs
associated with the Rocky Mountain facility resulting from the potential actions
of the Georgia Public Service Commission has been made in the accompanying
Condensed Financial Statements.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1994
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 15, 1995, we included
an explanatory paragraph which describes an uncertainty with respect to the
actions of the regulators regarding the recoverability of the Company's
investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project. In our
opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet
as of December 31, 1994, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation
to the balance sheet from which it has been derived.

                               GULF POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations

Earnings
GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for both the second quarter
and year-to-date 1995 increased over the same periods of 1994 by $5.2 million
and $6.0 million, respectively. The rise in earnings was primarily due to higher
retail revenues, lower net interest charges and decreased non-fuel operation
expenses as discussed below.

Revenues
Retail energy sales for the second quarter and year-to-date 1995 increased 6.3%
and 3.1%, respectively, over the corresponding periods of 1994 due primarily to
an increase in customers served, favorable economic conditions, and hotter
weather in 1995. Retail revenues also increased because of higher regulatory
cost recovery clause revenues. The regulatory clause recovery provisions equal
the related expenses and have no material effect on net income. Wholesale energy
sales to non-affiliates for the second quarter and year-to-date 1995 decreased
with capacity revenues lower by $2.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively.
Also, included in operating revenues for 1995 are amounts collected to recover
county franchise fees. These collections are also included in taxes other than
income taxes and have no impact on earnings (see discussion under "Expenses").
Including energy sales to affiliated companies, total energy sales increased
3.0% for the second quarter and 2.4% year-to-date 1995.

Expenses
Fuel expenses for the second quarter and year-to-date 1995 increased over the
same periods of 1994 due to an increase in generation. Purchased power
transactions (both sales and purchases) among the affiliated companies within
the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and variable cost of generating resources at each company.
Other operation expenses for the second quarter and year-to-date 1995, compared
to the corresponding periods of last year, were lower due primarily to a
reduction in costs associated with a coal supply suspension agreement, which was
essentially fully amortized by year-end 1994. See Note 5 to the financial
statements in Item 8 in GULF's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional
information. Additionally, during the first quarter of 1994, GULF recorded its
share of costs associated with a workforce reduction program at the system
service company. Maintenance expenses will fluctuate due primarily to the
scheduling of maintenance on production facilities. The decrease in depreciation
and amortization is attributable to the amortization of limited-term property,
which was fully amortized by December 1994. The increase in taxes other than
income taxes is attributable to county franchise fees being collected in 1995 as
discussed above.

Interest Charges and Dividends on Preferred Stock
The decrease in interest on long-term debt reflects GULF's efforts to decrease
its capital costs through refinancings of higher-cost issues. Interest on notes
payable rose because of higher interest rates on an increased average
outstanding amount of notes payable. Other interest charges in the second
quarter of 1994 included a $2.1 million contingent liability related to
potential assessments arising from a federal

income tax audit for the tax years 1988-1990. To the extent it is economically
feasible, GULF will continue its efforts to lower its capital costs.

Future Earnings Potential
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on a number of
factors ranging from growth in energy sales to the effects of a less regulated,
more competitive environment.

     Future earnings in the near term will depend upon growth in energy sales,
which is subject to a number of factors. Traditionally, these factors have
included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation
practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather, competition, and the
rate of economic growth in GULF's service area. The enactment of the Energy Act
is beginning to have a dramatic effect on the electric utility industry. A
discussion of the potential impact of the Energy Act and particularly its effect
on competition is found under "Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 -
Management's Discussion and Analysis in GULF's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Hurricane Erin struck GULF's service territory on August 3, 1995. The
expense of repairing damages will be charged to the Property Damage Reserve.
Management believes that the cost of repairing damages and the loss of revenue
will not have a material effect on future results of operations.

     See Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 in GULF's 1994 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the hearings ordered by the FERC
regarding the reasonableness of the return on common equity on certain of the
Southern electric system's wholesale rate schedules and contracts.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could reduce earnings if such
increased costs are not fully recovered. The Clean Air Act is discussed further
under "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis
in GULF's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See also Note 3 to the financial
statements in Item 8 in GULF's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion
of the Environmental Cost Recovery clause which provides for the recovery of
such costs.

     GULF is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting for
the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a portion of the
company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, GULF would be
required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1 to
the financial statements in Item 8 in GULF's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for
additional information.

In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This
statement requires that long-lived assets

be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. This statement also
imposes stricter criteria for regulatory assets by requiring that such assets be
probable of future recovery at each balance sheet date. GULF anticipates
adopting this standard by January 1, 1996 and does not expect that adoption will
have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of
GULF based on the current regulatory structure in which GULF operates. This
conclusion may change in the future as competitive factors influence wholesale
and retail pricing in this industry.

Financial Condition

Overview
The major change in GULF's financial condition during the first half of 1995 was
gross property additions of $29.9 million. The principal sources of funds for
these additions and other capital requirements were provided from operations.
See the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Capital Requirements for Construction
GULF's gross property additions, including those amounts related to
environmental compliance, are estimated to total approximately $225 million for
the three years 1995 through 1997 ($62 million in 1995, $79 million in 1996 and
$84 million in 1997). The estimates of property additions for the three-year
period include $13 million committed to meeting the requirements of the Clean
Air Act, the cost of which is expected to be recovered through the Environmental
Cost Recovery clause. Actual construction costs may vary from these estimates
because of factors such as changes in environmental regulations, revised load
projections, the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and
materials, and the cost of capital. GULF does not have any baseload generating
plants under construction, however, construction related to maintenance and
upgrading transmission and distribution facilities and generating plants will
continue.

     Various environmental legislation and other related regulations are
described in "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in GULF's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The full impact of these
requirements cannot be determined at this time, pending the development and
implementation of applicable regulations.

     In addition to the funds required for the construction program, $34.1
million will be required by June 30, 1996, in connection with maturities and
redemptions of long-term debt. GULF plans to continue a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these obligations with
lower-cost capital as market conditions and terms of the instruments permit.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Financial Condition  (Continued)

     At June 30, 1995, GULF had $65.8 million of unused credit arrangements with
banks to meet its short-term cash needs. GULF had $56 million of short-term bank
borrowings outstanding at June 30, 1995.

     It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be derived
from operations, the sale of additional first mortgage bonds and preferred
stock, and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. GULF is required to meet certain
coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter
to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. GULF's coverage ratios
are sufficient to permit, at present interest and dividend rate levels, any
foreseeable security sales. The amount of securities which GULF will be
permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market conditions and other
factors prevailing at that time.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations

Net Income
MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second
quarter and year-to-date 1995 rose $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively,
compared to the corresponding periods of 1994. Net income rose primarily because
of lower maintenance expenses and a retail rate increase under the ECO plan.

Revenues
Revenues for the second quarter and year-to-date 1995 decreased, compared to the
same periods of 1994, because of lower fuel clause revenues. Additionally,
non-affiliated wholesale capacity revenues decreased approximately $0.5 million
each quarter of 1995, compared to prior year. Partially offsetting these factors
were a retail rate increase of $3.7 million annually under the ECO plan that
became effective May 1995 and higher retail and territorial wholesale energy
sales. MISSISSIPPI registered respective increases of 2.7% and 1.0% in retail
energy sales and respective increases of 12.1% and 6.8% in territorial wholesale
sales. Retail energy sales increased because of the expanding economy in coastal
Mississippi (particularly the commercial sector), an increase in the number of
customers served and, with respect to the second quarter, weather influences.
The customer demand experienced by territorial wholesale customers is determined
by factors very similar to MISSISSIPPI's, however, their growth in energy sales
exceeds MISSISSIPPI's. Additionally, MISSISSIPPI began serving a new cooperative
in the second quarter of 1995. Total energy sales, compared to prior year,
increased 1.5% for the second quarter and decreased 0.3% year-to-date 1995.

Expenses
Fuel expense for the second quarter and year-to-date 1995 increased over the
corresponding periods of 1994 due to an increase in generation of 18.3% and
33.6%, respectively. Generation in 1994 was impacted by the timing of scheduled
maintenance on production facilities. Purchased power transactions (both sales
and purchases) among the affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system will vary from period to period depending on demand and the availability
and variable cost of generating resources at each company.

     Other operation expenses for year-to-date 1995, compared to the
corresponding period in 1994, increased primarily due to the amortization of
workforce reduction programs and, pursuant to the Clean Air Act, the recognition
of emission allowance expense. Such emission allowances are a recoverable
expense under the ECO plan. Depreciation in 1995 increased due to additions to
utility plant, particularly, the commercial operation of a combustion turbine
unit in May 1994. Taxes other than income taxes decreased because of lower
revenues. The increase in income tax expense reflects the assessment of
approximately $1.0 million in additional federal income taxes pursuant an audit
for the tax years 1988-1990. Additionally, MISSISSIPPI incurred interest on this
tax assessment of approximately $0.55 million which is reflected in other
interest charges. The additional tax and interest was paid in June 1995.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction. The equity portion of AFUDC represents non-cash income. However,
when facilities are completed and included in rate base, previously capitalized
amounts increase cash flow because revenues are higher as a result of the
increased rate base and additional depreciation expense. The amount of AFUDC
recorded in 1994 was higher because of MISSISSIPPI's investment in the
construction of a combustion turbine generating unit. This unit began commercial
operation in May 1994.

Future Earnings Potential
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales to a less
regulated, more competitive environment. Operating revenues will be affected by
any changes in rates under the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a
stabilizing force on electric rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking
place. Also see Notes (B) and (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding FERC's review of equity returns and workforce
reduction programs, respectively.

     MISSISSIPPI's 1995 annual filing under the ECO plan with the Mississippi
PSC resulted in an approved annual revenue requirement, effective in May 1995,
of $3.7 million, including $1.6 million of 1994 carryover.

     Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors. Traditionally, these factors
have included the rate of economic growth in MISSISSIPPI's service area,
customer growth, competition, weather, changes in contracts with neighboring
utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, and the elasticity of
demand. The enactment of the Energy Act is beginning to have a dramatic effect
on the electric utility industry. A discussion of the potential impact of the
Energy Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future
Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
MISSISSIPPI's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     MISSISSIPPI is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,
Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a
portion of the company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions,
MISSISSIPPI would be required to write off related regulatory assets and
liabilities. See Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 in MISSISSIPPI's
1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

     In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This
statement requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. This statement also imposes stricter criteria for

regulatory assets by requiring that such assets be probable of future recovery
at each balance sheet date. MISSISSIPPI anticipates adopting this standard by
January 1, 1996, and does not expect that adoption will have a material impact
on the financial position or results of operations of MISSISSIPPI based on the
current regulatory structure in which MISSISSIPPI operates. This conclusion may
change in the future as competitive factors influence wholesale and retail
pricing in this industry.

Financial Condition

Overview
During the first half of 1995, gross property additions were $36.8 million. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from internal sources and an increase in short-term debt. See the Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

     At June 30, 1995, cash totaled approximately $1.4 million and MISSISSIPPI
had $97 million of unused credit arrangements with banks to meet short-term cash
needs. MISSISSIPPI had $27 million of notes payable outstanding at quarter-end.
It is MISSISSIPPI's strategy to maintain a permanent layer of short-term debt,
approximately $40 million through the end of 1995, consistent with its overall
risk capital strategy.

Capital Requirements
MISSISSIPPI's gross property additions for the next three years are estimated to
be $223 million ($78 million in 1995, $73 million in 1996 and $72 million in
1997). The major emphasis within the construction program will be on upgrading
existing facilities. Included in these construction estimates is $2.9 million
committed to meeting the requirements of the Clean Air Act regulations.
Revisions may be necessary because of factors such as revised load projections,
the availability and cost of capital and changes in environmental regulations.

     In addition to the funds required for the construction program,
approximately $56.1 million will be required by June 30, 1996, for maturities of
long-term debt. It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and
other purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be
derived from operations, the sale of additional first mortgage bonds, pollution
control bonds and preferred stock and the receipt of additional capital
contributions from SOUTHERN. MISSISSIPPI is required to meet certain coverage
requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter to issue
new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. MISSISSIPPI's coverage ratios are
sufficiently high to permit, at present interest and dividend rate levels, any
foreseeable security sales. The amount of securities which MISSISSIPPI will be
able to issue in the future will depend upon market conditions and other factors
prevailing at that time.

Environmental Matters
Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the Southern
electric system's capital requirements and operating costs. The acid rain
compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will impact the Southern electric
system. This legislation, as well as other legislation and regulations, are
described under "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in MISSISSIPPI's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The full impact of
these requirements cannot be determined at this time pending the development and
implementation of applicable regulations. MISSISSIPPI's management believes that
the ECO plan will provide for retail recovery of the Clean Air Act costs.

     MISSISSIPPI must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that
cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and
regulations, MISSISSIPPI could incur costs to clean up properties currently or
previously owned. Upon identifying potential sites, the company conducts
studies, when possible, to determine the extent of any required remediation.
Should remediation be determined to be probable, reasonable estimates of costs
to clean up such sites are developed and recognized in the financial statements.
A currently owned site where manufactured gas plant operations were located
prior to MISSISSIPPI's ownership is under investigation for potential
remediation, but no prediction can presently be made regarding the extent, if
any, of contamination or possible cleanup. Accordingly, no accrual has been made
for remediation in the accompanying Condensed Financial Statements. Results of
this investigation are expected to be available in 1995. If this site were
required to be remediated, industry studies show MISSISSIPPI could incur cleanup
costs ranging from $1.5 million to $10 million before giving consideration to
possible recovery of clean-up costs from other parties.

                      SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations

Earnings
SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
of 1995 showed little change from prior year's second quarter, while
year-to-date 1995 dropped $1.5 million. The decrease in net income was primarily
due to higher operation, maintenance and depreciation expenses and lower
construction related credits, reflecting the commercial operation of two
combustion turbine units in the 1994 periods.

Revenues
Revenues for the second quarter of 1995 rose slightly over the corresponding
period in 1994, due to higher retail energy sales. When compared to prior year,
retail energy sales increased 11.3% in the second quarter and 6.4% year-to-date
because of weather influences, an increase in the number of customers served and
higher demand from industrial customers. Industrial energy sales were higher
primarily because a major customer performed maintenance on its cogeneration
facility in the first and second quarters of 1995. The replacement energy was
purchased under a rate schedule that has a small profit margin and, thus, had
little impact on earnings. Wholesale energy sales to non-affiliated companies
decreased; however, only the capacity revenues of such sales have any measurable
effect on earnings. Capacity revenues fell approximately $110,000 for each
quarter of 1995, compared to the corresponding quarters in the prior year.

Expenses
Despite a decrease in the average cost of fuel consumed, fuel expenses increased
during the second quarter and year-to-date 1995, compared to those recorded in
1994, because of higher generation. Fuel costs in 1994 spiked because of
increases in the cost of fuel in the spot market due to the coal miners' strike
and higher freight charges. The increase in generation was due to demand in
SAVANNAH's service area and elsewhere in the Southeast. Purchased power
transactions among the affiliated companies within the Southern electric system
will vary from period to period depending on demand and the availability and
variable cost of generating resources at each company. These transactions do not
have a significant impact on earnings. Other operation expenses for the second
quarter and year-to-date 1995 increased over the corresponding periods in 1994
for a variety of reasons including employee compensation and consulting costs
for training and increased expenses related to demand side option programs. The
change in maintenance expense reflects unscheduled precipitator maintenance
performed at Plant McIntosh. Depreciation and amortization reflected the
commercial operation of two combustion turbine peaking units in April and May
1994. Income taxes were lower because of the change in taxable income.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under construction
and is included in rate base. The equity portion of AFUDC represents non-cash
income. When facilities are completed and included in rate base, previously
capitalized amounts increase cash flow because revenues are higher as

Results of Operations  (Continued)

a result of the increased rate base and additional depreciation expense. The
amount of AFUDC recorded in 1994 was higher because of SAVANNAH's investment in
the construction of two 80 megawatt combustion turbine peaking units.

Future Earnings Potential
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from growth in energy sales to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
increased costs cannot be offset. The Clean Air Act is discussed under
"Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
SAVANNAH's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors. Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, and the rate of economic growth in SAVANNAH's service area. The
enactment of the Energy Act is beginning to have a dramatic effect on the
electric utility industry. A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy
Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SAVANNAH's 1994
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     SAVANNAH is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a portion of
the company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, SAVANNAH
would be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities. See
Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of SAVANNAH's 1994 Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information.

     In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This
statement requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. This statement also imposes stricter criteria for
regulatory assets by requiring that such assets be probable of future recovery
at each balance sheet date. SAVANNAH anticipates adopting this standard by
January 1, 1996 and does not expect that adoption will have a material impact on
the financial position or results of operations of SAVANNAH based on the current
regulatory structure in which SAVANNAH operates. This conclusion may change in
the future as competitive factors influence wholesale and retail pricing in this
industry.

                      SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Financial Condition

Overview
During the first half of 1995, SAVANNAH made gross property additions to utility
plant of $14.0 million. The funds for these additions and other capital
requirements came from operating activities, principally from earnings and
noncash charges to income such as depreciation. See the Condensed Statements of
Cash Flows for further details.

Capital Requirements for Construction
SAVANNAH's construction program is budgeted at $87 million for the three years
1995 through 1997 ($34 million in 1995, $27 million in 1996 and $26 million in
1997). Actual construction costs may vary from this estimate because of such
factors as changes in business conditions; changes in environmental regulations;
the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; revised
load growth estimates and changes in cost of capital. Such construction
expenditures will be incurred for transmission and distribution facilities and
the upgrading and extension of the useful lives of generating plants.

     Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the
Southern electric system's capital requirements and operating costs. The acid
rain compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will impact the Southern electric
system. This legislation, as well as other legislation and regulations, are
described under "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in SAVANNAH's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The full impact of these
requirements cannot be determined at this time, pending the development and
implementation of applicable regulations. There can be no assurance that
compliance costs will be recovered through corresponding increases in rates.

Sources of Capital
At June 30, 1995, SAVANNAH had $29.5 million of unused credit arrangements with
banks to meet its short-term cash needs. SAVANNAH had $1.0 million of short-term
debt outstanding at quarter-end. Additionally, SAVANNAH has $1.0 million of
capitalized leases maturing by June 30, 1996. SAVANNAH has received the
authority from the SEC to have outstanding at any one time an amount of up to
$70 million in short-term borrowings.

     It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be derived
from operations and the sale of additional first mortgage bonds and preferred
stock and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. SAVANNAH is required to meet
certain coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate
charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. SAVANNAH's
coverage ratios are sufficiently high to permit, at present interest and
dividend rate levels, any foreseeable security sales. The amount of securities
which SAVANNAH will be permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market
conditions and other factors prevailing at that time.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)   Reference is made to Item 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS in the SOUTHERN system's
      combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994
      for a description of the proceedings related to a derivative action filed
      against certain current and former directors and officers of SOUTHERN. In
      June 1995, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia,
      on remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, granted
      the motion for summary judgment filed on behalf of the defendant directors
      and officers. The plaintiffs have again appealed to the Eleventh Circuit
      Court.

(B)   Reference is made to Note 3 to each of the registrant's, except
      SAVANNAH's, notes to the financial statements in Item 8 in the SOUTHERN
      system's combined 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the
      proceedings initiated by the FERC regarding the reasonableness of the
      return on common equity on certain of the Southern electric system's
      wholesale rate schedules and contracts.

(C)   Certain of the registrants and SCS, the system service company, instituted
      workforce reduction programs. The expenses recognized and the unamortized
      balance of deferred expenses under these programs were as follows: (in

(D)   In September 1990, two customers of ALABAMA filed a civil complaint in the
      Circuit Court of Shelby County, Alabama, against ALABAMA seeking to
      represent all persons who, prior to June 23, 1989, entered into agreements
      with ALABAMA for the financing of heat pumps and other merchandise
      purchased from vendors other than ALABAMA. The plaintiffs contended that
      ALABAMA was required to obtain a license under the Alabama Consumer
      Finance Act to engage in the business of making consumer loans. The
      plaintiffs were seeking an order declaring these agreements null and void
      and requiring ALABAMA to refund all payments, principal and interest,

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)

      made under these agreements. The aggregate amount under these agreements,
      together with interest paid, currently is estimated to be $40 million.

         In June 1993, the court ordered ALABAMA to refund or forfeit interest
      because of ALABAMA's failure to obtain such license. However, the court's
      order did not require any refund or forfeiture with respect to any
      principal payments under the agreements at issue. In May 1995, the Supreme
      Court of Alabama affirmed the order of the Circuit Court. The case has now
      been remanded to the trial court for implementation of the order. ALABAMA
      recorded a charge of $9 million in "Other Income (Expense)" to cover the
      refund subject to final resolution of this matter.

(E)   On June 12, 1995, the Alabama PSC issued an order granting ALABAMA's
      request for gradual adjustments to move toward parity among rate classes.
      This order also calls for a moratorium on retail rate increases (but not
      decreases) until July 2001, under the retail ratemaking procedure that
      provides for periodic adjustments based upon ALABAMA's earned return on
      end-of-period retail common equity.

(F)  Pursuant to orders from the Georgia PSC, GEORGIA deferred financing and
     depreciation costs under phase-in plans for Plant Vogtle units 1 and 2
     until the allowed investment was fully reflected in rates as of October
     1991. In addition, the Georgia PSC issued two separate accounting orders
     that required GEORGIA to defer substantially all operating and financing
     costs related to both units until rate orders addressed these costs. The
     Georgia PSC orders provide for recovery of deferred costs within 10 years.
     The Georgia PSC also ordered GEORGIA to levelize declining capacity
     buyback expense from the co-owners of the plant over a six-year period
     beginning October 1991. The unamortized balance of these deferred costs at
     June 30, 1995, was $374 million.

(G)   Reference is made to Note 4 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report on
      Form 10-K for information concerning the uncertainty related to the
      actions of regulatory authorities with respect to the recovery of costs of
      the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project. The ultimate
      outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

(H)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report on
      Form 10-K for information regarding recovery of GEORGIA's costs from
      demand-side conservation programs. On August 7, 1995, the Georgia PSC
      ordered GEORGIA to discontinue the current demand-side conservation
      programs by the end of 1995. The rate riders will continue in effect until
      costs deferred are collected, not to exceed an $80 million cap as of
      December 31, 1995. In July 1995, GEORGIA recognized expenses of
      approximately $22 million for previously deferred costs which will not be
      recovered under the riders and costs expected to be incurred in excess of
      the capped amount.

(I)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report
      on Form 10-K for information

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)

      regarding a tax deficiency notice received from the Internal Revenue
      Service relating to GEORGIA's tax accounting for the sale in 1984 of an
      interest in Plant Vogtle and related capacity and energy buyback
      commitments. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined;
      however, in management's opinion, the final outcome will not have a
      material adverse effect on SOUTHERN's or GEORGIA's Condensed Financial
      Statements.

(J)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item
      8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for
      information regarding joint complaints filed by OPC and MEAG seeking
      recovery from GEORGIA for alleged partial requirements rates overcharges
      plus interest. In July 1995, the FERC denied OPC's and MEAG's request for
      a rehearing with respect to this matter. While the outcome of this matter
      cannot now be determined, in management's opinion, it will not have a
      material adverse effect on GEORGIA's Condensed Financial Statements.

(K)   Reference is made to Note 3 and Note 4 to the financial statements of
      SOUTHERN and GEORGIA, respectively, in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's
      combined 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on certain
      environmental contingencies.
