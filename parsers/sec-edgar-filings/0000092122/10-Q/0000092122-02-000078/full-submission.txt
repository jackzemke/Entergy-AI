           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

     This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking and historical

terminology such as "may," "would," "will," "could," "should," "expects,"
"plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "projects," "predicts,"
"potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable
terminology. SOUTHERN cautions that there are various important factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements; accordingly, there can be no assurance that such
indicated results will be realized. These factors include the impact of recent
and future federal and state regulatory change, including legislative and
regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the electric
utility industry and also changes in environmental and other laws and
regulations to which SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries are subject, as well as
changes in application of existing laws and regulations; current and future
litigation, including the pending EPA civil action against certain SOUTHERN
subsidiaries; the effect, extent and timing of the entry of additional
competition in the markets in which SOUTHERN's subsidiaries operate; the impact
of fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and customer demand; state
and federal rate regulations; political, legal and economic conditions and
developments in the United States; the performance of projects undertaken by the
non-traditional business and the success of efforts to invest in and develop new
opportunities; internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may be
pursued; potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions
of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial
to SOUTHERN or its subsidiaries; the ability of counterparties of SOUTHERN and
its subsidiaries to make payments as and when due; the effects of, and changes
in, economic conditions in the areas in which SOUTHERN's subsidiaries operate;
the direct and indirect effects on SOUTHERN's business resulting from the
terrorist incidents on September 11, 2001, or any similar such incidents or

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   THIRD QUARTER 2002 vs. THIRD QUARTER 2001
                                       AND
                     YEAR-TO-DATE 2002 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 2001


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SOUTHERN is focusing on three main businesses in the
Southeast: its traditional business, represented by its five operating companies
providing electric service in four states; a growing competitive generation
business in the Super Southeast; and energy-related products and services for
its retail customers.

Earnings

SOUTHERN's third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 earnings from
continuing operations were $595 million ($0.84 per share) and $1.15 billion
($1.63 per share), respectively, compared with $554 million ($0.80 per share)
and $1.0 billion ($1.46 per share) in the third quarter 2001 and year-to-date
2001. The increases in earnings for the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002
are due to several positive factors, including increased demand for electricity,
continued customer growth, solid performance by the competitive generation
business, lower interest rates and the overall impact of regulatory rate
proceedings in Alabama, Florida and Mississippi, partially offset by the impact
of higher operating expenses in the third quarter 2002 associated with new
generation units that have come on line in the past year, start-up costs at
Southern Gas during the third quarter 2002 and the impact on the energy services
business from the manufacturing industry's downturn. Warmer weather in the third
quarter 2002 as compared to unusually mild temperatures in 2001 caused the
increased demand for energy. In July 2002, SOUTHERN raised its annual dividend
by 3 cents to $1.37 per share, or $0.3425 per quarter.

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue was up by $135 million, or 7.4%, in the third
quarter 2002 and $194 million, or 4.2%, year-to-date 2002 when compared to the
corresponding periods in the prior year. Energy sales to residential, commercial
and industrial customers for the third quarter 2002 increased by 9.1%, 3.5% and
3.0%, respectively, as compared to the

comparable reporting period in 2001. For year-to-date 2002 as compared to 2001,
energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers increased by
6.8%, 2.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Warmer weather and customer growth
significantly impacted energy sales to these customers in both the third quarter
2002 and year-to-date 2002 when compared to the same periods in the prior year.
Although retail energy sales to industrial customers increased slightly in 2002
when compared to corresponding periods in 2001, overall sales to industrial
customers remain depressed due to the continuing effect of sluggish economic
conditions.

     Sales for resale. The third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 decreases
are primarily attributed to reduced energy sales to these customers when
compared to the same periods in 2001.

     Other revenues. The third quarter 2002 increase in other revenues, when
compared to the same period in 2001, is primarily attributed to revenues of
$10.6 million from Southern Gas and $9.2 million in revenues from subscribers of
SOUTHERN's wireless communications subsidiary. In the third quarter 2002,
however, these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenues from
other subsidiaries. Beginning August 1, 2002, Southern Gas' results of
operations are included in SOUTHERN's consolidated financial statements. The
year-to-date 2002 increase reflects increased revenues of $25.3 million from
subscribers of SOUTHERN's wireless communications subsidiary and increased
revenues from the operations of a subsidiary formed in April 2001 that provides
services related to alternative fuel products.

     Fuel expense. During the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002, fuel
expense increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year due to a
number of factors. These factors include three new combined-cycle generating
plants (Plant Franklin Unit 1 and Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7) placed into
service in June 2002 by SOUTHERN POWER, another generating unit (Plant Smith
Unit 3) placed into service in April 2002 by GULF and higher unit costs for
natural gas.

     Purchased power expense. Throughout the SOUTHERN system, an additional
2,279 megawatts of generation has been placed into commercial operation during
2002, which resulted in decreases for the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date
2002 in purchased power expense. Since energy expenses are usually offset by
energy revenues through the operating companies' cost recovery mechanisms, these
expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operations expense. During the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date
2002, other operations expense increased primarily due to increased
administrative and general expenses and, to a lesser extent, increased fossil
steam production.

     Depreciation and amortization. The overall decrease is primarily a result
of GEORGIA's discontinuing accelerated depreciation and beginning amortization
of the regulatory liability for accelerated cost recovery in January 2002 in
accordance with its new retail rate order. For the third quarter 2002 and
year-to-date 2002, the decrease in depreciation and amortization related to
GEORGIA amounted to $38.2 million and $145.1 million, respectively. Reference is
made to Note (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein.
These decreases were partially offset by the initiation of depreciation on
property placed in service during the year, including the four generating units
referred to previously.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Equity in losses of subsidiaries. The third quarter 2002 and year-to-date
2002 increases when compared to the same periods in 2001 are primarily
attributed to SOUTHERN's investments in partnerships producing alternative fuel
products. SOUTHERN formed a new subsidiary in April 2001 to hold its investment
in a partnership producing alternative fuel products.

     Other, net. For the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002, the decrease
in this item is attributed to mark to market adjustments for derivative energy
contracts as required by FASB Statement No. 133, higher non-utility expenses in
the current period and gains on property sales recorded in the same periods in
2001. Further contributing to these decreases in 2002 are expenses related to a
new electricity pricing program. See "Exposure to Market Risks" herein for
additional information on derivative energy contracts.

     Interest expense, net. For the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002,
interest expense, net decreased primarily due to a reduction in interest rates
compared to the same periods in 2001. SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries engage in
new external financing for refunding purposes and to finance ongoing
construction programs.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors. The two major factors are the ability of the operating companies to
achieve energy sales growth while containing costs in a more competitive
environment and the profitability of the new competitive market-based wholesale
generating facilities being added. For additional information relating to the
other businesses, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Southern Power" and "Other Business"
in the Form 10-K.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Also, reference is made to Note (B) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for information relating to the spin off of Mirant
from SOUTHERN, including Mirant's recent Form 10-Q filings describing, among
other things, certain accounting errors identified for the period January 1,
1999 through June 30, 2002. Mirant announced that it has requested its
independent auditors to reaudit Mirant's 2000 and 2001 financial statements to
address the accounting errors identified during its review and to comply with
certain new accounting standards. If Mirant's reaudit results in adjustments
that relate to periods prior to the spin off, SOUTHERN's earnings from
discontinued operations and net assets of discontinued operations could be
affected. Because any such adjustments would only relate to operations
discontinued by SOUTHERN, they would have no effect on SOUTHERN's 2002 earnings
or its future earnings potential, financial position, liquidity or cash flows.
Based on the nature and amount of Mirant's identified accounting errors,
SOUTHERN's management does not currently anticipate that a reaudit of SOUTHERN's
2000 and 2001 financial statements will be necessary.

     SOUTHERN's business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has
increased generally throughout the United States; in particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to

hazardous materials have become more frequent. Although the ultimate outcome of
such litigation currently filed against SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries cannot be
predicted at this time, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if
any, arising from such proceedings would have a material adverse effect on
SOUTHERN's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, including the EPA litigation, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the
financial statements of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K. On November 4, 2002, the U.S.
District Court in Alabama extended the stay of the EPA litigation proceeding in
Alabama until the earlier of February 4, 2003 or a ruling by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the related litigation involving TVA.

     On April 25, 2002, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee met and selected the
candidates that will be considered for the SeTrans ISA. On June 27, 2002,
SOUTHERN and other SeTrans sponsors submitted a Petition for Declaratory Order
seeking the FERC's approval of the SeTrans governance structure and the
selection process for the ISA, as well as guidance on various issues. The FERC
granted the petition on October 10, 2002, approving the governance structure and
the selection process for the ISA. The FERC also provided guidance on other
issues identified in the petition. On November 1, 2002, the SeTrans sponsors
announced that they had selected the team of ESB International, Ltd. ("ESBI")
and Accenture LLP as the preferred candidate for the ISA. Should negotiations
with this candidate successfully conclude with final agreement among the
parties, the sponsors intend to seek any regulatory or other approvals necessary
for formation of the SeTrans RTO and the approval of ESBI/Accenture to serve in
the capacity of SeTrans ISA. Reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Certain
Factors Affecting the Industry" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Industry Restructuring" for each of the registrants in the Form 10-K
for additional information.

     In June 2002, SOUTHERN formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Southern Gas.
Southern Gas operates as a retail gas marketer in the State of Georgia. On July
19, 2002, Southern Gas completed its acquisition out of bankruptcy from The New
Power Company ("New Power") of approximately 210,000 retail natural gas
customers located in the State of Georgia, representing a 15% market share.
Southern Gas also purchased from New Power proprietary risk management software
and hardware systems, natural gas inventory and accounts receivable. The total
purchase price was approximately $60 million. Beginning August 1, 2002, Southern
Gas' results of operations are included in SOUTHERN's consolidated financial
statements.

     On July 31, 2002, the FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled
"Remedying Undue Discrimination Through Open Access Transmission Service and
Standard Electricity Market Design." The FERC has indicated that the proposal,
if adopted, would (among other things): (i) require transmission assets of
jurisdictional utilities to be operated by an independent entity; (ii) establish
a standard market design; (iii) establish a single type of transmission service
that applies to all customers; (iv) assert jurisdiction over the transmission
component of bundled retail service; (v) establish a generation reserve margin;
(vi) establish bid caps for day-ahead and spot energy markets; and (vii) revise
the FERC policy on the pricing of transmission expansions. The FERC has revised
the comment schedule such that comments on certain issues are due on November
15, 2002 and comments on other issues are due on January 10, 2003. Reply
comments are due on February 17, 2003. Any impact of this proposal on SOUTHERN
and its subsidiaries will depend on the form in which final rules may be
ultimately adopted.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Reference is made to Note 5 to SOUTHERN's financial statements in the Form
10-K, regarding Long-Term Power Sales Agreements. MISSISSIPPI and SOUTHERN POWER
have capacity sale contracts with subsidiaries of Dynegy Inc. ("Dynegy"). Dynegy
is currently experiencing liquidity problems and has had its credit rating
reduced below investment grade. Minimum capacity revenues under these contracts
average approximately $13 million annually through May 2005 for SOUTHERN POWER
and $21 million annually for MISSISSIPPI through May 2011. Dynegy has provided
letters of credit expiring in February 2003 totaling $20 million (approximately
18 months of capacity payments) to SOUTHERN POWER and $26 million (approximately
15 months of capacity payments) to MISSISSIPPI. In addition, two one-year
letters of credit totaling $50 million (approximately 14 months of capacity
payments) were provided in April 2002 as security for obligations of affiliates
of Dynegy under the Plant Franklin Unit 3 PPA beginning in 2005. These letters
of credit can be drawn in the event of (a) a default under the PPA or (b)
failure to renew the letters of credit prior to expiration. In the event of such
a default, and if MISSISSIPPI and SOUTHERN POWER were unable to resell that
capacity in the market, future earnings could be affected. The outcome cannot
now be determined.

     Reference is made to the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements"
herein for discussion of various contingencies and other matters which may
affect future earnings potential. Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 -
"Legal Proceedings" herein. Reference is also made to Note (E) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for information relating to a
subpoena received by SOUTHERN from the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California and to certain lawsuits regarding the installation of
fiber optic cable over existing easements of certain SOUTHERN subsidiaries.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policies

SOUTHERN's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. SOUTHERN's only
critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. The operating companies are
subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a portion of a company's
operations is no longer subject to these provisions, the company would be
required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
specifically recoverable and determine if any other assets, including plant,
have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset Retirement Obligations,"
which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with retiring assets, including decommissioning nuclear plants. The
liability for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in the period in
which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as part of the
related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. Changes
in the liability resulting from the passage of time will be recognized as
operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by January 1, 2003.
SOUTHERN is currently assessing the impact of adopting Statement No. 143 on its
financial statements. Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of
SOUTHERN under "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form
10-K.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146, "Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities."  Statement No. 146 requires
that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized and measured initially at fair value when the liability is incurred.
Disposal activities which are addressed in Statement No. 146 include the
termination benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily
terminated, costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease and costs
to consolidate facilities or relocate employees.  Statement No. 146 is
effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December 31, 2002.  SOUTHERN does not expect that adoption of Statement No. 146
will have a material impact on its financial statements.

     Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item
8 of the Form 10-K regarding SOUTHERN's adoption of FASB Statement No.133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.
Recent accounting changes have been issued by the Emerging Issues Task Force
("EITF") of the FASB. These changes will require certain energy trading
contracts that are currently marked to market to be accounted for under the
accrual basis. These changes will also require certain trading activities to be
recorded on a net basis for income statement presentation. The new rules will be
effective January 1, 2003. SOUTHERN is in the process of determining the impact
of this recently issued guidance. However, in many cases, SOUTHERN's current
transactions meet the normal purchases and sale exception under FASB Statement
No. 133 and are already accounted for under the accrual basis.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first nine months of
2002 included $2.0 billion used for gross property additions to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were primarily
obtained from issuances of senior notes. See SOUTHERN's Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In May 2001, MISSISSIPPI began the initial 10-year term of an operating lease
agreement signed in 1999 with Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership
("Escatawpa"), a special purpose entity, to use a combined-cycle generating
facility located at MISSISSIPPI's Plant Daniel. The facility cost approximately
$370 million. The lease provides for a residual value guarantee -- approximately
71% of the completion cost -- by MISSISSIPPI that is due upon termination of the
lease in certain circumstances. Reference is made to Note 9 to the financial
statements in Item 8 of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K and Note 4 to the financial
statements in Item 8 of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K for additional information.
In June 2002, the FASB issued an exposure draft for comment on a proposed
interpretation on "Consolidation of Certain Special-Purpose Entities," an
interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. It is expected that the
exposure draft would be finalized by year end, with an effective date for
existing transactions subject to the interpretation, including MISSISSIPPI's
lease transaction, to be implemented on April 1, 2003. This interpretation is in
draft form; the final pronouncement may differ from the draft. However, in its
current draft form, MISSISSIPPI would be deemed to be the "primary beneficiary"
of its lease arrangement with Escatawpa and would be required to consolidate the
leased asset and related debt on its books or to restructure the existing
arrangement to comply with the final rules. Until final rules are approved by
the FASB, MISSISSIPPI will continue to analyze the

impact of the exposure draft. MISSISSIPPI's current operating lease arrangement
with Escatawpa has been reviewed and approved by the Mississippi PSC and is
reflected and approved for recovery in both its retail and wholesale rate
jurisdictions. Consolidation of the leased asset and related debt could require
MISSISSIPPI to seek additional regulatory review.

     In 2001, SOUTHERN POWER entered into a financial arrangement with
Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale ("WestLB") whereby SOUTHERN POWER could
assign up to $125 million in vendor contracts for equipment to WestLB. For
accounting purposes, WestLB was the owner of the contracts. SOUTHERN POWER acted
as an agent for WestLB and instructed WestLB when to make payments to the
vendors. SOUTHERN POWER terminated this arrangement and reacquired these assets
in March 2002 for their original cost of $61 million.

Credit Rating Risk

SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries do not have any credit agreements that would
require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a
credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts that could require
collateral -- but not accelerated payment -- in the event of a credit rating
change to below investment grade. These contracts are primarily for physical
electricity sales, fixed-price physical gas purchases and agreements covering
interest rate swaps and currency swaps. At September 30, 2002, the maximum
potential collateral requirements under the electricity sale contracts and
financial instrument agreements were approximately $422 million. Generally,
collateral may be provided for by a SOUTHERN guaranty, letter of credit or cash.
At September 30, 2002, there were no material collateral requirements for the
gas purchase contracts.

Exposure to Market Risks

SOUTHERN's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the December 31, 2001 reporting period. In
addition, SOUTHERN is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, the operating companies have limited
exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and
prices of electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in
electricity prices, the operating companies and SOUTHERN POWER enter into fixed
price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market and, to a lesser extent, similar contracts for gas purchases.
Also, the operating companies, with the exception of GEORGIA, have implemented
fuel-hedging programs at the instruction of their respective PSCs. The fair
value of derivative energy contracts at September 30, 2002 is as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to the PSC-approved fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory
assets and liabilities. Realized gains and losses from these programs are
included in fuel expense and are recovered through the operating companies' fuel
cost recovery clauses. In addition, unrealized gains and losses on electric and
gas contracts used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales are deferred in
Other Comprehensive Income. Gains and losses on contracts that do not represent
hedges are recognized in the Statements of Income as incurred.

     At September 30, 2002, the fair value of derivative energy contracts totals
$41.0 million which consists of $30.3 million in regulatory liabilities, $8.1
million deferred in Other Comprehensive Income and $2.6 million recognized in
income. The $30.3 million in regulatory liabilities relates to unrealized gains
on mark to market derivative contracts associated with the fuel hedging programs
of the operating companies with the exception of GEORGIA. The $8.1 million
deferred in Other Comprehensive Income relates to cash flow hedges for gas and
power contracts for SOUTHERN POWER and Southern Gas. The $2.6 million recognized
in income relates to gas and power contracts for the operating companies,
SOUTHERN POWER and Southern Gas. For the quarters ended September 30, 2002 and
2001, approximately $2.2 million and $20.0 million, respectively, of gains were
recognized in income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and 2001,
approximately $(3.9) million and $15.8 million, respectively, of gains (losses)
were recognized in income. SOUTHERN is exposed to market price risk in the event
of nonperformance by the parties to the derivative energy contracts. SOUTHERN's
policy is to enter into agreements with counterparties that have investment
grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P; therefore SOUTHERN does not anticipate
nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, reference is
made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Market Price Risk" of
SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K, Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in
Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements for Construction," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for a description of the SOUTHERN system's
capital requirements for its construction program, sinking fund requirements,
maturing debt and environmental compliance efforts. Approximately $992 million
will be required by September 30, 2003 for redemptions and maturities of
long-term debt. Also, SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries plan to continue, to the
extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and replace these
securities with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital over the next several years. The amounts and
timing of additional equity capital to be raised will be contingent on
SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The operating companies and SOUTHERN POWER

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from internal
sources and by the issuances of new debt and preferred equity securities, term
loans and short-term borrowings. However, the amount, type and timing of any
financings -- if needed -- will depend upon market conditions and regulatory
approval. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for
additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
September 30, 2002 approximately $293 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $4.7 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks, of which
$228 million expire in 2002 and $3.5 billion expire in 2003 and $978 million
expire in 2004 and beyond. Of the facilities maturing in 2002 and 2003, $2.8
billion contain provisions allowing two-year term loans executable at the
expiration date. These unused credit arrangements also provide liquidity support
to variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper programs. The
operating companies may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible
commercial notes at the request and for the benefit of each of the operating
companies. At September 30, 2002, the SOUTHERN system had extendible commercial
notes outstanding of $70 million, short-term notes payable outstanding of $37
million and commercial paper outstanding of $1.1 billion. Management believes
that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of
credit without maintaining large cash balances.

(a)      Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

Within 90 days of the filing date of this quarterly report, SOUTHERN, the
operating companies and SOUTHERN POWER conducted separate evaluations under the
supervision and with the participation of each company's management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Sections 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon those evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer, in each case, concluded that the disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to
material information relating to each company (including its consolidated
subsidiaries) required to be included in periodic filings with the SEC.

(b)      Changes in internal controls.

None.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    THIRD QUARTER 2002 vs. THIRD QUARTER 2001
                                       AND
                     YEAR-TO-DATE 2002 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 2001


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter
2002 and year-to-date 2002 was $200.7 million and $388.9 million, respectively,
compared to $179.5 million and $324.9 million for the corresponding periods of
2001. The increase in earnings for both periods is primarily attributed to
increased territorial sales and retail rates when compared to the corresponding
periods in the prior year. More favorable weather conditions in the third
quarter of 2002 and year-to-date 2002 as compared to the unusually mild weather
experienced in the comparable periods in 2001 contributed to these increases in
territorial sales. The increases in revenues were offset by increased non-fuel
operating expenses in the third quarter of 2002 when compared to the third
quarter of 2001.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

         Retail sales. Excluding energy cost recovery revenues, which generally
do not affect net income, retail sales revenue was higher by $69.1 million, or
11%, for the third quarter 2002 and $144.9 million, or 9.1%, year-to-date 2002
when compared to the corresponding periods in 2001. Energy sales to residential
and commercial customers increased by 9.8% and 6.1% and by 6.6% and 3.9%,
respectively, for the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 as compared to
the corresponding periods of 2001 primarily due to more favorable weather
conditions in 2002. Although retail energy sales to industrial customers
increased slightly in 2002 when compared to the previous reporting periods,
overall sales to industrial customers remain depressed due to the continuing
effect of sluggish economic conditions within Alabama.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. For both reporting periods above, the
demand for energy by non-affiliates was lower when compared to the same periods
in 2001. These transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings since
the energy is usually sold at variable cost.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies within the SOUTHERN system, as
well as purchases of energy, will vary depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These transactions did not
have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. In the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002, other
revenues decreased because revenues from gas-fueled cogeneration steam
facilities were lower when compared to the corresponding periods in 2001
primarily due to lower demand. Since cogeneration steam revenues are generally
offset by fuel expenses, these revenues did not have a significant impact on
earnings.

     Fuel expense. The decrease in fuel expense during the third quarter of 2002
when compared to the same period in 2001 was primarily attributed to a lower
price for fossil fuels. The year-to-date 2002 decrease in fuel expense from 2001
is due to lower natural gas prices during part of 2002 and lower fossil fuel
prices in 2002. Since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues,
these expenses did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. In the third quarter 2002 and
year-to-date 2002, purchased power from non-affiliates when compared to the
corresponding periods in 2001 decreased due to lower costs associated with these
energy purchases and the utilization of electricity within the SOUTHERN system
when compared to the corresponding periods in 2001. Throughout the SOUTHERN
system, an additional 2,279 megawatts of generation has been placed into
commercial operation during 2002. These expenses do not have a significant
impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues
through ALABAMA's energy cost recovery clause.

     Other operation expense. The third quarter 2002 expense increased over the
same period for 2001 primarily due to a lower accrual in 2001 related to
incentive pay and to reduced administrative and general expense associated with
an environmental insurance refund in 2001. In addition to the items above, the
year-to-date 2002 expense increased over the year-to-date 2001 expense due to
increased miscellaneous steam expense and increased property insurance expense
in 2002.

     Maintenance expense. Maintenance expense increased during the third quarter
2002 when compared to the same period in 2001 due largely to higher costs in
2002 related to distribution line maintenance and a nuclear expense reduction in
2001. The year-to-date 2002 decrease in this expense is primarily due to a
reduction in maintenance on transmission and distribution lines.

     Depreciation and amortization. During the third quarter 2002 and
year-to-date 2002, depreciation and amortization was higher as a result of
increased utility plant when compared to the corresponding periods in 2001.

     Other, net. The decrease in the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 is
attributed primarily to mark to market adjustments for derivative energy
contracts and an increase in non-utility expenses when compared to the
corresponding periods in the prior year. See "Exposure to Market Risks" herein
for additional information related to derivative energy contracts.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Interest expense, net. The third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002
decreases in these expenses when compared to the corresponding periods in 2001
are mainly due to lower interest rates on outstanding long-term debt and notes
payable.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, ALABAMA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in the Form
10-K.

     ALABAMA's business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has
increased generally throughout the United States; in particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. Although the ultimate outcome of such litigation currently filed
against ALABAMA cannot be predicted at this time, management does not anticipate
that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a
material adverse effect on ALABAMA's financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, including the EPA litigation, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the
financial statements of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K. On November 4, 2002, the U.S.
District Court in Alabama extended the stay of the EPA litigation proceeding in
Alabama until the earlier of February 4, 2003 or a ruling by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the related litigation involving TVA.

     On April 25, 2002, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee met and selected the
candidates that will be considered for the SeTrans ISA. On June 27, 2002,
SOUTHERN and other SeTrans sponsors submitted a Petition for Declaratory Order
seeking the FERC's approval of the SeTrans governance structure and the
selection process for the ISA, as well as guidance on various issues. The FERC
granted the petition on October 10, 2002, approving the governance structure and
the selection process for the ISA. The FERC also provided guidance on other
issues identified in the petition. On November 1, 2002, the SeTrans sponsors
announced that they had selected the team of ESB International, Ltd. ("ESBI")
and Accenture LLP as the preferred candidate for the ISA. Should negotiations
with this candidate successfully conclude with final agreement among the
parties, the sponsors intend to seek any regulatory or other approvals necessary
for formation of the SeTrans RTO and the approval of ESBI/Accenture to serve in
the capacity of SeTrans ISA. Reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Certain
Factors Affecting the Industry" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Industry Restructuring" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K for additional

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     On July 31, 2002, the FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled
"Remedying Undue Discrimination Through Open Access Transmission Service and
Standard Electricity Market Design." The FERC has indicated that the proposal,
if adopted, would (among other things): (i) require transmission assets of
jurisdictional utilities to be operated by an independent entity; (ii) establish
a standard market design; (iii) establish a single type of transmission service
that applies to all customers; (iv) assert jurisdiction over the transmission
component of bundled retail service; (v) establish a generation reserve margin;
(vi) establish bid caps for day-ahead and spot energy markets; and (vii) revise
the FERC policy on the pricing of transmission expansions. The FERC has revised
the comment schedule such that comments on certain issues are due on November
15, 2002 and comments on other issues are due on January 10, 2003. Reply
comments are due on February 17, 2003. Any impact of this proposal on SOUTHERN
and its subsidiaries will depend on the form in which final rules may be
ultimately adopted.

     Reference is made to Notes (C) through (E), (G), (N) and (Q) in the "Notes
to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

ALABAMA's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. ALABAMA's only
critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. ALABAMA is subject to the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation." In the event that a portion of ALABAMA's operations is no
longer subject to these provisions, ALABAMA would be required to write off
related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
and determine if any other assets, including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset Retirement Obligations,"
which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with retiring assets, including decommissioning nuclear plants. The
liability for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in the period in
which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as part of the
related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. Changes
in the liability resulting from the passage of time will be recognized as
operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by January 1, 2003.
ALABAMA is currently assessing the impact of adopting Statement No. 143 on its
financial statements. Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of
ALABAMA under "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form
10-K.

     In July 2002,  the FASB issued  Statement  No. 146,  "Accounting  for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities."  Statement No. 146 requires that a
liability for costs  associated with an exit or disposal  activity be recognized
and measured  initially at fair value when the  liability is incurred.  Disposal
activities  which are  addressed  in Statement  No. 146 include the  termination
benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated,  costs
to  terminate a contract  that is not a capital  lease and costs to  consolidate
facilities  or relocate  employees.  Statement  No. 146 is effective for exit or
disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. ALABAMA does not
expect that  adoption of  Statement  No. 146 will have a material  impact on its
financial statements.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of ALABAMA in Item
8 of the Form 10-K regarding ALABAMA's adoption of FASB Statement No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.
Recent accounting changes have been issued by the Emerging Issues Task Force
("EITF") of the FASB. These changes will require certain energy trading
contracts that are currently marked to market to be accounted for under the
accrual basis. These changes will also require certain trading activities to be
recorded on a net basis for income statement presentation. The new rules will be
effective January 1, 2003. ALABAMA is in the process of determining the impact
of this recently issued guidance. However, in many cases, ALABAMA's current
transactions meet the normal purchases and sale exception under FASB Statement
No. 133 and are already accounted for under the accrual basis.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first nine months of
2002 included the addition of approximately $475 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Credit Rating Risk

ALABAMA does not have any credit agreements that would require material changes
in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

ALABAMA's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the December 31, 2001 reporting period. In
addition, ALABAMA is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, ALABAMA has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity.
To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, ALABAMA
enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity
through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, similar
contracts for gas purchases. ALABAMA has also implemented a retail fuel hedging
program at the instruction of its PSC. The fair value of derivative energy
contracts at September 30, 2002 is as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to the retail fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets
and liabilities. At September 30, 2002, ALABAMA had approximately $20.0 million
in regulatory liabilities related to unrealized gains on mark to market
derivative contracts associated with its fuel hedging programs. Realized gains
and losses from these programs are included in fuel expense and are recovered
through ALABAMA's fuel cost recovery clause. Gains and losses on contracts that
do not represent hedges are recognized in the Statements of Income as incurred.
For the quarters ended September 30, 2002 and 2001, approximately $0.3 million
and $6.0 million, respectively, of gains were recognized in income. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2002 and 2001, approximately $(2.0) million and $3.3
million, respectively, of gains (losses) were recognized in income.

     For additional information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S

Financing Activities

In June 2002, ALABAMA issued $350 million of Series P Floating Rate Senior Notes
due December 29, 2003. The proceeds from the sale were used to redeem, in July
2002, $345.5 million aggregate principal amount of its First Mortgage Bonds,
7.75% Series due February 1, 2023, 7.45% Series due July 1, 2023 and 7.30%
Series due November 1, 2023. At the time of the issuance of these Senior Notes,
ALABAMA entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the floating rate at
3.015%. Reference is made to Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information relating to derivative
instruments.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In October 2002, Alabama Power Capital Trust IV, a statutory trust, issued
$100 million in Flexible Trust Preferred Securities (Five Year Initial Fixed
Rate of 4.75%) and Alabama Power Capital Trust V, a statutory trust, issued $200
million in Flexible Trust Preferred Securities (Seven Year Initial Fixed Rate of
5.50%). Both of these issuances of flexible trust preferred securities are
guaranteed by ALABAMA. The net proceeds were used to redeem $297 million in
aggregate outstanding liquidation amount of Alabama Power Capital Trust I 7.375%
Trust Preferred Securities and Alabama Power Capital Trust II 7.60% Trust
Preferred Securities and for general corporate purposes.

     Also, in October 2002, ALABAMA issued $225 million of Series Q 5.50% Senior
Notes due October 15, 2017. The proceeds from the sale will be used to redeem,
in November 2002, $217.9 million in aggregate principal amount of its Series D
6.50% Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due September 30, 2018 and for general
corporate purposes.

     Additionally, in October 2002, ALABAMA announced the planned redemptions of
(i) 500 shares of Auction Rate Preferred Stock (1988 Series) to be redeemed on
November 13, 2002 at a price of $100,000 per unit, plus accrued and unpaid
dividends to the redemption date; (ii) 200 shares of Auction Rate Preferred
Stock (1993 Series) redeemed on November 6, 2002 at a price of $100,000 per
share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date; and (iii) 1,000
shares of Capital Auction Preferred Securities of Alabama Power Capital Trust
III to be redeemed on November 29, 2002 at the redemption price of $50,000 per
preferred security, plus accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of
redemption.

     ALABAMA plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market
conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference  is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  of
ALABAMA  under  "Capital   Requirements,"   "Other  Capital   Requirements"  and
"Environmental  Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital
requirements  for its  construction  program,  maturing  debt and  environmental
compliance  efforts.

Sources  of Capital

In  addition  to the  financing  activities  previously  described  herein,
ALABAMA plans to obtain the funds required for  construction  and other purposes
from sources  similar to those used in the past. The amount,  type and timing of
any  financings  -- if  needed  -- will  depend  upon  maintenance  of  adequate
earnings,  regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors.
See Item 1 - BUSINESS -  "Financing  Programs"  in the Form 10-K for  additional
information.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at September
30, 2002 approximately $21.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, unused
committed lines of credit of approximately $964 million (including $454 million
of such lines which are dedicated to funding purchase obligations relating to
variable rate pollution control bonds) and an extendible commercial note
program. Of these lines of credit, unless extended, $31 million expire at
various times during 2002, $543 million expire in 2003 and $390 million expire
in 2004. ALABAMA may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible
commercial notes at the request and for the benefit of ALABAMA and other
SOUTHERN subsidiaries. ALABAMA has regulatory authority for up to $1.0 billion
of short-term borrowings. At September 30, 2002, ALABAMA had outstanding $39.9
million of commercial paper and $27 million in notes payable to banks.
Management believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by
utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third
quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 was $271.6 million and $569.1 million,
respectively, compared to $298.3 million and $569.1 million for the
corresponding periods in 2001. During the third quarter 2002, earnings decreased
due to higher operating expenses partially offset by increased retail sales.
Earnings year-to-date 2002 remained flat.

</TABLE>

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue increased in the third quarter 2002 by $25.4
million, or 2.6%, and decreased year-to-date 2002 by $34.4 million, or 1.4%,
when compared to the corresponding periods in 2001. The third quarter increase
reflects a 9.7% increase in residential sales due primarily to warmer weather,
partially offset by decreased rates resulting from the 2001 retail rate order.
The year-to-date decrease reflects the rate decrease and generally lower prices
to large business customers, partially offset by a 7.5% increase in residential
sales as a result of the warmer weather. Modest increases in sales to commercial
and industrial customers for both periods continue to reflect the sluggish
economy. Reference is made to Note (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information regarding the 2001 rate case.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. Sales for resale to non-affiliates
decreased in the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 primarily due to
reduced energy sales to these customers. These transactions did not have a
significant impact on earnings since the energy is usually sold at variable
cost.
     Sales for resale - affiliates. Revenues from sales for resale to affiliated
companies within the SOUTHERN system will vary depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings. Other revenues. The
third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 increases are primarily attributed to
the recognition of new late payment fees approved under the new retail rate
order effective January 1, 2002.

     Fuel expense. The increases for the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date
2002 are largely a result of the higher cost for natural gas when compared to
the same periods in 2001. These expenses do not have a significant impact on
earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through
GEORGIA's fuel cost recovery clause.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. During the third quarter 2002 and
year-to-date 2002, purchased power from non-affiliates decreased primarily as a
result of reduced demand for energy from non-affiliates. Throughout the SOUTHERN
system, an additional 2,279 megawatts of generation has been placed into
commercial operation during 2002. These expenses do not have a significant
impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues
through GEORGIA's fuel cost recovery clause.

     Purchased power - affiliates.  GEORGIA entered into new PPAs with SOUTHERN
POWER beginning in June 2002. The capacity component of these transactions
totaled $40 million in the third quarter 2002. The energy component of power
purchased from affiliated companies within the SOUTHERN system will vary
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company and will have no significant impact on earnings since energy
expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through GEORGIA's fuel cost
recovery clause.

     Other operation expense. The increases for the third quarter
2002 and year-to-date 2002 are primarily attributed to higher transmission,
fossil power generation and administrative and general expenses when compared
to the same periods in 2001.

     Depreciation and amortization. The decreases in this item for the third
quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 are mainly a result of discontinuing
accelerated depreciation and beginning amortization of the regulatory liability
for accelerated cost recovery in January 2002 in accordance with the new retail
rate order. (Reference is made to Note (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein.)

     Other, net. Other, net for the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date
2002 decreased when compared to the corresponding periods in
2001 as a result of mark to market adjustments for derivative energy contracts
and gains on property sales recorded in both of these periods in 2001. Further
contributing to these decreases in 2002 are expenses related to a new
electricity pricing program. See "Exposure to Market Risks" herein for
additional information on derivative energy contracts.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Interest expense, net. The third quarter 2002 increase is attributed
primarily to the reversal in the third quarter 2001 of interest accrued for tax
assessments related to audits that were favorably resolved. The year-to-date
2002 decrease is mainly the result of a reduction in interest rates and the
accrual of interest on accelerated amortization in 2001 under the prior retail
rate order, which ceased effective January 1, 2002.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales.

        GEORGIA has entered into PPAs with SOUTHERN POWER which will
result in higher capacity and operating and maintenance payments beginning in
June 2002. Under the new retail rate order effective January 1, 2002, these
costs will be reflected in rates evenly over the next three years.

        With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being
discussed at federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GEORGIA is
positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA
in the Form 10-K.

        In January 2002, GEORGIA began operating under a new
three-year retail rate order. Under the terms of the order, earnings will be
evaluated annually against a retail return on common equity range of 10 percent
to 12.95 percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above the 12.95 percent return
will be applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by
GEORGIA. Retail rates were decreased by $118 million effective January 1, 2002.

        On April 25, 2002, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee met and selected
the candidates that will be considered for the SeTrans ISA. On June 27, 2002,
SOUTHERN and other SeTrans sponsors submitted a Petition for Declaratory Order
seeking the FERC's approval of the SeTrans governance structure and the
selection process for the ISA, as well as guidance on various issues. The FERC
granted the petition on October 10, 2002, approving the governance structure
and the selection process for the ISA. The FERC also provided guidance on other
issues identified in the petition. On November 1, 2002, the SeTrans sponsors
announced that they had selected the team of ESB International, Ltd. ("ESBI")
and Accenture LLP as the preferred candidate for ISA. Should negotiations with
this candidate successfully conclude with final agreement among the parties,
the sponsors intend to seek any regulatory or other approvals necessary for
formation of the SeTrans RTO and the approval of ESBI/Accenture to serve in the
capacity of SeTrans ISA. Reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Certain
Factors Affecting the Industry" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In June 2002, GEORGIA entered into a fifteen-year PPA beginning in June
2005 with SOUTHERN POWER to purchase 1,040 megawatts of capacity from the
planned combined-cycle plant at Plant McIntosh to be built and owned by SOUTHERN
POWER. The annual capacity cost is expected to be approximately $72 million.
Additionally, GEORGIA has entered into a seven-year PPA beginning in June 2005
with SOUTHERN POWER to purchase capacity in an average annual amount of
approximately $48 million. The PPAs are undergoing a certification process with
the Georgia PSC. A decision is expected by December 17, 2002.

     On July 31, 2002, the FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled
"Remedying Undue Discrimination Through Open Access Transmission Service and
Standard Electricity Market Design." The FERC has indicated that the proposal,
if adopted, would (among other things): (i) require transmission assets of
jurisdictional utilities to be operated by an independent entity; (ii) establish
a standard market design; (iii) establish a single type of transmission service
that applies to all customers; (iv) assert jurisdiction over the transmission
component of bundled retail service; (v) establish a generation reserve margin;
(vi) establish bid caps for day-ahead and spot energy markets; and (vii) revise
the FERC policy on the pricing of transmission expansions. The FERC has revised
the comment schedule such that comments on certain issues are due on November
15, 2002 and comments on other issues are due on January 10, 2003. Reply
comments are due on February 17, 2003. Any impact of this proposal on SOUTHERN
and its subsidiaries will depend on the form in which final rules may be
ultimately adopted.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For additional
information, including information on the EPA litigation, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND Analysis - "Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA and
Note 3 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

     GEORGIA's business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has
increased generally throughout the United States; in particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. Although the ultimate outcome of such litigation currently filed
against GEORGIA cannot be predicted at this time, management does not anticipate
that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a
material adverse effect on GEORGIA's financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

GEORGIA's significant accounting policies are described
in Note 1 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.
GEORGIA's only critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. GEORGIA is
subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a portion of GEORGIA's
operations is no longer subject to these provisions,

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


GEORGIA would be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities
that are not specifically recoverable and determine if any other assets,
including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset Retirement Obligations,"
which  establishes new accounting and reporting  standards for legal obligations
associated with retiring assets,  including  decommissioning nuclear plants. The
liability  for an asset's  future  retirement  must be recorded in the period in
which the  liability is incurred.  The cost must be  capitalized  as part of the
related  long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life.  Changes
in the  liability  resulting  from the  passage  of time will be  recognized  as
operating  expenses.  Statement  No.  143 must be  adopted  by  January 1, 2003.
GEORGIA is currently  assessing the impact of adopting  Statement No. 143 on its
financial statements. Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of
GEORGIA under  "Depreciation and Nuclear  Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form
10-K.

     In July 2002,  the FASB issued  Statement  No. 146,  "Accounting  for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities."  Statement No. 146 requires that a
liability for costs  associated with an exit or disposal  activity be recognized
and measured  initially at fair value when the  liability is incurred.  Disposal
activities  which are  addressed  in Statement  No. 146 include the  termination
benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated,  costs
to  terminate a contract  that is not a capital  lease and costs to  consolidate
facilities  or relocate  employees.  Statement  No. 146 is effective for exit or
disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. GEORGIA does not
expect that  adoption of  Statement  No. 146 will have a material  impact on its
financial statements.

     Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item
8 of the Form 10-K regarding GEORGIA's adoption of FASB Statement No.133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.
Recent accounting changes have been issued by the Emerging Issues Task Force
("EITF") of the FASB. These changes will require certain energy trading
contracts that are currently marked to market to be accounted for under the
accrual basis. These changes will also require certain trading activities to be
recorded on a net basis for income statement presentation. The new rules will be
effective January 1, 2003. GEORGIA is in the process of determining the impact
of this recently issued guidance. However, in many cases, GEORGIA's current
transactions meet the normal purchases and sale exception under FASB Statement
No. 133 and are already accounted for under the accrual basis.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major changes in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first nine months
of 2002 were the sale of two units at Plant Wansley to SOUTHERN POWER and the
addition of approximately $620 million to utility plant. The funds for these
additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations. See GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows herein for further
details.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Credit Rating Risk

GEORGIA does not have any credit agreements that would require material changes
in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.
There are certain physical electricity sale contracts that could require
collateral -- but not termination -- in the event of a credit rating change to
below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided for by a SOUTHERN
guaranty, letter of credit or cash. At September 30, 2002, the maximum potential
collateral requirements were approximately $230 million.

Exposure to Market Risks

GEORGIA's market risk exposures  relative to interest rate changes have not
changed  materially  compared with the December 31, 2001  reporting  period.  In
addition,  GEORGIA  is not  aware  of any  facts  or  circumstances  that  would
significantly  affect such  exposures in the near term.

        Due to cost-based  rate regulations,  GEORGIA has  limited  exposure
to market  volatility  in interest rates,  commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity.  To mitigate  residual risks  relative to movements in
electricity  prices,  GEORGIA enters into fixed price  contracts for the
purchase and sale of electricity  through the wholesale electricity market and,
to a lesser extent, similar contracts for gas purchases.  The fair value of
derivative  energy  contracts  at  September  30,  2002 is as follows:

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Exposure to Market Risks" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K
and Note 1 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

Financing Activities

In June 2002,  Georgia Power Capital Trust V, a statutory  business trust,  sold
$440 million of its 7 1/8% Trust Preferred  Securities,  which are guaranteed by
GEORGIA.  The net proceeds from this issuance were used to redeem  Georgia Power
Capital Trust I and III preferred  securities totaling $414 million and to repay
a portion of GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     In July 2002, GEORGIA issued $300 million of Series J 4.875% Senior Notes
due July 15, 2007. The net proceeds from this issuance were used to prepay a
portion of a $350 million bank loan.

     In November 2002, Georgia Power Capital Trust VI, a statutory trust, sold
$300 million of its Flexible Trust Preferred Securities, which are guaranteed by
GEORGIA. The initial interest rate in effect through November 1, 2007 is 4.875%.
The net proceeds from this issuance will be used to repay a portion of GEORGIA's
short-term indebtedness and to redeem in December 2002 $175 million of 7.60%
Trust Preferred Securities issued by Georgia Power Capital Trust II.

     GEORGIA plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market
conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Issues" in the Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital
requirements for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental
compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

GEORGIA plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at September
30, 2002 approximately $45.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $1.74 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks, of which
$65 million expire in 2002 and $1.67 billion expire in 2003. Approximately $1.2
billion of the total $1.74 billion in unused credit arrangements contain
provisions allowing two-year term loans executable at expiration date. The
credit arrangements provide liquidity support to GEORGIA's obligations with
respect to variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper. GEORGIA
may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request
and for the benefit of GEORGIA and other SOUTHERN subsidiaries. At September 30,
2002, GEORGIA had outstanding $562 million of notes payable. Management believes
that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of
credit without maintaining large cash balances.

     Retail sales. Excluding the recovery of fuel expense and certain other
expenses that do not affect net income, retail sales increased by $16.4 million,
or 17.0%, for the third quarter 2002 and by $39.9 million, or 15.8%,
year-to-date 2002 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2001. Warmer
weather, growth in number of customers and the retail rate increase, which was
effective in June 2002, were the primary causes for the increases in retail
sales revenues for the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002. Reference is
made to Note (J) in the "Notes to Condensed Financial Statements" herein for
additional information. Energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial
customers were up by 7.8%, 5.9% and 7.0%, respectively, for the third quarter
2002 and 7.1%, 5.4% and 1.4%, respectively, for year-to-date 2002.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. Sales for resale to non-affiliates
decreased for the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 when compared to the
corresponding periods in 2001 mainly due to reduced demand for energy by these
customers. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since
the energy is usually sold at variable cost.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These transactions do not have
a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. Other revenues increased during the third quarter 2002 and
year-to-date 2002. Third quarter 2002 revenues increased due to higher
miscellaneous service revenues, higher franchise fees, higher revenues from the
transmission of electricity to others and revenue from the sale of gas.
Year-to-date 2002 revenues increased due to higher miscellaneous service
revenues, higher franchise fees, revenue from the sale of gas and the settlement
of a PPA.

     Fuel expense. Fuel expense increased during the third quarter 2002 and
year-to-date 2002 largely due to the commercial operation of Plant Smith Unit 3
beginning in April 2002. Since energy expenses are generally offset by energy
revenues through GULF's fuel cost recovery mechanism, these expenses do not have
a significant impact on net income.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. In the third quarter 2002 and
year-to-date 2002, purchased power from non-affiliates was lower primarily due
to lower costs for energy compared to the same periods in 2001. Throughout the
SOUTHERN system, an additional 2,279 megawatts of generation has been placed
into commercial operation during 2002. Since energy expenses are generally
offset by energy revenues through GULF's fuel clause recovery mechanism, these
expenses do not have a significant impact on net income.

     Maintenance expense. The decrease in the third quarter 2002 compared to the
corresponding period in 2001 is due to a decrease in scheduled maintenance
performed on power generating facilities. The year-to-date 2002 increase in
maintenance expense is mainly attributed to scheduled turbine and boiler
inspections and repairs for GULF's generating facilities.

     Depreciation and amortization. This item increased for the third quarter
2002 and year-to-date 2002 primarily due to an increase in plant in service,
including the addition of Plant Smith Unit 3, as compared to the same reporting
periods in the prior year.

     Taxes other than income taxes. The third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002
increases are primarily due to an increase in the state of Florida gross
receipts tax and municipal and county franchise fees, which are offset by
revenues collected from customers and do not have a significant impact on net
income.

     Other, net. The third quarter 2002 decrease in other, net is attributed to
the allowance for equity funds used during construction related to Plant Smith
Unit 3 recorded in the same period in 2001.

     Interest expense, net. The primary reason for the increase in this expense
for both reporting periods relates to additional sales of an aggregate amount of
$180 million of senior notes in the third and fourth quarters of 2001 and the
first quarter of 2002. The proceeds from these sales were used to finance Plant
Smith Unit 3, to refinance $30 million in first mortgage bonds and for general
corporate purposes.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary. The increases in the
distributions on preferred securities are due to the issuance of $30 million of
7.375% Trust Preferred Securities in November 2001.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GULF is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the Form
10-K.

     GULF's business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation
related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental
issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury
and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has increased generally
throughout the United States; in particular, personal injury claims for damages
caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent.
Although the ultimate outcome of such litigation currently filed against GULF
cannot be predicted at this time, management does not anticipate that the
liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material adverse
effect on GULF's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, including the EPA litigation, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of
GULF in the Form 10-K.

     In 1999, the Florida PSC approved GULF's plan to reduce its authorized rate
of return, reduce retail base rates and share revenues with its customers. The
revenue sharing plan expired on April 22, 2002 at the commercial in-service date
of Plant Smith Unit 3. Based upon the actual revenues for January through April
2002, there will be no refund to customers for this period. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     In April 2002, the Florida PSC approved an annual base rate increase for
GULF of $53.2 million which became effective in June 2002. Reference is made to
Note (J) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein and Item 7
- - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GULF in
the Form 10-K for additional information.

     On April 25, 2002, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee met and selected the
candidates that will be considered for the SeTrans ISA. On June 27, 2002,
SOUTHERN and other SeTrans sponsors submitted a Petition for Declaratory Order
seeking the FERC's approval of the SeTrans governance structure and the
selection of the ISA, as well as guidance on various issues. The FERC granted
the petition on October 10, 2002, approving the governance structure and the
selection process for the ISA. The FERC also provided guidance on other issues
identified in the petition. On November 1, 2002, the SeTrans sponsors announced
that they had selected the team of ESB International, Ltd. ("ESBI") and
Accenture LLP as the preferred candidate for ISA.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Should negotiations with this candidate successfully conclude
with final agreement among the parties, the sponsors intend to seek any
regulatory or other approvals necessary for formation of the SeTrans RTO and the
approval of ESBI/Accenture to serve in the capacity of SeTrans ISA. Reference is
made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Certain Factors Affecting the Industry" and Item 7

     On July 31, 2002, the FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled
"Remedying Undue Discrimination Through Open Access Transmission Service and
Standard Electricity Market Design." The FERC has indicated that the proposal,
if adopted, would (among other things): (i) require transmission assets of
jurisdictional utilities to be operated by an independent entity; (ii) establish
a standard market design; (iii) establish a single type of transmission service
that applies to all customers; (iv) assert jurisdiction over the transmission
component of bundled retail service; (v) establish a generation reserve margin;
(vi) establish bid caps for day-ahead and spot energy markets; and (vii) revise
the FERC policy on the pricing of transmission expansions. The FERC has revised
the comment schedule such that comments on certain issues are due on November
15, 2002 and comments on other issues are due on January 10, 2003. Reply
comments are due on February 17, 2003. Any impact of this proposal on SOUTHERN
and its subsidiaries will depend on the form in which final rules may be
ultimately adopted.

the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

GULF's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the financial
statements of GULF in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. GULF's only critical accounting
policy involves rate regulation. GULF is subject to the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation."
In the event that a portion of GULF's operations is no longer subject to these
provisions, GULF would be required to write off related regulatory assets and
liabilities that are not specifically recoverable and determine if any other
assets, including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset Retirement Obligations,"
which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with retiring assets. The liability for an asset's future retirement
must be recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must
be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time
will be recognized as operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by
January 1, 2003. GULF is currently assessing the impact of adopting Statement
No. 143 on its financial statements.

                               GULF POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In July 2002,  the FASB issued  Statement  No. 146,  "Accounting  for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities."  Statement No. 146 requires that a
liability for costs  associated with an exit or disposal  activity be recognized
and measured  initially at fair value when the  liability is incurred.  Disposal
activities  which are  addressed  in Statement  No. 146 include the  termination
benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated,  costs
to  terminate a contract  that is not a capital  lease and costs to  consolidate
facilities  or relocate  employees.  Statement  No. 146 is effective for exit or
disposal  activities  that are initiated  after December 31, 2002. GULF does not
expect that  adoption of  Statement  No. 146 will have a material  impact on its
financial statements.

     Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of GULF in Item 8
of the Form 10-K regarding GULF's adoption of FASB Statement No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.
Recent accounting changes have been issued by the Emerging Issues Task Force
("EITF") of the FASB. These changes will require certain energy trading
contracts that are currently marked to market to be accounted for under the
accrual basis. These changes will also require certain trading activities to be
recorded on a net basis for income statement presentation. The new rules will be
effective January 1, 2003. GULF is in the process of determining the impact of
this recently issued guidance. However, in many cases, GULF's current
transactions meet the normal purchases and sale exception under FASB Statement
No. 133 and are already accounted for under the accrual basis.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first nine months of 2002
included the addition of approximately $88.9 million to utility plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations, other long-term debt and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. See
GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows herein for further details.

Credit Rating Risk

GULF does not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in
payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

GULF's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not changed
materially compared with the December 31, 2001 reporting period. In addition,
GULF is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly affect
such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, GULF has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity.
To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, GULF
enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity
through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, similar
contracts for gas purchases. GULF has received approval from the Florida PSC to
recover prudently incurred costs related to its fuel hedging program through the
fuel cost recovery mechanism. The fair value of derivative energy contracts at
September 30, 2002 is as follows:

Financing Activities

In January 2002, GULF issued $45 million of Series E 6.00% Senior Notes due
January 30, 2012. The proceeds from the sale were used by GULF to finance
certain construction costs incurred in connection with Plant Smith Unit 3,
GULF's 574 megawatt combined-cycle facility, which was placed in service in
April 2002, and for general corporate purposes.

     In September 2002, GULF sold through public authorities $13 million of
solid waste disposal facilities revenue refunding bonds due September 1, 2028.
The proceeds, together with other moneys of GULF, were used to redeem $13
million aggregate principal amount of solid waste disposal facilities revenue
bonds, Series 1993.

     Also in September 2002, GULF sold through public authorities $42 million of
pollution control revenue bonds due September 1, 2037. The proceeds, together
with any investment proceeds and other moneys of GULF, were used to redeem $42
million aggregate principal amount of pollution control revenue bonds, First
Series 1994 and Second Series 1994.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     GULF plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital Requirements for Construction," "Other Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of GULF's capital
requirements for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental
compliance efforts.

     GULF signed an agreement with the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection in August 2002 that calls for the installation of additional
equipment at Plant Crist to proactively address ozone problems. Once the
agreement receives final approval from the Florida PSC for recovery through the
Environmental Cost Recovery Clause, the agreement will increase GULF's estimated
construction expenditures for 2003 and 2004 by $12 million and $38 million,
respectively.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any financings

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at September 30,
2002 approximately $6.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $61.9 million
of unused committed lines of credit with banks that expire in 2002 and $61.5
million that expire in 2003. The credit arrangements provide liquidity support
to GULF's obligations with respect to variable rate pollution control bonds and
commercial paper. GULF may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible
commercial notes at the request and for the benefit of GULF and other
SOUTHERN subsidiaries. At September 30, 2002, GULF had outstanding $57.9 million
of notes payable. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third
quarter 2002 and year-to date 2002 was $33.4 million and $68.1 million,
respectively, compared to $30.4 million and $56.7 million for the corresponding
periods of 2001. Earnings increased $3.0 million, or 9.9%, for the third quarter
2002 and $11.4 million, or 20.2%, year-to-date 2002 primarily due to higher
operating revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

</TABLE>

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue increased by $12.6 million, or 15.0%, in the third
quarter 2002 and by $34.9 million, or 15.9%, year-to-date 2002 when compared to
the corresponding periods in 2001 primarily due to the retail rate increase
which took effect in January 2002 and, to a lesser extent, higher retail energy
sales. (Reference is made to Note (K) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information.) Retail energy sales in the third
quarter 2002 compared to the same period in 2001 increased for residential and
commercial customers by 3.7% and 0.5%, respectively, while sales to industrial
customers decreased by 2.4%. For year-to-date 2002 as compared to the
corresponding period in 2001, total retail sales increased 4.0% and 1.8% for
residential and commercial customers, respectively, and decreased 1.4% for
industrial customers. Energy sales to industrial customers continue to be
affected by the sluggish economy.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. During the third quarter 2002 sales for
resale to non-affiliates were lower than the amounts recorded in the same period
in 2001 mainly due to decreased demand from these customers. The year-to-date
2002 increase in sales for resale to non-affiliates is primarily due to
increased demand for energy by non-affiliates and commercial operation in May
2001 of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 when compared to the corresponding periods in
2001.

                            MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These transactions do not have
a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. In the third quarter 2002, fuel expense decreased as a result
of lower unit fuel prices when compared to the same period in the prior year.
For year-to-date 2002, higher fuel expenses as compared to 2001 resulted from
increased generation. Since energy expenses are generally offset by energy
revenues through MISSISSIPPI's retail and wholesale fuel cost recovery clauses,
these expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. During the third quarter 2002 and
year-to-date 2002, purchased power from non-affiliates decreased as a result of
lower costs associated with these energy purchases and the utilization of
electricity within the SOUTHERN system when compared to the corresponding
periods in 2001. Throughout the SOUTHERN system, an additional 2,279 megawatts
of generation has been placed into commercial operation during 2002. These
purchased power transactions do not have a significant impact on net income
since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through
MISSISSIPPI's retail and wholesale fuel cost recovery clauses.

     Other operation expense. Other operation expense increased in the third
quarter 2002 primarily due to higher administrative and general expenses. The
year-to-date 2002 increase was largely related to lease payments associated with
the commercial operation of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4, which began in May 2001.

     Maintenance expense. Maintenance expense was higher during the third
quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 when compared to the same periods in the
prior year primarily due to scheduled maintenance performed at Plant Watson and
Plant Daniel in 2002.

     Taxes other than income taxes. For the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date
2002, the increases in taxes other than income taxes are primarily attributed to
additional property taxes related to the commercial operation of Plant Daniel
Units 3 and 4.

     Other, net. The reduction in other, net for the third quarter 2002 and
year-to-date 2002 is mostly related to project work requested by customers in
the corresponding periods of 2001.

     Interest expense, net. Decreases in this item for the third quarter 2002
and year-to-date 2002 when compared to the same periods in the prior year are
largely a result of lower interest rates on long-term debt and notes payable
outstanding.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales.

     In December 2001, the Mississippi PSC approved MISSISSIPPI's annual retail
rate increase of approximately $39 million, which became effective in January
2002. For additional information, see Note (K) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K regarding the
settlement agreement between MISSISSIPPI and certain wholesale customers to
increase its wholesale tariff rates effective June 1, 2002. On April 19, 2002,
the FERC accepted for filing the settlement agreement and placed the new tariff
rates in effect June 1, 2002, without modifying the agreement reached between
MISSISSIPPI and its customers. For additional information, see Note (L) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
the federal level to expand customer choice, MISSISSIPPI is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form
10-K.

     MISSISSIPPI's business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has
increased generally throughout the United States; in particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent.

     MISSISSIPPI's 2002 ECO Plan filing was approved, as filed, by the
Mississippi PSC on March 5, 2002, and resulted in a slight increase in rates.
Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot continue to be recovered. For additional information about the
Clean Air Act and other environmental issues, including the EPA litigation, see
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note
3 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     On April 25, 2002, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee met and selected the
candidates that will be considered for the SeTrans ISA. On June 27, 2002,
SOUTHERN and other SeTrans sponsors submitted a Petition for Declaratory Order
seeking the FERC's approval of the SeTrans governance structure and the
selection process for the ISA, as well as guidance on various issues. The FERC
granted the petition on October 10, 2002, approving the governance structure and
the selection process for the ISA. The FERC also provided guidance on other
issues identified in the petition. On November 1, 2002, the SeTrans sponsors
announced that they had selected the team of ESB International, Ltd. ("ESBI")
and Accenture LLP as the preferred candidate for ISA. Should negotiations with
this candidate successfully conclude with final agreement among the parties, the
sponsors intend to seek any regulatory or other approvals necessary for
formation of the SeTrans RTO and the approval of ESBI/Accenture to serve in the
capacity of SeTrans ISA. Reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Certain
Factors Affecting the Industry" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Industry Restructuring" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K for
additional information.

     On July 31, 2002, the FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled
"Remedying Undue Discrimination Through Open Access Transmission Service and
Standard Electricity Market Design." The FERC has indicated that the proposal,
if adopted, would (among other things): (i) require transmission assets of
jurisdictional utilities to be operated by an independent entity; (ii) establish
a standard market design; (iii) establish a single type of transmission service
that applies to all customers; (iv) assert jurisdiction over the transmission
component of bundled retail service; (v) establish a generation reserve margin;
(vi) establish bid caps for day-ahead and spot energy markets; and (vii) revise
the FERC policy on the pricing of transmission

expansions. The FERC has revised the comment schedule such that comments on
certain issues are due on November 15, 2002, and comments on other issues are
due on January 10, 2003. Reply comments are due on February 17, 2003. Any impact
of this proposal on SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries will depend on the form in
which final rules may be ultimately adopted.

     Reference is made to Note 6 to MISSISSIPPI's financial statements in the
Form 10-K regarding Long-Term Capacity Sales Agreements. MISSISSIPPI has entered
into a capacity sales contract under which minimum capacity revenues to
MISSISSIPPI would average approximately $21 million annually through May 2011.
The customer for that capacity, a subsidiary of Dynegy Inc. ("Dynegy"), is
currently experiencing liquidity problems and has had its credit rating reduced
below investment grade. Dynegy has provided MISSISSIPPI with a letter of credit
expiring in February 2003 totaling $26 million (approximately 15 months of
capacity payments). This letter of credit can be drawn if it is not replaced by
acceptable security prior to expiration or if there is a default under the
contract. In the event of such a default, and if MISSISSIPPI was unable to
resell that capacity in the market, future earnings could be affected. The
outcome cannot now be determined.

     Reference is made to Notes (C) through (E), (K), (L) and (Q) in the "Notes
to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.
Reference is also made to Note (E) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for information relating to certain lawsuits regarding the
installation of fiber optic cable over MISSISSIPPI's existing easements.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policies

MISSISSIPPI's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. MISSISSIPPI's
critical accounting policies involve rate regulation and lease accounting.
MISSISSIPPI is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a portion of
MISSISSIPPI's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, MISSISSIPPI
would be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that
are not specifically recoverable and determine if any other assets, including
plant, have been impaired.

    Additionally, MISSISSIPPI accounts for its lease agreement with Escatawpa
Funding, Limited Partnership ("Escatawpa") as an operating lease. Under this
agreement, Escatawpa, a special purpose entity, is owner-lessor of the
combined-cycle generating units at MISSISSIPPI's Plant Daniel. MISSISSIPPI does
not consolidate this entity since parties unrelated to MISSISSIPPI have made
substantive residual equity capital investments in excess of 3 percent. In June
2002, the FASB issued an exposure draft for comment of a proposed interpretation
on "Consolidation of Certain Special-Purpose Entities," an interpretation of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. It is expected that the exposure draft
would be finalized by year end, with an effective date for existing transactions
subject to the interpretation, including MISSISSIPPI's lease transaction, to be
implemented on April 1, 2003. This interpretation is in draft form; the final
pronouncement may differ from the draft. However, in its current draft form,
MISSISSIPPI would be deemed to be the "primary beneficiary" of its lease
arrangement with Escatawpa and would be required to consolidate the leased asset
and

related debt on its books or to restructure the existing arrangement to comply
with the final rules. Until final rules are approved by the FASB, MISSISSIPPI
will continue to analyze the impact of the exposure draft. MISSISSIPPI's current
operating lease arrangement with Escatawpa has been reviewed and approved by the
Mississippi PSC and is reflected and approved for recovery in both its retail
and wholesale rate jurisdictions. Consolidation of the leased asset and related
debt could require MISSISSIPPI to seek additional regulatory review.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset Retirement Obligations,"
which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with retiring assets. The liability for an asset's future retirement
must be recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must
be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time
will be recognized as operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by
January 1, 2003. MISSISSIPPI is currently assessing the impact of adopting
Statement No. 143 on its financial statements.

     In July 2002,  the FASB issued  Statement  No. 146,  "Accounting  for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities."  Statement No. 146 requires that a
liability for costs  associated with an exit or disposal  activity be recognized
and measured  initially at fair value when the  liability is incurred.  Disposal
activities  which are  addressed  in Statement  No. 146 include the  termination
benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated,  costs
to  terminate a contract  that is not a capital  lease and costs to  consolidate
facilities  or relocate  employees.  Statement  No. 146 is effective for exit or
disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. MISSISSIPPI does
not expect that adoption of Statement No. 146 will have a material impact on its
financial statements.

     Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in
Item 8 of the Form 10-K regarding MISSISSIPPI's adoption of FASB Statement No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.
Recent accounting changes have been issued by the Emerging Issues Task Force
("EITF") of the FASB. These changes will require certain energy trading
contracts that are currently marked to market to be accounted for under the
accrual basis. These changes will also require certain trading activities to be
recorded on a net basis for income statement presentation. The new rules will be
effective January 1, 2003. MISSISSIPPI is in the process of determining the
impact of this recently issued guidance. However, in many cases, MISSISSIPPI's
current transactions meet the normal purchases and sale exception under FASB
Statement No. 133 and are already accounted for under the accrual basis.



FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first nine months
of 2002 included the addition of approximately $48.9 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
herein for further details.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In May 2001, MISSISSIPPI began the initial 10-year term of an operating lease
agreement signed in 1999 with Escatawpa, a special purpose entity, to use a
combined-cycle generating facility located at MISSISSIPPI's Plant Daniel. The
facility cost approximately $370 million. The lease provides for a residual
value guarantee -- approximately 71 percent of the completion cost -- by
MISSISSIPPI that is due upon termination of the lease in certain circumstances.
Reference is made to Note 4 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in Item 8
of the Form 10-K and to "Critical Policies" above for additional information.

Credit Rating Risk

MISSISSIPPI does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade. There are certain fixed-price physical gas purchase contracts that
could require collateral -- but not accelerated payment -- in the event of a
credit rating change to below investment grade; however, at September 30, 2002,
this exposure was immaterial.

Exposure to Market Risks

MISSISSIPPI's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the December 31, 2001 reporting period. In
addition, MISSISSIPPI is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, MISSISSIPPI has limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, MISSISSIPPI enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale
of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent,
similar contracts for gas purchases. MISSISSIPPI has also implemented retail
fuel hedging programs at the instruction of its PSC and wholesale fuel hedging
programs under agreements with customers. The fair value of derivative, fuel and
energy contracts is as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to the retail and wholesale fuel hedging programs are recorded as
regulatory assets and liabilities. At September 30, 2002, MISSISSIPPI had
approximately $9.5 million in regulatory liabilities related to unrealized gains
on mark to market derivative contracts associated with its fuel hedging
programs. Realized gains and losses from these programs are included in fuel
expense and are recovered through MISSISSIPPI's energy cost management clauses.
Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in Item 8
of the Form 10-K and Note (L) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein regarding the respective approvals of the retail and
wholesale energy cost management clauses. Gains and losses on contracts that do
not represent hedges are recognized in the Statements of Income as incurred. For
the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2002 and 2001, these
amounts were not material.

     For additional information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Exposure to Market Risks" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form
10-K and Note 1 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in Item 8 of the Form
10-K.

Financing Activities

In March 2002, MISSISSIPPI issued $80 million of Series D Floating Rate Senior
Notes due March 12, 2004. The proceeds of the sale were used to repay $80
million of Series C Floating Rate Senior Notes due March 28, 2002. Also in March
2002, Mississippi Power Capital Trust II, a statutory business trust, sold $35
million of its 7.20% Trust Originated Preferred Securities, which are guaranteed
by MISSISSIPPI, for the purpose of redeeming in May 2002 $35 million of
Mississippi Power Capital Trust I 7.75% Trust Originated Preferred Securities.

     In October 2002, MISSISSIPPI sold through public authorities an aggregate
principal amount of $42.625 million of Mississippi Business Finance Corporation
Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2002 due September 1, 2028.
The proceeds of this sale will be used to redeem (i) $16.75 million aggregate
principal amount of Harrison County, Mississippi Pollution Control Revenue
Refunding Bonds, Series 1992; (ii) $18 million aggregate principal amount of
Jackson County, Mississippi Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series
1993; and (iii) $7.875 million aggregate principal amount of Mississippi
Business Finance Corporation Water Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds,
Series 1993.

     MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" and Note 3 to the financial statements
in the Form 10-K for a description of MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its
construction program, environmental compliance efforts and maturities of
long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at
September 30, 2002, approximately $45.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and
$60 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks that expire in
2002 and $77.5 million that expire in 2003. The credit arrangements provide
liquidity support to MISSISSIPPI's obligations with respect to variable rate
pollution control bonds and commercial paper. MISSISSIPPI may also meet
short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to issue and sell
commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for the
benefit of MISSISSIPPI and other SOUTHERN subsidiaries. At September 30, 2002,
MISSISSIPPI had no outstanding notes payable. Management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income for the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 was $13.1
million and $22.0 million, respectively, as compared to $11.3 million and $19.0
million for the corresponding periods of 2001. Earnings increased by $1.8
million, or 16.3%, in the third quarter 2002 and increased by $3.0 million, or
15.5%, year-to-date 2002. The increases in earnings for both periods in 2002
were primarily due to higher operating revenues and lower depreciation and
amortization expenses, offset somewhat by higher operation and maintenance
expenses, and higher purchased power capacity expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

</TABLE>

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which do not affect net income,
retail sales revenue increased by $6.3 million, or 12.3%, for the third quarter
2002 and by $11.2 million, or 8.9%, for year-to-date 2002 when compared to the
same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of increased demand due to
hotter weather, growth in the number of customers served and the impact of the
base rate increase. Energy sales in the third quarter 2002 increased by 7.8%,
7.5% and 9.3% to residential, commercial and industrial customers, respectively,
when compared to the corresponding periods in 2001. Year-to-date energy sales
increased to residential and commercial customers by 4.1% and 6.9%,
respectively, while industrial energy sales were down slightly by 0.6%.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. Sales for resale to non-affiliates
during the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 decreased when compared to
the same periods in 2001 primarily due to lower demand for energy by
non-affiliates. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings
since the energy is usually sold at variable cost.

                       SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - affiliates. Revenues from sales for resale to affiliated
companies within the SOUTHERN system will vary depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. Decreases in purchased power from
non-affiliates for the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 are directly
related to the 7 1/2 year PPA between SAVANNAH and SOUTHERN POWER for energy and
capacity from Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 which began operation in June 2002.
The energy which was previously purchased from non-affiliated companies is now
being purchased from affiliates. Throughout the SOUTHERN system, an additional
2,279 megawatts of generation has been placed into commercial operation during
2002. Non-affiliated transactions are primarily energy and do not have a
significant impact on earnings, as energy costs are generally recovered through
SAVANNAH's fuel cost recovery clause.

     Purchased power - affiliates. As noted above, the increase in purchased
power from affiliates was due to the new PPA with SOUTHERN POWER which became
effective June 2002. The annual capacity costs of this PPA are approximately
$14.0 million. The capacity costs of the PPA will be recovered through base
rates and the energy component is recovered through the fuel cost recovery
clause. (Reference is made to Note (M) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein.) Purchased power-affiliates also includes energy purchases
which will vary depending on demand and cost of generation resources at each
company. These energy costs are recovered through the fuel cost recovery clause
and have no significant impact on earnings.

     Other operation expense. During the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date
2002, other operation expense increased when compared to the corresponding
periods in 2001. The third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 increases are
primarily attributed to higher distribution expenses and higher administrative
and general expenses.

     Maintenance expense. The third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 increases
when compared to the corresponding periods in 2001 are primarily a result of
scheduled maintenance outages at Plant Kraft and amortization of expenses for a
major maintenance project on the combustion turbines at Plant McIntosh.

     Depreciation and amortization. This item decreased in the third quarter
2002 and year-to-date 2002 primarily as a result of discontinuing accelerated
depreciation and beginning to amortize the regulatory liability for accelerated
depreciation back to the customers in June 2002, in accordance with the new
retail rate order. (Reference is made to Note (M) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein.)

     Interest expense, net. A reduction in outstanding debt and lower interest
rates are the reasons for the decreases in interest expense, net in the third
quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 when compared to the same periods in 2001.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effects of weather and the economy
on energy sales. For information regarding the results of a recent rate filing,
reference is made to Note (M) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information.

                       SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SAVANNAH is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form
10-K.

     SAVANNAH's business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has
increased generally throughout the United States; in particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. Although the ultimate outcome of such litigation currently filed
against SAVANNAH cannot be predicted at this time, management does not
anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would
have a material adverse effect on SAVANNAH's financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For additional
information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental issues, including
the EPA litigation, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of SAVANNAH in
the Form 10-K.

     On April 25, 2002, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee met and selected the
candidates that will be considered for the SeTrans ISA. On June 27, 2002,
SOUTHERN and other SeTrans sponsors submitted a Petition for Declaratory Order
seeking the FERC's approval of the SeTrans governance structure and the
selection process for the ISA, as well as guidance on various issues. The FERC
granted the petition on October 10, 2002, approving the governance structure and
the selection process for the ISA. The FERC also provided guidance on other
issues identified in the petition. On November 1, 2002, the SeTrans sponsors
announced that they had selected the team of ESB International, Ltd. ("ESBI")
and Accenture LLP as the preferred candidate for ISA. Should negotiations with
this candidate successfully conclude with final agreement among the parties, the
sponsors intend to seek any regulatory or other approvals necessary for
formation of the SeTrans RTO and the approval of ESBI/Accenture to serve in the
capacity of SeTrans ISA. Reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Certain
Factors Affecting the Industry" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Industry Restructuring" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     SAVANNAH plans to retire a 102 megawatt peaking facility in May 2005. In
June 2002, SAVANNAH entered into a fifteen-year PPA with SOUTHERN POWER to
purchase 200 megawatts of capacity beginning in June 2005 from the planned
combined-cycle plant at Plant McIntosh to be built and owned by SOUTHERN POWER.
The annual capacity cost is expected to be approximately $14.5 million. The PPA
is undergoing a certification process with the Georgia PSC. A decision is
expected by December 17, 2002.

     On July 31, 2002, the FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled
"Remedying Undue Discrimination Through Open Access Transmission Service and
Standard Electricity Market Design." The FERC has indicated that the proposal,
if adopted, would (among other things): (i) require transmission assets of
jurisdictional utilities to be operated by an independent entity; (ii) establish
a standard market design; (iii) establish a single type of transmission service
that applies to all customers; (iv) assert jurisdiction over the transmission
component of bundled retail service; (v) establish a generation reserve margin;
(vi) establish bid caps for day-ahead and spot energy markets; and (vii) revise
the FERC policy on the pricing of transmission expansions. The FERC has revised
the comment schedule such that comments on certain issues are due on November
15, 2002 and comments on other issues are due on January 10, 2003. Reply

comments are due on February 17, 2003. Any impact of this proposal on SOUTHERN
and its subsidiaries will depend on the form in which final rules may be
ultimately adopted.

     Reference is made to Notes (C) through (E), (M) and (Q) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.
Reference is also made to Note (E) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for information relating to certain lawsuits regarding the
installation of fiber optic cable over SAVANNAH's existing easements.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

SAVANNAH's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. SAVANNAH's only
critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. SAVANNAH is subject to the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation." In the event that a portion of SAVANNAH's operations is no
longer subject to these provisions, SAVANNAH would be required to write off
related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
and determine if any other assets, including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset Retirement Obligations,"
which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with retiring assets. The liability for an asset's future retirement
must be recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must
be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time
will be recognized as operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by
January 1, 2003. SAVANNAH is currently assessing the impact of adopting
Statement No. 143 on its financial statements.

     In July 2002,  the FASB issued  Statement  No. 146,  "Accounting  for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities."  Statement No. 146 requires that a
liability for costs  associated with an exit or disposal  activity be recognized
and measured  initially at fair value when the  liability is incurred.  Disposal
activities  which are  addressed  in Statement  No. 146 include the  termination
benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated,  costs
to  terminate a contract  that is not a capital  lease and costs to  consolidate
facilities  or relocate  employees.  Statement  No. 146 is effective for exit or
disposal  activities that are initiated  after December 31, 2002.  SAVANNAH does
not expect that adoption of Statement No. 146 will have a material impact on its
financial statements.

     Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of SAVANNAH in Item
8 of the Form 10-K regarding SAVANNAH's adoption of FASB Statement No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.
Recent accounting changes have been issued by the Emerging Issues Task Force
("EITF") of the FASB. These changes will require certain energy trading
contracts that are currently marked to market to be accounted for under the
accrual basis. These changes will also require certain trading activities to be
recorded on a net basis for income statement presentation. The new rules will be
effective January 1, 2003. SAVANNAH is in the process of determining the impact
of this recently issued guidance.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


However, in many cases, SAVANNAH's current transactions meet the normal
purchases and sale exception under FASB Statement No. 133 and are already
accounted for under the accrual basis.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first nine months of
2002 included the addition of approximately $26.3 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations and the issuance of securities. See SAVANNAH's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows herein for further details.

Credit Rating Risk

SAVANNAH does not have any credit agreements that would require material changes
in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

SAVANNAH's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the December 31, 2001 reporting period. In
addition, SAVANNAH is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, SAVANNAH has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity.
To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, SAVANNAH
enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity
through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, similar
contracts for gas purchases. SAVANNAH has also implemented a retail fuel hedging
program at the instruction of its PSC. The fair value of derivative energy
contracts at September 30, 2002 is as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to the retail fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets
and liabilities. At September 30, 2002, SAVANNAH had approximately $578 thousand
in regulatory liabilities related to unrealized gains on mark to market
derivative contracts associated with its fuel hedging programs. Realized gains
and losses from these programs are included in fuel expense and are recovered
through SAVANNAH's fuel cost recovery clause. Gains and losses on contracts that
do not represent hedges are recognized in the Statements of Income as incurred.
For the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2002 and 2001,
these amounts were not material.

     For additional information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Exposure to Market Risks" of SAVANNAH in the Form
10-K and Note 1 to the financial statements of SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form
10-K.

Financing Activities

In September 2002, SAVANNAH entered into a three-year revolving credit agreement
in the amount of $30 million. SAVANNAH immediately borrowed $25 million against
this line, which will remain outstanding until the termination of the line on
September 6, 2005. This long-term borrowing is priced at 6 months LIBOR + 37.5
basis points. The proceeds of the borrowing were used to pay off short-term
indebtedness.

     On November 7, 2002, SAVANNAH issued $55 million of Series D 5.50% Senior
Insured Quarterly Notes due November 15, 2017. The proceeds will be used to
redeem in December 2002 $23.1 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of
its First Mortgage Bonds, 7.40% Series due July 1, 2023 and $30 million
outstanding aggregate principal amount of its Series A 6 5/8% Senior Retail
Intermediate Bonds due March 17, 2015 and for general corporate purposes.

     SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of SAVANNAH
under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Other Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of SAVANNAH's capital
requirements for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental
compliance efforts.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at September
30, 2002 approximately $4.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $65 million
of committed credit arrangements with banks, of which $10 million expired on
October 28, 2002, $40 million expires in 2003 and $15 million expires in 2005.
The credit arrangements provide liquidity support to SAVANNAH's obligations with
respect to variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper. SAVANNAH
may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request
and for the benefit of SAVANNAH and other SOUTHERN subsidiaries. At September
30, 2002, SAVANNAH had outstanding $5.7 million of notes payable. Since SAVANNAH
has no major generating plants under construction, management believes that the
need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

SOUTHERN POWER was formed in January 2001 as a wholly owned subsidiary of
SOUTHERN. SOUTHERN POWER owns, constructs and acquires SOUTHERN's new
competitive contract-based wholesale generation assets. SOUTHERN POWER is the
primary vehicle to develop SOUTHERN's position in the competitive contract-based
wholesale generation market. SOUTHERN POWER began significant operations when
Plant Dahlberg was transferred from GEORGIA in July 2001.

Earnings

In 2001 and through May 2002, Plant Dahlberg was SOUTHERN POWER's only electric
generating facility in commercial operation. Plant Franklin Unit 1 and Plant
Wansley Units 6 and 7 were placed in commercial operation in June 2002 and
SOUTHERN POWER's PPAs with GEORGIA and SAVANNAH for those units went into
effect. Also in June 2002, SOUTHERN POWER's PPAs with 11 electric municipal
cooperatives in Georgia went into effect. Reference is made to "OUR BUSINESS --
Existing and Approved Power Purchase Agreements" and "OUR BUSINESS -- 2002 Power
Purchase Agreements and Requirements Agreements" in the Southern Power
Prospectus.

     SOUTHERN POWER's net income for third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002
was $27.3 million and $40.6 million, respectively, compared to $6.0 million and
$4.9 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2001. The increase
in earnings for both reporting periods is primarily attributed to the sale of
wholesale capacity and energy to affiliated and non-affiliated companies. A
significant portion of this income is a result of the commercial operation of
Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 and Plant Franklin Unit 1 on June 1, 2002 and the
initiation of PPAs for those units with GEORGIA and SAVANNAH. In addition, 2002
reflects a full nine months of Plant Dahlberg's operations and related PPAs with
non-affiliates.

     Operating Revenues. In the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002,
operating revenues increased by $121.6 million and $198.7 million, respectively,
when compared to the corresponding periods in 2001 primarily due to the
commercial operation in June 2002 of Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 and Plant
Franklin Unit 1. Revenues for both of these reporting periods were mainly
derived from PPAs with affiliated companies and, to a lesser extent,
non-affiliated companies. Revenues from sales to affiliated companies through
the SOUTHERN system power pool ("Southern Pool") that are not covered by PPAs
and energy sales under PPAs will vary depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Pool. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since the energy is
generally sold at variable cost.

     Fuel expense. The third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 increases in
fuel expense are primarily attributed to commercial operation in June 2002 of
Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 and Plant Franklin Unit 1, when compared to the
corresponding periods in 2001.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power from non-affiliates. During the third quarter 2002 and
year-to-date 2002, these purchases from non-affiliates increased in order to
meet the demand for much larger contractual sales commitments and the
fulfillment of those contracts using purchased energy in some cases.

     Purchased power from affiliates. These expenses in the third quarter 2002
and year-to-date 2002 increased as a result of much larger contractual sales
commitments and the fulfillment of those contracts using purchased energy in
some cases. Expenses from purchased power transactions will vary depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources accessible
throughout the SOUTHERN system.

     Other operation expense. For the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002,
other operation expense increased when compared to the same periods in 2001. The
increases are related to production expenses and administrative and general
expenses resulting from the commercial operation in June 2002 of Plant Wansley
Units 6 and 7 and Plant Franklin Unit 1. In addition, administrative and general
expenses include the write-off in May 2002 of $2.9 million for previously
deferred site investigation and site development costs associated with potential
new plant sites that, after management review, are no longer considered probable
for future development.

     Maintenance expense. The increases for the third quarter 2002 and
year-to-date 2002 are directly related to commercial operation of Plant Dahlberg
in May 2001 and Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 and Plant Franklin Unit 1 in June
2002.

     Depreciation and amortization. The third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002
increases are primarily due to the increase of utility plant placed in service
in June 2002.

     Taxes other than income taxes. In 2002, this item is related to property
taxes for Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 and Plant Franklin Unit 1.

     Other, net. The decreases for the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002
are mainly attributed to unrealized losses on derivative energy contracts. See
"Exposure to Market Risks" below for further information related to these
contracts.

     Interest expense, net. Increases for the third quarter 2002 and
year-to-date 2002 are primarily due to the increased amount of outstanding debt
when compared to the corresponding periods in 2001. Debt increased due to the
issuance of $575 million in senior notes in June 2002 and increased borrowings
from SOUTHERN to support the ongoing construction program.

Effects of Inflation

SOUTHERN POWER is subject to long-term contracts and income tax laws that are
based on the recovery of historical costs. While the inflation rate has been
relatively low in recent years, it still has an adverse effect on SOUTHERN POWER
because of its large investments in generating facilities with long economic
lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize this
economic loss nor the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing
facilities with fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations for the third quarter 2002 and year-to-date 2002 are
not necessarily indicative of future earnings. The level of future earnings
depends on numerous factors including regulatory matters, energy sales,
creditworthiness of customers, completion of construction on new generating
facilities and the total generating capacity available in the Super Southeast.

     SOUTHERN POWER's PPAs with non-affiliated counterparties have provisions
that require the posting of collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee in
the event that S&P or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of such counterparty
to below-investment grade, or, if the counterparty is not rated, fails to
maintain a minimum coverage ratio. The PPAs are expected to provide SOUTHERN
POWER with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms. For
additional information on PPAs, reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS under "Future Earnings Potential" in the
Southern Power Prospectus.

     In 2002, SOUTHERN POWER executed additional long-term power sales
agreements whereby SOUTHERN POWER will sell capacity and energy from planned
generating facilities. These contracts begin in 2005 and are subject to
regulatory approval. Under these contracts, SOUTHERN POWER has the right, at its
sole discretion, to supply capacity and energy under these arrangements from any
resource available to them as part of the SOUTHERN system. Reference is made to
Note (C) to SOUTHERN POWER's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the
six-month periods ended June 30, 2002 and 2001 in the Southern Power Prospectus.

     SOUTHERN POWER has capacity sale contracts with subsidiaries of Dynegy Inc.
("Dynegy"). Dynegy is currently experiencing liquidity problems and has had its
credit rating reduced below investment grade. Minimum capacity revenues under
one of these contracts average approximately $13 million annually through May
2005. Dynegy has provided a letter of credit expiring in February 2003 totaling
$20 million (approximately 18 months of capacity payments) to SOUTHERN POWER. In
addition, two one-year letters of credit totaling $50 million (approximately 14
months of capacity payments) were provided in April 2002 as security for
obligations of affiliates of Dynegy under the Plant Franklin Unit 3 PPA
beginning in 2005. These letters of credit can be drawn in the event of (a) a
default under the PPA or (b) failure to renew the letters of credit prior to
expiration. In the event of such a default, and if SOUTHERN POWER was unable to
resell that capacity in the market, future earnings could be affected. The
outcome cannot now be determined.

                             SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Federal and state environmental regulatory agencies are actively
considering and developing additional control strategies for emission of air
pollution from all major sources of air pollution, particularly electric
generating facilities. This includes the overall reduction of emission of
nitrogen oxides ("NOx") in the eastern United States, the reduction of NOx and
particulate matter emissions to reduce regional haze and visibility impairment
in sensitive areas, the development of appropriate control standards and
technologies for emissions of mercury and the reduction of so-called "greenhouse
gases" (such as carbon dioxide) to address concerns over global climate change.
For additional information, reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS under "Future Earnings Potential -
Environmental Matters" in the Southern Power Prospectus.

     SOUTHERN POWER's business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has
increased generally throughout the United States; in particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent.

     On April 25, 2002, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee met and selected the
candidates that will be considered for the SeTrans ISA. On June 27, 2002,
SOUTHERN and other SeTrans sponsors submitted a Petition for Declaratory Order
seeking the FERC's approval of the SeTrans governance structure and the
selection process for the ISA, as well as guidance on various issues. The FERC
granted the petition on October 10, 2002, approving the governance structure and
the selection process for the ISA. The FERC also provided guidance on the other
issues identified in the petition. On November 1, 2002, the SeTrans sponsors
announced that they had selected the team of ESB International, Ltd. ("ESBI")
and Accenture LLP as the preferred candidate for ISA. Should negotiations with
this candidate successfully conclude with final agreement among the parties, the
sponsors intend to seek any regulatory or other approvals necessary for
formation of the SeTrans RTO and the approval of ESBI/Accenture to serve in the
capacity of SeTrans ISA. Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS under "FERC Matters" in the Southern Power
Prospectus for additional information.

     On July 31, 2002, the FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled
"Remedying Undue Discrimination Through Open Access Transmission Service and
Standard Electricity Market Design." The FERC has indicated that the proposal,
if adopted, would (among other things): (i) require transmission assets of
jurisdictional utilities to be operated by an independent entity; (ii) establish
a standard market design; (iii) establish a single type of transmission service
that applies to all customers; (iv) assert jurisdiction over the transmission
component of bundled retail service; (v) establish a generation reserve margin;
(vi) establish bid caps for day-ahead and spot energy markets; and (vii) revise
the FERC policy on the pricing of transmission expansions. The FERC has revised
the comment schedule such that comments on certain issues are due on November
15, 2002 and comments on other issues are due on January 10, 2003. Reply
comments are due on February 17, 2003. Any impact of this proposal on SOUTHERN
and its subsidiaries will depend on the form in which final rules may be
ultimately adopted.

     Reference is made to Note 10 - "Contingencies" to the consolidated
financial statements for December 31, 2001 contained in the Southern Power
Prospectus for discussion of various contingencies and other matters which may
affect future earnings potential. Reference is also made to Notes (E), (N), (P)

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Accounting Policies

Critical Policies

SOUTHERN POWER's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 -
"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
consolidated financial statements for December 31, 2001 contained in the
Southern Power Prospectus. SOUTHERN POWER has three critical accounting policies
that require a significant amount of judgment and are considered to be the most
important to the presentation of SOUTHERN POWER's financial position and results
of operations. The first critical policy is the levelized recognition of
capacity revenues from long-term contracts. Secondly, SOUTHERN POWER designates
qualifying derivative instruments as cash flow or fair value hedges under FASB
Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities" and marks such derivative instruments to market based primarily on
quoted market prices. The unrealized changes in fair value of qualifying cash
flow hedges are deferred in Other Comprehensive Income. Any ineffectiveness in
those hedges and changes in non-qualifying positions are reported as a component
of current period income. Third, SOUTHERN POWER uses flow-through accounting for
state manufacturer's tax credits. This means that SOUTHERN POWER recognizes the
credit as a reduction of tax expense when it is more likely than not to be
allowed by the Georgia Department of Revenue.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset Retirement Obligations,"
which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with retiring assets. The liability for an asset's future retirement
must be recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must
be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time
will be recognized as operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by
January 1, 2003. SOUTHERN POWER is currently assessing the impact of adopting
Statement No. 143 on its financial statements.

     In July 2002,  the FASB issued  Statement  No. 146,  "Accounting  for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities."  Statement No. 146 requires that a
liability for costs  associated with an exit or disposal  activity be recognized
and measured  initially at fair value when the  liability is incurred.  Disposal
activities  which are  addressed  in Statement  No. 146 include the  termination
benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated,  costs
to  terminate a contract  that is not a capital  lease and costs to  consolidate
facilities  or relocate  employees.  Statement  No. 146 is effective for exit or
disposal  activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002.  SOUTHERN POWER
does not expect that adoption of Statement  No. 146 will have a material  impact
on its financial statements.

     Reference is made to Note 1 - "Basis of Presentation and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements for
December 31, 2001 contained in the Southern Power Prospectus regarding SOUTHERN
POWER's application of FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. Recent accounting changes have
been issued by the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the FASB. These
changes will require certain energy trading contracts that are currently marked
to market to be accounted for under the accrual basis. These changes will also
require certain trading activities to be recorded on a net basis for income
statement presentation. The new rules will be effective January 1, 2003.
SOUTHERN POWER is in the process of determining the impact of this recently

issued guidance. However, in many cases, SOUTHERN POWER's current transactions
meet the normal purchases and sale exception under FASB Statement No. 133 and
are already accounted for under the accrual basis.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major changes in SOUTHERN POWER's financial condition during the first nine
months of 2002 were the addition of approximately $1.1 billion to utility plant
related to on-going construction of SOUTHERN POWER's combined-cycle units and
the transfer of two units at Plant Wansley from GEORGIA. The funds for these
additions were provided by SOUTHERN POWER's credit facility, the issuance of
Senior Notes in June 2002 and capital contributions and subordinated loans from
SOUTHERN. See SOUTHERN POWER's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows herein for
further details.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In 2001, SOUTHERN POWER entered into a financial arrangement with Westdeutsche
Landesbank Girozentrale ("WestLB") whereby SOUTHERN POWER could assign up to
$125 million in vendor contracts for equipment to WestLB. For accounting
purposes, WestLB was the owner of the contracts. SOUTHERN POWER acted as an
agent for WestLB and instructed WestLB when to make payments to the vendors.
SOUTHERN POWER terminated this arrangement and reacquired these assets in March
2002 for their original cost of $61 million. SOUTHERN POWER will indemnify
WestLB against any future claims arising from the arrangement and SOUTHERN has
guaranteed SOUTHERN POWER's indemnification obligation.

     In conjunction with the termination of the agreement, WestLB assigned a
contract with Alstom Power Inc. ("Alstom") related to the purchase and sale of a
steam generator and auxiliary equipment for Plant Franklin Unit 3 to SOUTHERN
POWER. SOUTHERN entered into a limited keep-well arrangement with Alstom whereby
SOUTHERN will contribute funds to SOUTHERN POWER via loans or capital
contributions to fund SOUTHERN POWER's performance or equipment purchases under
certain arrangements. As of September 30, 2002, SOUTHERN POWER's remaining
purchase obligations to Alstom totaled approximately $2.0 million.

Credit Rating Risk

SOUTHERN POWER does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade. There are certain physical electricity sale contracts, fixed-price
physical gas purchases and agreements covering interest rate swaps and currency
swaps that could require collateral -- but not accelerated payment -- in the
event of a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral
may be provided for by a SOUTHERN guaranty, letter of credit or cash. At
September 30, 2002, the maximum potential collateral requirements under the
electricity sale contracts and financial instrument agreements were
approximately $192 million. At September 30, 2002, there were no material
collateral requirements for the gas purchase contracts.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Exposure to Market Risks

SOUTHERN POWER is exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates,
currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, SOUTHERN POWER nets the exposure to take
advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions
for the remaining exposure pursuant to policies in areas such as counterparty
exposure and hedging practices. SOUTHERN POWER's policy is that derivatives
are to be used primarily for hedging purposes. Derivative positions are
monitored using techniques that include market valuation and sensitivity
analysis.

     If SOUTHERN POWER sustained a 100 basis-point change in interest rates for
all variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized gross
interest cost by approximately $3.3 million at September 30, 2002. Most or all
of that change would be capitalized, given the size of SOUTHERN POWER's
construction program. To further mitigate SOUTHERN POWER's exposure to interest
rates, it has entered into interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow
hedges of 2002 and 2003 planned debt issuances. Changes in the fair values of
these swaps are deferred in Other Comprehensive Income. Based on SOUTHERN
POWER's overall interest rate exposure at September 30, 2002, including
derivative and other interest-rate sensitive instruments, a near-term 100
basis-point change in interest rates would not materially affect SOUTHERN
POWER's financial statements. In addition, SOUTHERN POWER is not aware of any
facts or circumstances that would significantly affect such exposures in the
near term.

     Because energy from SOUTHERN POWER's facilities is primarily sold under
long-term contracts with tolling agreements and provisions shifting
substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the PPA counterparties,
SOUTHERN POWER's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and
prices of electricity is limited. To mitigate residual risks in those areas,
SOUTHERN POWER enters into fixed-price contracts for the purchase or sale of
fuel and electricity. In connection with the transfers of Plant Franklin in 2001
and Plant Wansley in 2002 to SOUTHERN POWER, GEORGIA transferred approximately
$5.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, in derivative assets relating to
electric and gas forward contracts in effect at the date of the transfers. These
contracts were recorded at fair value on the date of the transfer, which was
equal to GEORGIA's carrying amount. Following the transfer, these contracts are
marked to market through income until realized and settled.

     SOUTHERN POWER has firm purchase commitments that require payment in Euros.
As a hedge against fluctuations in the exchange rate for Euros, SOUTHERN POWER
entered into forward contracts to purchase Euros and has designated these
contracts as fair value hedges of an unrecognized firm commitment. Since the
terms of these Euro contracts mirror the purchase commitment terms, there is no
ineffectiveness recognized in income. At September 30, 2002, SOUTHERN POWER had
outstanding contracts covering a notional amount of $11.9 million in commitments
through May 2003.

     Unrealized gains and losses on electric and gas contracts used to hedge
anticipated purchases and sales are deferred in Other Comprehensive Income.
Gains and losses on contracts that do not represent hedges are recognized in the
Statements of Income as incurred. The fair values of derivative energy contracts
at September 30, 2002 are as follows:

     Realized gains and losses on hedged transactions are recognized in revenues
and/or fuel expense in the Statements of Income as incurred. For the three month
and nine month periods ended September 30, 2002, approximately $2.3 million and
$4.9 million, respectively, of losses were recognized in Other Income in the
Statements of Income. For the three month and nine month periods ended September
30, 2001, these amounts were not material.

Financing Activities

During the first nine months of 2002, SOUTHERN made to SOUTHERN POWER equity
contributions of approximately $275.9 million, plus subordinated loans of
approximately $212.9 million. Equity contributions and subordinated loans from
SOUTHERN are projected to total approximately $980 million to SOUTHERN POWER by
the end of 2002. No dividends are projected to be paid in 2002.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In June 2002, SOUTHERN POWER issued $575 million of 6.25% Senior Notes,
Series A due July 15, 2012. The net proceeds were used to reduce outstanding
indebtedness under a revolving credit agreement and to reduce loans from
SOUTHERN. SOUTHERN POWER also settled several interest rate swap agreements
entered into in anticipation of this issuance at a $16.9 million loss. This
amount has been deferred in Other Comprehensive Income and will be amortized to
Interest Expense over the life of the Senior Notes. Reference is made to Note
(N) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional
information relating to interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS under "Capital Requirements for Construction" and "Other Capital
Requirements" in the Southern Power Prospectus for a description of SOUTHERN
POWER's capital requirements for its construction program, maturing debt,
purchase commitments and long-term service agreements.

Sources of Capital

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SOUTHERN POWER had at September
30, 2002 approximately $48 thousand of cash and cash equivalents. To meet
liquidity and capital resource requirements, SOUTHERN POWER had at September 30,
2002 approximately $574 million of unused committed credit arrangements with
banks expiring in 2004. Amounts drawn under the arrangements are used to finance
acquisition and construction costs related to gas-fired electric generating
facilities and for general corporate purposes, subject to borrowing limitations
for each generating facility. The arrangements permit SOUTHERN POWER to fund
construction of future generating facilities upon meeting certain requirements.
At September 30, 2002, SOUTHERN POWER had $276 million in outstanding bank
borrowings.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)      The condensed financial statements of the registrants included herein
         have been prepared by each registrant, without audit,
         pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.  In the opinion of
         each registrant's management, the information regarding
         such registrant furnished herein reflects all adjustments necessary to
         present fairly the results of operations for the periods ended
         September 30, 2002 and 2001.  Certain information and footnote
         disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
         accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
         United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules
         and regulations, although each registrant believes that the
         disclosures regarding such registrant are adequate to make the
         information presented not misleading.  Disclosure which would
         substantially duplicate the disclosure in the Form 10-K and, in the
         case of SOUTHERN POWER, in the Southern Power Prospectus and details
         which have not changed significantly in amount or composition since
         the filing of the Form 10-K and the Southern Power Prospectus are
         omitted from this Form 10-Q.  Therefore, it is suggested that these
         condensed financial statements of SOUTHERN and the operating
         companies be read in conjunction with the financial statements of
         such registrant and the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K and,
         for SOUTHERN POWER, the Southern Power Prospectus.  Certain prior
         period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period
         presentation.  Due to seasonal variations in the demand for energy,
         operating results for the periods presented do not necessarily
         indicate operating results for the entire year.

(B)      Reference is made to Note 11 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in
         Item 8 and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Overview of
         Consolidated Earnings and Dividends" of SOUTHERN in Item 7 of the Form
         10-K for information on the spin off of Mirant from SOUTHERN.

         On April 2, 2001, SOUTHERN completed the spin off of Mirant with a tax
         free distribution to SOUTHERN's shareholders of its remaining ownership
         of 272 million Mirant shares. Shares from the spin off were distributed
         at a ratio of approximately 0.4 share of Mirant common stock for every
         share of SOUTHERN common stock held at the record date. The
         distribution resulted in charges of approximately $3.2 billion and $0.4
         billion to SOUTHERN's paid-in capital and retained earnings,
         respectively. The distribution was treated as a non-cash transaction
         for purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows.

         As a result of the spin off, SOUTHERN's financial statements reflect
         Mirant as discontinued operations. All historical financial statements
         presented and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to this
         presentation.

         In August 2002, Mirant announced that it was reviewing several
         accounting issues relating to its 2001 financial statements. On
         November 7, 2002, Mirant filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June
         30, 2002 and announced that it had identified accounting errors in
         previously issued financial statements, primarily related to its risk
         management and marketing operations. As a result of these accounting
         errors, Mirant reported that its net income for January 1, 1999 through
         December 31, 2001 was overstated by $51 million. Mirant identified a
         number of items that contributed to this overstatement

                                      106
<PAGE>


NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         and stated that the specific periods to which certain of these items
         apply have not been determined. Mirant also identified certain balance
         sheet adjustments for 2000 and 2001. Because SOUTHERN reported Mirant
         as discontinued operations, those balance sheet adjustments do not
         affect SOUTHERN's financial statements. Mirant further announced that
         it had requested its independent auditors to reaudit Mirant's 2000 and
         2001 financial statements to address the accounting errors identified
         during its review and to comply with certain new accounting standards.
         Mirant stated that it did not believe that its reaudit could be
         completed until it files its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
         2002 (due by March 31, 2003). If Mirant's reaudit of its 2000 and 2001
         financial statements results in adjustments that relate to periods
         prior to SOUTHERN's spin off of Mirant, SOUTHERN's earnings from
         discontinued operations and net assets of discontinued operations for
         such periods could be affected. Because any such adjustments would only
         relate to operations discontinued by SOUTHERN, they would have no
         effect on SOUTHERN's 2002 earnings or its future earnings potential,
         financial position, liquidity or cash flows. Based on the nature and
         amount of Mirant's identified accounting errors, SOUTHERN's management
         does not currently anticipate that a reaudit of SOUTHERN's 2000 and
         2001 financial statements will be necessary.

(C)      The operating companies are subject to the provisions of FASB Statement
         No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In
         the event that a portion of a company's operations is no longer subject
         to these provisions, the company would be required to write off related
         regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
         and determine if any other assets have been impaired. For additional
         information, see Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
         each of the operating companies in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)      Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN,
         ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form
         10-K for information on EPA litigation. On November 4, 2002, the U.S.
         District Court in Alabama extended the stay of the EPA litigation
         proceeding in Alabama until the earlier of February 4, 2003 or a ruling
         by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the related
         litigation involving TVA.

(E)      Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
         the operating companies in Item 8 and to "Legal Proceedings" in Item 3
         of the Form 10-K for information relating to various lawsuits. For
         information on SOUTHERN POWER contingencies, reference is made to Note
         (M) to the condensed consolidated financial statements for June 30,
         2002 and 2001 and Note 10 -"Contingencies" to the consolidated
         financial statements for December 31, 2001, all contained in the
         Southern Power Prospectus.

         SOUTHERN has received a subpoena to provide information to a federal
         grand jury in the Northern District of California (San Francisco). The
         subpoena covers a number of broad areas, including specific information
         regarding electricity production and sales activities in California.
         SOUTHERN's former subsidiary, Mirant, participated in energy marketing
         and trading in California during the period relevant to the subpoena.
         Mirant was spun off from SOUTHERN in April 2001. SOUTHERN will
         cooperate fully in the investigation. Reference is made to Note (B)
         herein and to Note 11 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8
         and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Overview of Consolidated
         Earnings and Dividends" of SOUTHERN in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for
         information on the spin off of Mirant from SOUTHERN.

         In recent months, affiliates of SOUTHERN, including GEORGIA, GULF,
         MISSISSIPPI, SAVANNAH and Southern Telecom, Inc. (collectively,
         "Defendants"), have been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits
         brought by landowners regarding the installation and use of fiber optic
         cable over Defendants'

                                      107

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         rights of way located on the landowners' property. The plaintiffs'
         lawsuits claim that Defendants may not use or sublease to third parties
         some or all of the fiber optic communications lines on the rights of
         way that cross the plaintiffs' properties, and that such actions by
         Defendants exceed the easements or other property rights held by
         Defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for, among other things,
         trespass and unjust enrichment, and the plaintiffs seek compensatory
         and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Defendants believe that the
         plaintiffs' claims are without merit and are vigorously defending these
         cases. An adverse outcome in these matters could result in substantial
         judgments; however, at this time, the ultimate outcome of these cases
         cannot be determined.

(F)      SOUTHERN has made separate guarantees to certain counterparties
         regarding performance of contractual commitments by Mirant's
         trading and marketing subsidiaries.  At September 30, 2002, the total
         notional amount of guarantees was $52.0 million, all of which will
         expire by 2007.  The estimated fair value of net contractual
         commitments outstanding was approximately $15.5 million.  SOUTHERN's
         potential exposure under these contractual commitments is not expected
         to materially differ from the estimated fair value.  Subsequent to the
         spin off, Mirant began paying SOUTHERN a monthly fee of 1% on the
         average aggregate maximum principal amount of all guarantees
         outstanding until they are replaced or expire.  Mirant must use
         reasonable efforts to release SOUTHERN from all such support
         arrangements and will indemnify SOUTHERN for any obligations incurred.
         Reference is made to Note 6 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in
         Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note 9 to the financial statements of
         SOUTHERN under the caption "Guarantees" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(G)      Reference is made to Item 1 - Business - "Rate Proceedings" and Note 3
         to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the
         Form 10-K for information relating to retail rate adjustment
         procedures.  On March 5, 2002, the Alabama PSC approved a revision to
         ALABAMA's rates that provide for periodic adjustments based upon
         ALABAMA's earned return on end-of-period retail common equity.  This
         revision provides for an annual, rather than quarterly, adjustment
         and imposes a 3 percent limit on any such annual adjustment.  The
         return on common equity range of 13.0 to 14.5 percent remains
         unchanged.  In April 2002, retail rates were increased by 2 percent
         in accordance with the Rate Stabilization and Equalization Plan.
         The Alabama PSC also accepted ALABAMA's proposal to lower the energy
         cost recovery factor for the billing months April 2002 through
         December 2002.

(H)      On December 20, 2001, the Georgia PSC approved a new three-year retail
         rate order for GEORGIA ending December 31, 2004.  Under the terms of
         the order, earnings will be evaluated annually against a retail return
         on common equity range of 10 percent to 12.95 percent.  Two-thirds of
         any earnings above the 12.95 percent return will be applied to rate
         refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by GEORGIA.  Retail
         rates were decreased by $118 million effective January 1, 2002.
         Pursuant to a previous three-year accounting order, GEORGIA recorded
         $332 million of accelerated cost amortization and interest thereon
         which has been credited to a regulatory liability account as mandated
         by the Georgia PSC.  Under the new rate order, the accelerated
         amortization and the interest will be amortized equally over three
         years as a credit to expense beginning in January 2002.  Effective
         January 1, 2002, GEORGIA discontinued recording accelerated
         depreciation and amortization.  GEORGIA will not file for a general
         base rate increase unless its projected retail return on common equity
         falls below 10 percent.  GEORGIA is required to file a general rate
         case on July 1, 2004, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be
         expected to determine whether the rate order should be continued,
         modified or discontinued.  See Note 3 to the financial statements of
         GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K under "Retail Rate Orders" for
         additional information.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(I)      Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
         GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
         designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
         Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
         environmental contingencies.

(J)      On September 10, 2001, GULF filed a request with the Florida PSC for a
         base rate increase of $69.9 million.  This increase was necessary to
         cover costs related to GULF's new combined-cycle facility, Plant Smith
         Unit 3, increases in operation and maintenance expenses and other
         capital additions.  GULF subsequently reduced its request to $64.9
         million, primarily to reflect lower financing costs related to Smith
         Unit 3 and a 25-year depreciable life for Smith Unit 3 (rather than the
         20-year life as originally filed).  On April 26, 2002, the Florida PSC
         voted to grant GULF a $53.2 million, or 8.9 percent, annual increase,
         which reflects an authorized return on equity of 12.0 percent.  The
         new rates resulting from the revenue increase were approved by the
         Florida PSC on May 8, 2002 and became effective on June 7, 2002.

(K)      In August 2001, MISSISSIPPI filed a request with the Mississippi PSC
         to increase annual retail rate revenues by approximately $46.4 million.
         In order to consider MISSISSIPPI's request, the Mississippi PSC
         suspended the semi-annual evaluations under PEP.  In December 2001,
         the Mississippi PSC approved an increase of approximately $39 million,
         which took effect in January 2002.  Additionally, the Mississippi PSC
         ordered MISSISSIPPI to reactivate the semi-annual evaluations
         under PEP, beginning with the 12-month period ending December 31, 2002.
         PEP will remain in effect until the Mississippi PSC modifies, suspends
         or terminates the plan.  On April 30, 2002, the Mississippi PSC
         held and concluded hearings on a review of the return on equity models
         used in PEP in setting MISSISSIPPI's authorized return on equity.
         In May 2002, the Mississippi PSC issued an order adopting new return
         on equity models to be used in the PEP process.  The new models are
         very similar to those that established the $39 million rate increase
         authorized in December 2001 and will be incorporated into the PEP
         evaluation filing for the period ending December 31, 2002.

 (L)     Reference is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
         "Future Earnings  Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K regarding
         the settlement  agreement  between  MISSISSIPPI and certain  wholesale
         customers to increase its  wholesale  tariff rates  effective  June 1,
         2002. On April 19, 2002,  the FERC accepted for filing the  settlement
         agreement  and  placed  the new  tariff  rates in effect  June 1, 2002
         without  modifying the agreement  reached between  MISSISSIPPI and its
         customers.  The settlement  agreement results in an annual increase of
         approximately  $10.5  million  and  the  adoption  of an  Energy  Cost
         Management clause similar to the one approved by MISSISSIPPI's  retail
         jurisdiction.  Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements
         of MISSISSIPPI  in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for further  information on
         the  Energy  Cost  Management   clause.   The  FERC's   acceptance  of
         MISSISSIPPI's filing constitutes final agency action on this matter.

(M)      SAVANNAH filed a base rate case on November 30, 2001.  The primary
         reason for this base rate case was to recover significant
         new revenue requirements related to a 200 MW Plant Wansley PPA which
         began in June 2002, as well as other operation and maintenance changes.
         SAVANNAH also filed for a fuel cost recovery decrease to offset most,
         if not all, of the base rate increase.  On May 30, 2002, the Georgia
         PSC approved a $7.8 million base rate increase and an authorized
         return on equity of 12.0 percent rather than the $24.4 million and
         13.5 percent return on equity which were requested.  At the same time,
         the Georgia PSC also approved a $44.3 million fuel cost allowance
         reduction.  SAVANNAH had requested a $41.3 million fuel cost
         reduction.  All customers saw a net rate decrease effective June 2002.
         On June 10, 2002, SAVANNAH filed for reconsideration
         of the Georgia PSC base rate case order, seeking additional revenues.
         On August 6, 2002, the Georgia PSC voted to deny

                                      109
<PAGE>


NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)

         SAVANNAH's request for reconsideration in this matter. SAVANNAH has
         decided not to file an appeal of the reconsideration decision and
         during the fourth quarter 2002 will review the potential need for
         another rate case in 2003. SAVANNAH is also pursuing a regulatory
         solution to recover the remaining Plant Wansley PPA costs.

(N)      In addition to the fixed price electric and gas contracts used to
         mitigate exposure to volatile energy prices (see "Exposure to Market
         Risks" in MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS herein), SOUTHERN and
         certain of its subsidiaries enter into interest rate swaps to hedge
         exposure to interest rate changes. Swaps related to fixed rate
         securities are accounted for as fair value hedges; swaps related to
         variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for
         as cash flow hedges. The swaps are generally structured to mirror the
         terms of the hedged debt instruments; therefore, no ineffectiveness has
         been recorded in earnings. As of September 30, 2002, the following
         swaps were outstanding:

         and services, and leasing and financing services. Intersegment revenues
         are not material.

(P)      SOUTHERN has committed to directly fund 40% of the construction costs
         of the facilities funded under SOUTHERN POWER's  revolving credit
         facility with Citibank N.A. In addition, SOUTHERN has guaranteed the
         timely completion of SOUTHERN POWER's projects currently financed
         under such revolving credit facility.  In this guarantee, SOUTHERN
         agrees to pay for cost overruns to the extent that SOUTHERN POWER's
         cash flow is insufficient. SOUTHERN also agrees to prepay any portion
         of the credit facility used for SOUTHERN POWER projects not completed
         within two years of the proposed projects' completion dates.
         At September 30, 2002, the outstanding amount of this revolving credit
         facility related to projects under construction was  $276 million.
         Reference is made to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements
         for December 31, 2001 contained in the Southern Power Prospectus for
         additional information.

(Q)      Certain keep-well agreements were created to facilitate the assignment
         of specific partially executory vendor contracts to SOUTHERN POWER. As
         of September 30, 2002, SOUTHERN keep-well agreements were in place to
         facilitate the transfer of specific vendor contracts from ALABAMA to
         SOUTHERN POWER related to the Plant Harris construction. SOUTHERN
         keep-wells are also in place for the transfer of specific vendor
         contracts from GEORGIA to SOUTHERN POWER for the operation of Plant
         Dahlberg and construction at the Plant Franklin and Plant Stanton
         sites. As of September 30, 2002, estimated remaining payments are $32.6
         million related to the GEORGIA contracts and none related to the
         ALABAMA contracts.

         Certain other keep-well arrangements were entered into in order to
         enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the energy sales and related
         natural gas procurement function. Acting as agent for the operating
         companies, SOUTHERN POWER and Southern Gas under agency agreements
         ("Agreements"), SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy
         and natural gas contracts. Under such Agreements, each of the operating
         companies, SOUTHERN POWER and Southern Gas may be jointly and severally
         liable for the obligations of each of the operating companies, SOUTHERN

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         POWER and Southern Gas. In that regard, the creditworthiness of
         SOUTHERN POWER and Southern Gas is currently inferior to the
         creditworthiness of the operating companies. To insure that the
         operating companies will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs,
         losses, liabilities or damages arising out of or resulting from
         SOUTHERN POWER's or Southern Gas' inclusion as a contracting party
         under the Agreements, SOUTHERN has entered into keep-well agreements
         with each of the operating companies.

         Based on SOUTHERN POWER's and Southern Gas' share of natural gas and
         wholesale energy purchase commitments, SOUTHERN's maximum exposure
         under the Agreements was $34.5 million as of September 30, 2002.
