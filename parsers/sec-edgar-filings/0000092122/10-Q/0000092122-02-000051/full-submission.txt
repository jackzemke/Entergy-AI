           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

   This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking and historical
information. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by
terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expects," "plans,"
"anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "projects," "predicts," "potential" or
"continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.
SOUTHERN cautions that there are various important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking
statements; accordingly, there can be no assurance that such indicated results
will be realized. These factors include the impact of recent and future federal
and state regulatory change, including legislative and regulatory initiatives
regarding deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry and
also changes in environmental and other laws and regulations to which SOUTHERN
and its subsidiaries are subject, as well as changes in application of existing
laws and regulations; current and future litigation, including the pending EPA
civil action against certain SOUTHERN subsidiaries and the race discrimination
litigation against certain SOUTHERN subsidiaries; the effect, extent and timing
of the entry of additional competition in the markets in which SOUTHERN's
subsidiaries operate; the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices, interest
rates, and customer demand; state and federal rate regulations; political,
legal, and economic conditions and developments in the United States; the
performance of projects undertaken by the non-traditional business and the
success of efforts to invest in and develop new opportunities; internal
restructuring or other restructuring options that may be pursued; potential
business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or
business, which cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial to SOUTHERN or
its subsidiaries; the effects of, and changes in, economic conditions in the
areas in which SOUTHERN's subsidiaries operate; the direct and indirect effects
on SOUTHERN's business resulting from the terrorist incidents on September 11,
2001, or any similar such incidents or responses to such incidents; financial
market conditions and the results of financing efforts; the timing and
acceptance of SOUTHERN's new product and service offerings; the ability of
SOUTHERN to obtain additional generating capacity at competitive prices; weather
and other natural phenomena; and other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in
other reports (including the Form 10-K) filed from time to time with the SEC.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   FIRST QUARTER 2002 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2001

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SOUTHERN is focusing on three main businesses in the Southeast: its traditional
business, represented by its five operating companies providing electric service
in four states; a growing competitive generation business in the eight state
"Super Southeast" region; and energy-related products and services for its
retail customers.

Earnings

SOUTHERN's first quarter 2002 earnings from continuing operations were $224
million ($0.32 per share) compared with $180 million ($0.26 per share) in the
first quarter of 2001. The first quarter 2002 increase in earnings is primarily
due to increased energy sales in the residential and commercial sectors, lower
interest costs and the overall impact of regulatory rate proceedings in Alabama,
Georgia and Mississippi, partially offset by decreased demand by industrial
customers, as well as increased operation and maintenance expenses. During the
first quarter of 2002, weather had no significant impact when compared to the
same period in 2001.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                   Increase (Decrease)
                                           -----------------------------------
                                                      First Quarter
                                           -----------------------------------
                                               (in thousands)          %
Retail sales..........................         $(42,026)              (2.2)
Sales for resale......................          (27,367)             (10.5)
Other revenues........................           13,463               10.9
Fuel expense..........................          (33,288)              (5.5)
Purchased power.......................          (46,409)             (40.7)
Other operation expense...............           39,821                9.8
Depreciation and amortization.........          (63,277)             (20.8)
Equity in losses of unconsolidated
 subsidiaries.........................           13,207              489.7
Interest expense, net.................          (25,317)             (13.1)

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue was down by $4 million, or 0.3%, in the first
quarter of 2002 compared to the same period in the prior year. Retail sales
revenue in the first quarter 2002 was lower primarily due to lower energy sales
to industrial customers. The decrease in industrial energy sales is primarily
attributed to the slowdown in the manufacturing sector of the economy.

     Sales for resale. The primary reason for the decrease in sales for resale
revenues in the first quarter 2002 is lower demand from these customers when
compared to the corresponding period in 2001.

     Other revenues. The increase in other revenues during the first quarter
2002 when compared to the same period in 2001 is attributed primarily to growth
in subsidiaries that are focused on alternative fuel products and energy
products and services. In April 2001, SOUTHERN formed a new subsidiary to hold
its investment in a partnership producing alternative fuel products. Revenues
from this subsidiary were $14 million in the first quarter of 2002.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Fuel expense. Fuel expense decreased in the first quarter of 2002 primarily
due to the lower price of natural gas when compared to the same period in the
prior year.

     Purchased power expense. In the first quarter of 2002, purchased power
expense decreased mainly due to lower costs associated with these energy
purchases and commercial operation of the new units at Plant Daniel in May 2001
when compared to the corresponding period in 2001. Since energy expenses are
usually offset by energy revenues through the operating companies cost recovery
mechanisms, these expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operation expense. The first quarter 2002 increase is mainly
attributed to subsidiaries involved in energy products and services and
alternative fuel products. As discussed previously, SOUTHERN formed a new
subsidiary in April 2001 to hold its investment in a partnership producing
alternative fuel products.

     Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased in
the first quarter of 2002 primarily as a result of discontinuing accelerated
depreciation and beginning amortization of the regulatory liability for
accelerated cost recovery in January 2002, in accordance with GEORGIA's new
retail rate order. Reference is made to Note (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein.

     Equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries. The increase for the first
quarter of 2002, compared to the same period in 2001, is primarily attributed to
SOUTHERN's investments in partnerships producing alternative fuel products. As
discussed previously, SOUTHERN formed a new subsidiary in April 2001 to hold its
investment in a partnership producing alternative fuel products.

     Interest expense, net. During the first quarter 2002, interest expense, net
decreased primarily due to a reduction in interest rates compared to the same
period in 2001.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors. The two major factors are the ability of the operating companies to
achieve energy sales growth while containing costs in a more competitive
environment and the profitability of the new competitive market-based wholesale
generating facilities being added. For additional information relating to the
other businesses, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Southern Power" and "Other Business"
in the Form 10-K. Also, reference is made to Note (B) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for information relating to the spin off
of Mirant from SOUTHERN.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     On April 25, 2002, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee met and selected the
final four candidates that will be considered for the SeTrans ISA. Reference is
made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Certain Factors Affecting the Industry" and Item 7

and other matters which may affect future earnings potential. Reference is also
made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

SOUTHERN's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. SOUTHERN's only
critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. The operating companies are
subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation". In the event that a portion of a company's
operations is no longer subject to these provisions, the company would be
required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
specifically recoverable, and determine if any other assets, including plant,
have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, SOUTHERN adopted FASB Statement No. 133 "Accounting
for Derivatives and Hedging Activities", as amended, and changed the method of
accounting for derivative instruments. Derivatives are now reflected on the
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as either an asset or liability measured at
fair market value, and the changes in the fair value are currently recognized in
earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. An additional
interpretation of Statement No. 133 may result in a change -- effective on April
1, 2002 -- in accounting for certain contracts related to fuel supplies that
contain quantity options. If these contracts are derivatives, they will be
marked to market. However, due to the existence of specific cost-based fuel
recovery clauses for the operating companies, this change is not expected to
have a material impact on net income.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset Retirement
Obligations," which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with retiring assets, including decommissioning nuclear
plants. The liability for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in the
period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as part
of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life.
Changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time will be recognized
as operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by January 1, 2003.
SOUTHERN is currently assessing the impact of adopting Statement No. 143 on its
financial statements. Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of
SOUTHERN under "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form
10-K.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first three months of
2002 included $680 million used for gross property additions to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were primarily from
other long-term debt. See SOUTHERN's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows for further details.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In May 2001, MISSISSIPPI began the initial 10-year term of an operating lease
agreement signed in 1999 with Escatawpa Funding Limited Partnership, a special
purpose entity, to use a combined-cycle generating facility located at
MISSISSIPPI's Plant Daniel. The facility cost approximately $370 million. The
lease provides for a residual value guarantee -- approximately 71% of the
completion cost -- by MISSISSIPPI that is due upon termination of the lease in
certain circumstances. Reference is made to Note 9 to the financial statements
in Item 8 of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K and Note 4 to the financial statements in
Item 8 of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K for additional information. The FASB is
in the process of issuing a draft addressing issues related to identifying and
accounting for certain special purpose entities. One contemplated change would
increase the three percent outside equity requirement to 10 percent. This
interpretation is in draft form; therefore, final conclusions may differ from
the draft. However, certain changes to the accounting guidance could result in
MISSISSIPPI having to change its accounting for this lease agreement, including
having to consolidate the leased asset and related debt.

     In 2001, Southern Power entered into a financial arrangement with
Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB) whereby Southern Power could
assign up to $125 million in vendor contracts for equipment to WestLB. For
accounting purposes, WestLB was the owner of the contracts. Southern Power acted
as an agent for WestLB and instructed WestLB when to make payments to the
vendors. Southern Power terminated this arrangement and reacquired these assets
in March 2002.

Credit Rating Risk

SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries do not have any credit agreements that would
require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a
credit rating downgrade. There are certain fixed-price physical gas purchase
contracts that could require collateral - but not accelerated payment - in the
event of a credit rating change to below investment grade. These contracts are
primarily for physical electricity sales, fixed-price physical gas purchases,
and agreements covering interest rate swaps and currency swaps. At March 31,
2002, the maximum potential collateral requirements under the electricity sale
contracts were approximately $288 million. Generally, collateral may be provided
for by a SOUTHERN guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At March 31, 2002, there
were no material collateral requirements for the gas purchase contracts or other
financial instrument agreements.

Exposure to Market Risks

SOUTHERN's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the previous reporting period, December 31,
2001. In addition, SOUTHERN is not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


    Due to cost-based rate regulations, the operating companies have limited
exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and
prices of electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in
electricity prices for the operating companies, they and Southern Power enter
into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the
wholesale electricity market and to a lesser extent similar contracts for gas
purchases. Also, some of the operating companies have implemented fuel-hedging
programs at the instruction of their respective public service commissions.
Realized gains and losses are recognized in the income statements as incurred.
At March 31, 2002, exposure from these activities was not material to the
consolidated financial statements. Fair value of changes in energy trading
contracts and valuations at March 31, 2002 are as follows:

Financing Activities

In January 2002, GULF issued $45 million of Series E 6.00% Senior Notes due
January 30, 2012. The proceeds from the sale will be used by GULF to finance
certain construction costs incurred in connection with Plant Smith Unit 3,
GULF's 574 megawatt combined cycle facility currently under construction, and
for general corporate purposes.

    Also, in January 2002, Southern Company Capital Funding, Inc. issued $400
million of Series A 5.30% Senior Notes due February 1, 2007 and $25 million of
Series B Floating Rate Senior Notes due February 1, 2004. The proceeds from
these sales were remitted to SOUTHERN and applied by SOUTHERN to repay a portion
of its outstanding short-term indebtedness.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     In March 2002, MISSISSIPPI issued $80 million of Series D Floating Rate
Senior Notes due March 12, 2004. The proceeds of the sale were used to repay $80
million of Series C Floating Rate Senior Notes due March 28, 2002. Also in March
2002, Mississippi Power Capital Trust II, a statutory business trust, sold $35
million of its 7.20% trust originated preferred securities which are guaranteed
by MISSISSIPPI for the purpose of redeeming in May 2002 $35 million of
Mississippi Power Capital Trust I 7.75% trust originated preferred securities.

     During the first quarter of 2002, Southern Power drew down $287 million
under its revolving credit facility to finance project construction
costs.  Southern Power anticipates that it will issue unsecured senior notes by
the end of the second quarter of 2002. The net proceeds of the senior notes will
be used to reduce outstanding indebtedness under the company's credit facility
and for general corporate purposes.

     The market price of SOUTHERN's common stock at March 31, 2002 was $26.49
per share and the book value was $11.52 per share, representing a market-to-book
ratio of 230%, compared to $25.35, $11.43 and 222%, respectively, at the end of
2001. The dividend for the first quarter of 2002 was $0.335 per share.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements for Construction", "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for a description of the SOUTHERN system's
capital requirements for its construction program, sinking fund requirements,
maturing debt and environmental compliance efforts. Approximately $267 million
will be required by March 31, 2003 for redemptions and maturities of long-term
debt. Also, the operating companies plan to continue, to the extent possible, a
program to retire higher cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost
capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital over the next several years. The amounts and
timing of additional equity capital to be raised will be contingent on
SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The operating companies plan to obtain the
funds required for construction and other purposes from sources similar to those
used in the past, which were primarily from internal sources and by the
issuances of new debt and preferred equity securities, term loans and short-term
borrowings. However, the amount, type and timing of any financings--if
needed--will depend upon market conditions and regulatory approval. See Item 1 -
BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
March 31, 2002 approximately $296 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $4.3 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks, of which
$3.1 billion expires in 2002 and $1.2 billion expires in 2003 and beyond. These
unused credit arrangements also provide liquidity support to variable rate
pollution control bonds and commercial paper programs. The operating companies
may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of each of
the operating companies. At March 31, 2002, the SOUTHERN system had short-term
notes payable outstanding of $395 million and commercial paper outstanding of
$1.4 billion. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2002 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2001



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter of
2002 was $72.5 million compared to $70.0 million for the corresponding period of
2001. The increase in earnings for the first quarter of 2002 is primarily
attributable to increased territorial sales and retail rates when compared to
the same period in the prior year, which were partially offset by increased
non-fuel operating expenses.


     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                    Increase (Decrease)
                                            -----------------------------------

                                                (in thousands)          %

Other, net.............................           (6,870)            (260.2)


     Retail sales. Excluding energy cost recovery revenues, which generally do
not affect net income, retail sales revenue was higher by $26.5 million, or
5.8%, for the first quarter 2002 when compared to the same period in 2001.
Energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers increased by
3.6%, 0.5% and 1.6%, respectively, due primarily to more favorable weather
conditions in 2002. Total retail sales revenue was down, however,
during the first quarter of 2002 due to a decrease in fuel expense recovery.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. In the first quarter of 2002, the demand
for energy by non-affiliates was lower when compared to the same period in 2001.
These transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings since the
energy is usually sold at variable cost.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies within the SOUTHERN system, as
well as purchases of energy, will vary depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These transactions did not
have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. During the first quarter of 2002, revenues from gas-fueled
cogeneration steam facilities were lower when compared to the same period in
2001 due primarily to lower gas prices and lower demand. Since cogeneration
steam revenues are generally offset by fuel expenses, these revenues did not
have a significant impact on earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel expense. Fuel expense decreased due mainly to the lower price of
natural gas in this first quarter of 2002 when compared to the same period of
2001. Since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues, these
expenses did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. In the first quarter of 2002, purchased
power from non-affiliates when compared to the corresponding period in 2001
decreased due to lower costs associated with these energy purchases. These
expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are
generally offset by energy revenues through ALABAMA's energy cost recovery
clause.

     Other operation expense. Other operation expense increased during the first
quarter of 2002 primarily as a result of lower refunds related to nuclear
property and outage insurance when compared to the first quarter of 2001.

     Other, net. The first quarter of 2002 decrease is due in part to a decrease
in Allowance for Funds Used During Construction reflecting the commercial
operation of Plant Barry Unit 7 in May 2001.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, ALABAMA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     On April 25, 2002, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee met and selected the
final four candidates that will be considered for the SeTrans ISA. Reference is
made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Certain Factors Affecting the Industry" and Item 7
- - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Industry Restructuring" of ALABAMA in
the Form 10-K for additional information.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of ALABAMA in the
Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation. On April 29, 2002, the U. S.
District Court in Alabama extended the stay of the proceeding in Alabama through
late July 2002.

Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential. Reference is also
made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

ALABAMA's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. ALABAMA's only
critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. ALABAMA is subject to the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation". In the event that a portion of ALABAMA's operation is no
longer subject to these provisions, ALABAMA would be required to write off
related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
and determine if any other assets have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, ALABAMA adopted FASB Statement No. 133 "Accounting
for Derivatives and Hedging Activities," as amended, and changed the method of
accounting for derivative instruments. Derivatives are now reflected on the
Condensed Balance Sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair market
value, and the changes in the fair value are currently recognized in earnings
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. An additional interpretation
of Statement No. 133 may result in a change -- effective on April 1, 2002 -- in
accounting for certain contracts related to fuel supplies that contain quantity
options. If these contracts are derivatives, they will be marked to market.
However, due to the existence of specific cost-based fuel recovery clauses for
ALABAMA, this change is not expected to have a material impact on net income.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset Retirement
Obligations," which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with retiring assets, including decommissioning nuclear
plants. The liability for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in the
period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as part
of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life.
Changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time will be recognized
as operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by January 1, 2003.
ALABAMA is currently assessing the impact of adopting Statement No. 143 on its
financial statements. Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of
ALABAMA under "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form
10-K.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first three months of
2002 included the addition of approximately $174 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Credit Rating Risk

ALABAMA does not have any credit agreements that would require material changes
in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Exposure to Market Risks

ALABAMA's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the December 31, 2001 reporting period. In
addition, ALABAMA is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, ALABAMA has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity.
To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, ALABAMA
entered into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity
through the wholesale electricity market. Realized gains and losses are
recognized in the Statements of Income as incurred. At March 31, 2002, exposure
from these activities was not material to ALABAMA's financial statements. Fair
value of changes in energy trading contracts and valuations at March 31, 2002
are as follows:

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of ALABAMA
under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital requirements
for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental compliance
efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at March 31,
2002 approximately $32 million of cash and cash equivalents, unused committed
lines of credit of approximately $964 million (including $454 million of such
lines which are dedicated to funding purchase obligations relating to variable
rate pollution control bonds) and an extendible commercial note program. Of
these lines of credit, $574 million expire at various times during 2002 and $390
million expire in 2004. ALABAMA may also meet short-term cash needs through a
SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible
commercial notes at the request and for the benefit of ALABAMA and other
SOUTHERN subsidiaries. ALABAMA has regulatory authority for up to $1.0 billion
of short-term borrowings. At March 31, 2002, ALABAMA had outstanding $97 million
of commercial paper.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2002 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2001



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter
2002 was $126.7 million compared to $107.7 million for the corresponding period
in 2001. Earnings increased by $19.1 million, or 17.7%, for the first quarter
2002 when compared to the same period in 2001 primarily due to reduced
accelerated depreciation under the 2001 retail rate order. This increase will be
offset in future quarters due to the timing of accelerated depreciation recorded
in 2001.


     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                       Increase (Decrease)
                                               --------------------------------
                                                          First Quarter
                                               --------------------------------
                                                   (in thousands)          %
Retail sales..............................          (44,231)              (4.7)
Sales for resale - non-affiliates.........          (37,541)             (42.9)
Sales for resale - affiliates.............          (19,270)             (53.9)
Purchased power - non-affiliates..........          (16,315)             (30.2)
Purchased power - affiliates..............          (20,515)             (25.9)
Depreciation and amortization.............          (73,698)             (44.9)
Interest expense, net.....................          (10,304)             (20.2)


     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue decreased in the first quarter of 2002 by $44.8
million, or 6.4%, when compared to the same period in 2001. The decrease in the
first quarter 2002 retail sales revenue is primarily due to a 5% decrease in
energy sales to industrial customers and a rate decrease pursuant to the new
retail rate order effective January 1, 2002. The effect of the rate decrease in
the first quarter 2002 was approximately $25 million. The continued slowdown in
manufacturing activity was the principal factor affecting energy sales to
industrial customers. During the first quarter of 2002, weather had no
significant impact when compared to the same period in 2001. Reference is made
to Note (H) in the "Notes to Condensed Financial Statements" herein.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. In the first quarter of 2002, sales for
resale to non-affiliates decreased in part as a direct result of reduced energy
sales to these customers. These transactions did not have a significant impact
on earnings since the energy is usually sold at variable cost. The transfer of
Plant Dahlberg to Southern Power also resulted in lower sales in the first
quarter of 2002.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These transactions did not
have a significant impact on earnings.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power - non-affiliates. During the first quarter of 2002, these
purchases were lower when compared to the same period in 2001 due primarily to
reduced demand for energy from non-affiliates. In 2001, these expenses were also
higher due to decreased hydro generation and higher natural gas and oil prices.
These expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy
expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through GEORGIA's fuel cost
recovery clause.

     Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased in
the first quarter of 2002 primarily as a result of discontinuing accelerated
depreciation and beginning amortization of the regulatory liability for
accelerated cost recovery in January 2002, in accordance with GEORGIA's new
retail rate order. Reference is made to Note (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein.

     Interest expense, net. The decrease in this item during the first quarter
of 2002 from the first quarter of 2001 is primarily due to a reduction in
interest rates and the accrual of interest on accelerated amortization in 2001
under the prior rate order.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GEORGIA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form
10-K.

     In January 2002, GEORGIA began operating under a new three-year retail rate
order. Under the terms of the order, earnings will be evaluated annually against
a retail return on common equity range of 10 percent to 12.95 percent.
Two-thirds of any earnings above the 12.95 percent return will be applied to
rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by GEORGIA. Retail rates
were decreased by $118 million effective January 1, 2002. Reference is made to
Note (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein and Item 7
- - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA
in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     In January 2002, GEORGIA transferred ownership of two units at Plant
Wansley with a net book value of $389.9 million to Southern Power, an affiliated
company.

     On April 25, 2002, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee met and selected the
final four candidates that will be considered for the SeTrans ISA. Reference is
made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Certain Factors Affecting the Industry" and Item 7

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Issues" of GEORGIA and Note 3 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item 8
of the Form 10-K for information on the EPA litigation.

     Reference is made to Notes (C) through (E), (H) and (I) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

GEORGIA's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. GEORGIA's only
critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. GEORGIA is subject to the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation". In the event that a portion of GEORGIA's operations is no
longer subject to these provisions, GEORGIA would be required to write off
related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable,
and determine if any other assets, including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, GEORGIA adopted FASB Statement No. 133 "Accounting
for Derivatives and Hedging Activities," as amended, and changed the method of
accounting for derivative instruments. Derivatives are now reflected on the
Condensed Balance Sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair market
value, and the changes in the fair value are currently recognized in earnings
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. An additional interpretation
of Statement No. 133 may result in a change -- effective on April 1, 2002 -- in
accounting for certain contracts related to fuel supplies that contain quantity
options. If these contracts are derivatives, they will be marked to market.
However, due to the existence of specific cost-based fuel recovery clauses for
GEORGIA, this change is not expected to have a material impact on net income.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset Retirement
Obligations," which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with retiring assets, including decommissioning nuclear
plants. The liability for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in the
period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as part
of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life.
Changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time will be recognized
as operating expenses. Statement No. 143 must be adopted by January 1, 2003.
GEORGIA is currently assessing the impact of adopting Statement No. 143 on its
financial statements. Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of
GEORGIA under "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form
10-K.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major changes in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first three months
of 2002 were the sale of two units at Plant Wansley to Southern Power and the
addition of approximately $215 million to utility plant. The funds for these
additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from operations.
See GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Credit Rating Risk

GEORGIA does not have any credit agreements that would require material changes
in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.
There are certain physical electricity sale contracts that could require
collateral -- but not termination -- in the event of a credit rating change to
below investment grade. At March 31, 2002, the maximum potential collateral
requirements were approximately $111 million.

Exposure to Market Risks

GEORGIA's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the previous reporting period, December 31,
2001. In addition, GEORGIA is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, GEORGIA has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity.
To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, GEORGIA
entered into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity
through the wholesale electricity market and to a lesser extent similar
contracts for gas purchases. Realized gains and losses are recognized in the
Statements of Income as incurred. At March 31, 2002, exposure from these
activities was not material to GEORGIA's financial statements. Fair value of
changes in energy trading contracts and valuations at March 31, 2002 are as
follows:

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Exposure
to Market Risks" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K and Note 1 to the financial
statements of GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Issues" in the Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital
requirements for its construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

GEORGIA plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at March 31,
2002 approximately $45.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$1.765 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks, of which $1.265 billion
expires in 2002 and $500 million expires in 2003 and beyond. The credit
arrangements provide liquidity support to GEORGIA's obligations with respect to
variable rate pollution control bonds and its commercial paper program. GEORGIA
may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of GEORGIA
and other SOUTHERN subsidiaries. At March 31, 2002, GEORGIA had outstanding $1
billion of notes payable. Management believes that the need for working capital
can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large
cash balances.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2002 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2001



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter 2002
was $11.7 million compared to $10.2 million for the same period in 2001.
Earnings for the first quarter 2002 increased by $1.5 million, or 14.9%, due
primarily to an increase in other income.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                     Increase (Decrease)
                                             ----------------------------------
                                                        First Quarter
                                             ----------------------------------
                                                 (in thousands)          %
Retail sales............................           $4,664                3.6
Sales for resale - non-affiliates.......           (2,713)             (13.5)
Sales for resale - affiliates...........           (6,029)             (70.0)
Fuel expense............................          (12,577)             (25.5)
Purchased power - non-affiliates........           (2,697)             (31.7)
Purchased power - affiliates............            5,495               47.5
Maintenance expense.....................            4,730               35.1
Other, net..............................            2,426              303.6


     Retail sales. Excluding the recovery of fuel expense and certain other
expenses that do not affect net income, retail sales increased by $5.1 million,
or 6.7%, for the first quarter 2002. During the first quarter 2002, retail sales
revenue was higher primarily due to growth in the number of residential
customers served by GULF, as well as revenues subject to refund of $2.5 million
in 2001. There are no revenues subject to refund for the first quarter of 2002.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. In the first quarter 2002, sales for
resale to non-affiliates decreased when compared to the corresponding period in
2001 due mainly to reduced demand for energy by these customers. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is
usually sold at variable cost.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These transactions do not have
a significant impact on earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel expense. The decrease in fuel expense during the first quarter of 2002
is mainly attributed to reduced generation of energy, as well as lower average
fuel costs when compared to the same period in 2001. Since energy expenses are
generally offset by energy revenues through GULF's fuel cost recovery mechanism,
these expenses do not have a significant impact on net income.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. During the first quarter 2002, purchased
power from non-affiliates decreased due primarily to lower costs for this energy
when compared to the same period in 2001. Since energy expenses are generally
offset by energy revenues through GULF's purchased power capacity clause
recovery mechanism, these expenses do not have a significant impact on net
income.

     Maintenance expense. The first quarter 2002 increase in maintenance expense
primarily resulted from increased scheduled production maintenance when compared
to the first quarter of the previous year.

     Other, net. Other, net increased during the first quarter 2002 when
compared to the same period in the prior year due mainly to a higher allowance
for equity funds used during construction related to the construction of GULF's
new combined cycle unit, Plant Smith Unit 3.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GULF is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     In 1999, the Florida PSC approved GULF's plan to reduce its authorized rate
of return, reduce retail base rates and share revenues with its customers. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     In April 2002, the Florida PSC approved an annual base rate increase for
GULF of $53.2 million to be effective in June 2002. Reference is made to Note
(J) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein and Item 7 -

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

GULF's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the financial
statements of GULF in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. GULF's only critical accounting
policy involves rate regulation. GULF is subject to the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation".
In the event that a portion of GULF's operations is no longer subject to these
provisions, GULF would be required to write off related regulatory assets and
liabilities that are not specifically recoverable, and determine if any other
assets, including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, GULF adopted FASB Statement No. 133 "Accounting for
Derivatives and Hedging Activities," as amended, and changed the method of
accounting for derivative instruments. Derivatives are now reflected on the
Condensed Balance Sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair market
value, and the changes in the fair value are currently recognized in earnings
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. An additional interpretation
of Statement No. 133 may result in a change -- effective on April 1, 2002 -- in
accounting for certain contracts related to fuel supplies that contain quantity
options. If these contracts are derivatives, they will be marked to market.
However, due to the existence of specific cost-based fuel recovery clauses for
GULF, this change is not expected to have a material impact on net income.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset Retirement
Obligations," which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with retiring assets. The liability for an asset's future
retirement must be recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred.
The cost must be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting
from the passage of time will be recognized as operating expenses. Statement No.
143 must be adopted by January 1, 2003. GULF is currently assessing the impact
of adopting Statement No. 143 on its financial statements.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first three months of
2002 included the addition of approximately $39.8 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations, other long-term debt and capital contributions from SOUTHERN.
See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Credit Rating Risk

GULF does not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in
payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

GULF's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not changed
materially compared with the previous reporting period, December 31, 2001. In
addition, GULF is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, GULF has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity.
To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, GULF
entered into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity
through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, similar
contracts for gas purchases. Realized gains and losses are recognized in the
Statements of Income as incurred. At March 31, 2002, exposure from these
activities was not material to GULF's financial statements. Fair value of
changes in energy trading contracts and valuations at March 31, 2002 are as
follows:

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Exposure
to Market Risks" of GULF in the Form 10-K and Note 1 to the financial statements
of GULF in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

Financing Activities

In January 2002, GULF issued $45 million of Series E 6.00% Senior Notes due
January 30, 2012. The proceeds from the sale were used by GULF to finance
certain construction costs incurred in connection with Plant Smith Unit 3,
GULF's 574 megawatt combined cycle facility, which was placed in service in
April 2002, and for general corporate purposes. GULF plans to continue, to the
extent possible, a program to retire higher cost debt and replace these
securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital Requirements for Construction", "Other Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of GULF's capital
requirements for its construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at March 31, 2002
approximately $2.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $113 million of
unused committed lines of credit with banks that expire at various times in
2002. The credit arrangements provide liquidity support to GULF's obligations
with respect to variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper. GULF
may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of GULF and
other SOUTHERN subsidiaries. At March 31, 2002, GULF had outstanding $45.7
million of notes payable. Management believes that the need for working capital
can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large
cash balances.

                            MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2002 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2001



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first
quarter 2002 was $14.0 million compared to $9.8 million for the corresponding
period of 2001. Earnings for the first quarter 2002 increased $4.2 million, or
43.3%, primarily due to higher operating revenues and lower interest expense.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                      Increase (Decrease)
                                              ---------------------------------
                                                         First Quarter
                                              ---------------------------------
                                                  (in thousands)          %
Retail sales.............................           $3,888                3.4
Sales for resale - non-affiliates........           11,864               29.4
Sales for resale - affiliates............           (2,375)             (19.8)
Other revenues...........................           (1,631)             (36.6)
Fuel expense.............................           22,718               60.6
Purchased power - non-affiliates.........          (11,782)             (80.6)
Purchased power - affiliates.............          (24,130)             (76.5)
Other operation expense..................            8,992               34.1
Maintenance expense......................            6,823               49.3
Depreciation and amortization............            2,596               21.8


     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue was up by $10.6 million, or 17%, in the first
quarter 2002 when compared to the corresponding period in 2001 due to higher
retail energy sales and the retail rate increase which took effect in January
2002. Retail energy sales in the first quarter 2002 compared to the same period
in 2001 increased mainly due to colder than average weather.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. During the first quarter 2002, sales for
resale to non-affiliates increased mainly due to demand for energy by
non-affiliates and additional power sales as a result of the commercial
operation in May 2001 of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 when compared to the
corresponding periods in 2001.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These transactions do not have
a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. The decrease in this item in the first quarter of 2002 when
compared to the same period in 2001 is mainly due to the sale of inventory in
the first quarter of 2001.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel expense. Higher fuel expenses in the first quarter of 2002 when
compared to the same period in the prior year are primarily attributed to
increased generation. Commercial operation of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4, since
May 2001, is also a factor contributing to the increased fuel expense. Since
energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through MISSISSIPPI's
fuel cost recovery clause, these expenses do not have a significant impact on
earnings.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. In the first quarter 2002, purchased
power from non-affiliates decreased due primarily to commercial operation of the
new units at Plant Daniel in May 2001. These transactions do not have a
significant impact on net income since energy expenses are generally offset by
energy revenues through MISSISSIPPI's fuel cost recovery clause.

     Other operation expense. In the first quarter 2002, other operation expense
increased over the same period in 2001 primarily a result of lease payments
related to the commercial operation of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 which began in
May 2001.

     Maintenance expense. During the first quarter of 2002, maintenance expense
increased when compared to the corresponding period in 2001 primarily as a
result of scheduled maintenance performed at Plant Watson and Plant Daniel.

     Depreciation and amortization. The first quarter 2002 increase over the
corresponding period in 2001 is primarily due to amortization of MISSISSIPPI's
regulatory asset related to the ECO Plan. For additional information about the
ECO Plan, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters, the effect of weather, and the economy on
energy sales.

     In December 2001, the Mississippi PSC approved MISSISSIPPI'S annual retail
rate increase of approximately $39 million which became effective in January
2002. For additional information, see Note (K) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K regarding the
settlement agreement between MISSISSIPPI and certain wholesale customers to
increase its wholesale tariff rates effective June 1, 2002. In March 2002, that
agreement was filed with the FERC for approval. On April 19, 2002, the FERC
accepted for filing the settlement agreement and placed the new tariff rates in
effect June 1, 2002 without modifying the agreement reached between MISSISSIPPI
and its customers. For additional information, see Note (L) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
the federal level to expand customer choice, MISSISSIPPI is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form
10-K.

     MISSISSIPPI's 2002 ECO Plan filing was approved, as filed, by the
Mississippi PSC on March 5, 2002 and resulted in a slight increase in rates.
Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot continue to be recovered. For additional information about the
Clean Air Act and other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form
10-K.

     On April 25, 2002, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee met and selected the
final four candidates that will be considered for the SeTrans ISA. Reference is
made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Certain Factors Affecting the Industry" and Item 7
- - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Industry Restructuring" of MISSISSIPPI
in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in
the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     Reference is made to Notes (C) through (E), (K) and (L) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

MISSISSIPPI's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. MISSISSIPPI's
critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. MISSISSIPPI is subject to
the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation". In the event that a portion of MISSISSIPPI's operations is
no longer subject to these provisions, MISSISSIPPI would be required to write
off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable, and determine if any other assets, including plant, have been
impaired.

    Additionally, MISSISSIPPI accounts for its lease agreement with Escatawpa
Funding, Limited Partnership (Escatawpa) as an operating lease. Under this
agreement, Escatawpa, a special purpose entity, is owner-lessor of the
combined-cycle generating units at MISSISSIPPI's Plant Daniel. MISSISSIPPI does
not consolidate this entity since parties unrelated to MISSISSIPPI have made
substantive residual equity capital investments in excess of 3 percent. The FASB
is in the process of issuing a draft addressing issues related to identifying
and accounting for certain special purpose entities. One contemplated change
would increase the three percent outside equity requirement to 10 percent. This
interpretation is in draft form; therefore, final conclusions may differ from
the draft. However, certain changes to the accounting guidance could result in
MISSISSIPPI having to change its accounting for this lease agreement, including
having to consolidate the leased asset and related debt.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, MISSISSIPPI adopted FASB Statement No. 133
"Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities," as amended, and changed the
method of accounting for derivative instruments. Derivatives are now reflected
on the Condensed Balance Sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair
market value, and the changes in the fair value are currently recognized in
earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. An additional
interpretation of Statement No. 133 may result in a change -- effective on April
1, 2002 -- in accounting for certain contracts

                                       57

related to fuel supplies that contain quantity options. If these contracts are
derivatives, they will be marked to market. However, due to the existence of
specific cost-based fuel recovery clauses for MISSISSIPPI, this change is not
expected to have a material impact on net income.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset Retirement
Obligations," which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with retiring assets. The liability for an asset's future
retirement must be recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred.
The cost must be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting
from the passage of time will be recognized as operating expenses. Statement No.
143 must be adopted by January 1, 2003. MISSISSIPPI is currently assessing the
impact of adopting Statement No. 143 on its financial statements.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first three months
of 2002 included the addition of approximately $18.7 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
for further details.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In May 2001, MISSISSIPPI began the initial 10-year term of an operating lease
agreement signed in 1999 with Escatawpa, a special purpose entity, to use a
combined-cycle generating facility located at MISSISSIPPI's Plant Daniel. The
facility cost approximately $370 million. The lease provides for a residual
value guarantee -- approximately 71 percent of the completion cost -- by
MISSISSIPPI that is due upon termination of the lease in certain circumstances.
Reference is made to Note 4 to the financial statements in Item 8 of MISSISSIPPI
in the Form 10-K for additional information.

Credit Rating Risk

MISSISSIPPI does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade. There are certain fixed-price physical gas purchase contracts that
could require collateral - but not accelerated payment - in the event of a
credit rating change to below investment grade; however, at March 31, 2002, this
exposure was immaterial.

Exposure to Market Risks

MISSISSIPPI's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the previous reporting period, December 31,
2001. In addition, MISSISSIPPI is not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


    Due to cost-based rate regulations, MISSISSIPPI has limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, MISSISSIPPI enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale
of electricity through the wholesale electricity market. Realized gains and
losses are recognized in the income statements as incurred. At March 31, 2002,
exposure from these activities was not material to MISSISSIPPI's financial
statements. Also, based on MISSISSIPPI's overall variable rate long-term debt
exposure at March 31, 2002, a near-term 100 basis point change in interest rates
would not materially affect MISSISSIPPI's financial statements. Fair value of
changes in energy trading contracts and year-end valuations are as follows:

Financing Activities

In March 2002, MISSISSIPPI issued $80 million of Series D Floating Rate Senior
Notes due March 12, 2004. The proceeds of the sale were used to repay $80
million of Series C Floating Rate Senior Notes due March 28, 2002. Also in March
2002, Mississippi Power Capital Trust II, a statutory business trust, sold $35
million of its 7.20% trust originated preferred securities, which are guaranteed
by MISSISSIPPI, for the purpose of redeeming in May 2002, $35 million of
Mississippi Power Capital Trust I 7.75% trust originated preferred securities.
The 7.75% trust originated preferred securities are classified under current
liabilities as securities due within one year in MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Balance
Sheet herein.

     MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" and Note 3 to the financial statements
in the Form 10-K for a description of MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its
construction program, environmental compliance efforts, sinking fund
requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at March
31, 2002 approximately $45 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $88.5 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks.
Of MISSISSIPPI's committed lines of credit, $119.5 million expires in 2002 and
$5 million expires in 2003. The credit arrangements provide liquidity support to
MISSISSIPPI's obligation with respect to variable rate pollution control bonds
and commercial paper. MISSISSIPPI may also meet short-term cash needs through a
SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request
and for the benefit of MISSISSIPPI and other SOUTHERN subsidiaries. At March 31,
2002, MISSISSIPPI had outstanding $35.9 million of notes payable. Management
believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing
lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

                       SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2002 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2001



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income for the first quarter 2002 was $1.8 million as compared to
$1.5 million for the corresponding period of 2001. Earnings were up $0.3
million, or 22.1%, in the first quarter 2002 due mainly to lower operating
expenses and lower interest charges. During the first quarter of 2002, weather
had no significant impact when compared to the same period in 2001.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                      Increase (Decrease)
                                              ---------------------------------
                                                         First Quarter
                                              ---------------------------------
                                                  (in thousands)          %
Retail sales.............................          $(3,472)              (5.9)
Sales for resale - non-affiliates........             (625)             (40.1)
Sales for resale - affiliates............             (329)             (26.8)
Fuel expense.............................             (466)              (5.0)
Purchased power - non-affiliates.........           (1,259)             (54.1)
Purchased power - affiliates.............           (3,621)             (23.0)
Other operation expense..................            1,391               11.9
Maintenance expense......................             (723)             (12.0)



     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which do not affect net income,
retail sales revenue increased by $1.5 million, or 4.4%, for the first quarter
of 2002 when compared to the corresponding period in 2001 mainly due to growth
in the commercial sector.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. In the first quarter 2002, sales for
resale to non-affiliates decreased when compared to the corresponding period in
2001 as a result of lower demand from these customers outside SAVANNAH's service
area. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the
energy is usually sold at variable cost.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. These transactions do not have
a significant impact on earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel expense. Lower fuel expense in the first quarter of 2002 compared to
the same period in 2001 was primarily due to decreased generation due to lower
demand for energy and lower gas prices.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. The first quarter 2002 decrease is
primarily due to lower demand for energy in SAVANNAH's service area and lower
costs associated with these energy purchases. These transactions do not have a
significant impact on net income since energy expenses are generally offset by
energy revenues through SAVANNAH's fuel cost recovery clause.

     Other operation expense. During the first quarter 2002, the increase in
other operation expense is primarily due to higher administrative and general
expenses when compared to the corresponding period in 2001.

     Maintenance expense. The decrease in this item for the first quarter 2002
compared to the first quarter 2001 is primarily attributed to a scheduled major
maintenance outage at one of SAVANNAH's plants in 2001.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SAVANNAH is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For additional
information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental issues, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in
the Form 10-K.

     On April 25, 2002, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee met and selected the
final four candidates that will be considered for the SeTrans ISA. Reference is
made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Certain Factors Affecting the Industry" and Item 7
- - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Industry Restructuring" of SAVANNAH in
the Form 10-K for additional information.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of SAVANNAH in
the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     Reference is made to Notes (C) through (E) and (M) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential. Reference is also
made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

SAVANNAH's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. SAVANNAH's only
critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. SAVANNAH is subject to the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation". In the event that a portion of SAVANNAH's operations is no
longer subject to these provisions, SAVANNAH would be required to write off
related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable,
and determine if any other assets, including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, SAVANNAH adopted FASB Statement No. 133 "Accounting
for Derivatives and Hedging Activities," as amended, and changed the method of
accounting for derivative instruments. Derivatives are now reflected on the
Condensed Balance Sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair market
value, and the changes in the fair value are currently recognized in earnings
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. An additional interpretation
of Statement No. 133 may result in a change -- effective on April 1, 2002 -- in
accounting for certain contracts related to fuel supplies that contain quantity
options. If these contracts are derivatives, they will be marked to market.
However, due to the existence of specific cost-based fuel recovery clauses for
SAVANNAH, this change is not expected to have a material impact on net income.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset Retirement
Obligations," which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with retiring assets. The liability for an asset's future
retirement must be recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred.
The cost must be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting
from the passage of time will be recognized as operating expenses. Statement No.
143 must be adopted by January 1, 2003. SAVANNAH is currently assessing the
impact of adopting Statement No. 143 on its financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first three months of
2002 included the addition of approximately $9.6 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See SAVANNAH's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Credit Rating Risk

SAVANNAH does not have any credit agreements that would require material changes
in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

SAVANNAH's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the previous reporting period, December 31,
2001. In addition, SAVANNAH is not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, SAVANNAH has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity.
To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, SAVANNAH
enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity
through the wholesale electricity market. Realized gains and losses are
recognized in the income statements as incurred. At March 31, 2002, exposure
from these activities was not material to SAVANNAH's financial statements. Also,
based on SAVANNAH's overall variable rate long-term debt exposure at March 31,
2002, a near-term 100 basis point change in interest rates would not materially
affect SAVANNAH's financial statements. Fair value of changes in energy trading
contracts and valuations at March 31, 2002 are as follows:

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Financing Activities

SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire higher
cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of SAVANNAH
under "Capital Requirements for Construction", "Other Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of SAVANNAH's capital
requirements for its construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at March 31,
2002 approximately $1.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$65.5 million of committed credit arrangements with banks, of which $45.5
million expires in 2002 and $20 million expires in 2003. The credit arrangements
provide liquidity support to SAVANNAH's obligations with respect to variable
rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper. SAVANNAH may also meet
short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to issue and sell
commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of SAVANNAH and other
SOUTHERN subsidiaries. At March 31, 2002, SAVANNAH had outstanding $32.1 million
of notes payable. Since SAVANNAH has no major generating plants under
construction, management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)   The condensed financial statements of the registrants included herein
      have been prepared by each registrant, without audit,
      pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.  In the opinion of
      each registrant's management, the information regarding
      such registrant furnished herein reflects all adjustments necessary to
      present fairly the results of operations for the periods
      ended March 31, 2002 and 2001.  Certain information and footnote
      disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
      in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
      United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such
      rules and regulations, although each registrant believes that the
      disclosures regarding such registrant are adequate to make the
      information presented not misleading.  It is suggested that these
      condensed financial statements of each registrant be read in
      conjunction with the financial statements of such registrant and the
      notes thereto included in the Form 10-K.  Certain prior
      period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period
      presentation.  Due to seasonal variations in the demand for
      energy, operating results for the periods presented do not necessarily
      indicate operating results for the entire year.

(B)   Reference is made to Note 11 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in
      Item 8 and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Overview of
      Consolidated Earnings and Dividends" of SOUTHERN in Item 7 of the Form
      10-K for information on the spin off of Mirant from SOUTHERN.

      On April 2, 2001, SOUTHERN completed the spin off of Mirant with a tax
      free distribution to SOUTHERN's shareholders of its remaining ownership of
      272 million Mirant shares. Shares from the spin off were distributed at a
      ratio of approximately 0.4 share of Mirant common stock for every share of
      SOUTHERN common stock held at the record date. The distribution resulted
      in charges of approximately $3.2 billion and $0.4 billion to SOUTHERN's
      paid-in capital and retained earnings, respectively.

      As a result of the spin off, SOUTHERN's financial statements reflect
      Mirant as discontinued operations. All historical financial statements
      presented and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to this
      presentation, with the historical assets and liabilities of Mirant
      presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as net assets of
      discontinued operations.

(C)   The operating companies are subject to the provisions of FASB Statement
      No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the
      event that a portion of a company's operations is no longer subject to
      these provisions, the company would be required to write off related
      regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable,
      and determine if any other assets have been impaired. For additional
      information, see Note 1 to the financial statements of each registrant in
      Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN,
      ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for information on EPA litigation. On April 29, 2002, the U. S.
      District Court in Alabama extended the stay of the proceeding in Alabama
      through late July 2002.

(E)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of each registrant
      in Item 8 and to Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of the
      Form 10-K for information relating to various lawsuits.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(F)   SOUTHERN has made separate guarantees to certain counterparties regarding
      performance of contractual commitments by Mirant's trading and marketing
      subsidiaries. At March 31, 2002, the total notional amount of guarantees
      was $52.5 million and the estimated fair value of net contractual
      commitments outstanding was approximately $29.2 million. SOUTHERN's
      potential exposure under these contractual commitments is not expected to
      materially differ from the estimated fair value. Subsequent to the spin
      off, Mirant began paying SOUTHERN a monthly fee of 1% on the average
      aggregate maximum principal amount of all guarantees outstanding until
      they are replaced or expire. Mirant must use reasonable efforts to release
      SOUTHERN from all such support arrangements and will indemnify SOUTHERN
      for any obligations incurred.

      Reference is made to Note 9 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN under
      the caption "Guarantees" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(G)   Reference is made to Item 1 - Business - "Rate Proceedings" and Note 3 to
      the financial statements of SOUTHERN and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for information relating to retail rate adjustment procedures. On
      March 5, 2002, the Alabama PSC approved a revision to ALABAMA's rates that
      provide for periodic adjustments based upon ALABAMA's earned return on
      end-of-period retail common equity. This revision provides for an annual,
      rather than quarterly, adjustment and imposes a 3 percent limit on any
      such annual adjustment. The return on common equity range of 13.0 to 14.5
      percent remains unchanged. In April 2002, retail rates were increased by
      2% in accordance with the Rate Stabilization and Equalization Plan. The
      Alabama PSC also accepted ALABAMA's proposal to lower the energy cost
      recovery factor for the billing months April 2002 through December 2002.

(H)   On December 20, 2001, the Georgia PSC approved a new three-year retail
      rate order for GEORGIA ending December 31, 2004.  Under the terms of
      the order, earnings will be evaluated annually against a retail return
      on common equity range of 10 percent to 12.95 percent. Two-thirds of
      any earnings above the 12.95 percent return will be applied to rate
      refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by GEORGIA.  Retail rates
      were decreased by $118 million effective January 1, 2002.  Pursuant to a
      previous three-year accounting order, GEORGIA recorded $332 million of
      accelerated cost amortization and interest thereon which has been
      credited to a regulatory liability account as mandated by the Georgia PSC.
      Under the new rate order, the accelerated amortization and the interest
      will be amortized equally over three years as a credit to expense
      beginning in January 2002.  Effective January 1, 2002, GEORGIA
      discontinued recording accelerated depreciation and amortization.
      GEORGIA will not file for a general base rate increase unless its
      projected retail return on common equity falls below 10 percent.
      GEORGIA is required to file a general rate case on July 1, 2004, in
      response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether
      the rate order should be continued, modified or discontinued.  See Note 3
      to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K under
      "Retail Rate Orders" for additional information.

(I)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
      designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
      Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
      environmental contingencies.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(J)   On September 10, 2001, GULF filed a request with the Florida PSC for a
      base rate increase of $69.9 million. This increase is necessary to cover
      costs related to GULF's new combined cycle facility, Smith Unit 3,
      increases in operation and maintenance expenses and capital additions. In
      its brief filed with the Florida PSC, GULF reduced its request to $64.9
      million, primarily to reflect lower financing costs related to Smith 3 and
      a 25-year depreciable life for Smith Unit 3 (rather than the 20-year life
      as originally filed). On April 26, 2002, the Florida PSC voted to grant
      GULF a $53.2 million, or 8.9%, annual increase, which reflects an
      authorized return on equity of 12.00%. The new rates resulting from the
      revenue increase were approved by the Florida PSC on May 8, 2002 and
      become effective on June 7, 2002.

(K)   In August 2001, MISSISSIPPI filed a request with the Mississippi PSC to
      increase annual retail rate revenues by approximately $46.4 million.
      In order to consider MISSISSIPPI's request, the Mississippi PSC suspended
      the semi-annual evaluations under PEP.  In December 2001, the Mississippi
      PSC approved an increase of approximately $39 million, which took
      effect in January 2002.  Additionally, the Mississippi PSC ordered
      MISSISSIPPI to reactivate the semi-annual evaluations under
      PEP, beginning with the 12-month period ending December 31, 2000.  PEP
      will remain in effect until the Mississippi PSC modifies,   suspends or
      terminates the plan.  On April 30, 2002, the Mississippi PSC held and
      concluded hearings on a review of the return on equity models used in
      PEP in setting MISSISSIPPI's authorized return on equity.  This
      proceeding will conclude in 2002, so that changes to the PEP return on
      equity models, if any may be incorporated into the PEP evaluation filing
      for the period ending December 31, 2002.  The outcome of this matter and
      any future impact to MISSISSIPPI cannot now be determined.

(L)  Reference  is made to  Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  -
     "Future  Earnings  Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K regarding the
     settlement agreement between MISSISSIPPI and certain wholesale customers to
     increase its wholesale  tariff rates effective June 1, 2002. In March 2002,
     that agreement was filed with the FERC for approval. On April 19, 2002, the
     FERC accepted for filing the settlement agreement and placed the new tariff
     rates in effect  June 1,  2002  without  modifying  the  agreement  reached
     between MISSISSIPPI and its customers.  The settlement agreement results in
     annual  increase of  approximately  $10.5  million  and the  adoption of an
     Energy Cost Management  clause similar to the one approved by MISSISSIPPI's
     retail  jurisdiction.  Reference  is  made  to  Note  1  to  the  financial
     statements  of  MISSISSIPPI  in  Item  8  of  the  Form  10-K  for  further
     information on the Energy Cost Management clause.  MISSISSIPPI's order from
     the FERC constitutes final agency action on this matter, absent a rehearing
     request that has to be filed within 30 days of the date of the order (April
     19, 2002). No party opposed the filing, and MISSISSIPPI does not expect any
     parties to file for rehearing.

(M)  SAVANNAH  filed a base rate case on November 30, 2001.  The primary  reason
     for this base rate case is to recover significant new revenue  requirements
     related to a 200 MW Plant Wansley  Purchase Power Agreement  beginning June
     2002, as well as other  operation and  maintenance  changes.  The requested
     increase  is  $24.4  million  or 7.6% of  total  revenues.  In the  filing,
     SAVANNAH announced that it would file for a simultaneous fuel cost recovery
     decrease  to offset  most,  if not all,  the base rate  increase.  A public
     hearing in which SAVANNAH presented direct testimony to the Georgia PSC was
     held in  Savannah  on  February 6 and  February  7, 2002.  Intervenors  and
     Adversary  Staff  presented their case at a public hearing in Atlanta March
     27 and March 28, 2002.  SAVANNAH filed written rebuttal testimony April 12,
     2002 and presented oral rebuttal  testimony in a hearing on April 24, 2002.
     A  decision  on both the fuel and base rates will be made at the end of May
     to be effective  with the first billing cycle in June 2002.  The outcome of
     this matter and any future impact on SAVANNAH cannot now be determined.
