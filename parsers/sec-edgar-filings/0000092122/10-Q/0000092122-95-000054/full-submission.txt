                            THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                       MANAGEMENT'S OPINION AS TO FAIR STATEMENT OF RESULTS

     The condensed financial statements of SOUTHERN included herein have been
prepared by SOUTHERN, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the SEC. In the opinion of SOUTHERN's management, subject to the effect of such
adjustments, if any, as might have been required had the outcome of the
uncertainty with respect to the actions of the regulators regarding the
recoverability of GEORGIA's investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped storage
hydroelectric project as more fully discussed in Note (F) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein, been known, the information furnished herein
reflects all adjustments (which, except for the provision for separation
benefits, included only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present
fairly the results for the periods ended March 31, 1995 and 1994. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although SOUTHERN
believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in
SOUTHERN's latest annual report on Form 10-K.

                           THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                         MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                             OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations

Earnings
SOUTHERN's earnings for the first three months of 1995 were higher than earnings
recorded in the same period of 1994 primarily because of costs recorded in the
prior period associated with workforce reduction programs for GEORGIA and the
system service company, SCS. Consolidated net income was $206 million for the
first quarter of 1995, compared to $142 million for the first quarter of 1994.
Earnings per share were $0.31 in the first quarter of 1995, compared to $0.22 in
the corresponding period of 1994. Disregarding the after-tax effect of the
workforce reduction programs of $57 million ($0.09 per share), earnings would
have risen slightly above 1994's results.

Revenues
Despite the adverse effects of weather, retail energy sales rose 2.2% primarily
because of the improvement in the economy. Energy sales to residential,
commercial and industrial customers increased (decreased) (0.4%), 2.3% and 4.1%,
respectively. Wholesale energy sales decreased due to reduced demand and
scheduled reductions in off-system contracts. Capacity revenues for the first
quarter of 1995 were $14 million less than in the first quarter of 1994
primarily because GEORGIA completed the third sale of a portion of Plant Scherer
Unit 4 in June 1994. The final sale in a series of four transactions for the
sale of this generating unit is scheduled for June 1995. The generation from
this unit has been dedicated to unit power sales.

Expenses
Fuel expense for the first three months of 1995, compared to the corresponding
period of 1994, decreased due primarily to the displacement of fossil and
nuclear generation with hydro generation and the lower average cost of fuel
consumed. Purchased power expense decreased because of the reduction in capacity
buyback payments by GEORGIA to the co-owners of Plant Vogtle. See Note (E) to
the Condensed Financial Statements herein for information regarding the Georgia
PSC's retail rate order that required the levelization of capacity buyback
expense for Plant Vogtle.

     Other operation expense in the first quarter of 1994 included approximately
$93 million for costs associated with workforce reduction programs. Maintenance
expenses decreased due to the timing of scheduled maintenance on generating
units. The increase in depreciation and amortization is attributable to
increased investment in plant. Income tax expense in the first quarter of 1994
reflects the effect of the workforce reduction programs.

Interest Charges and Dividends on Preferred Stock
The decrease in interest on long-term debt reflects the SOUTHERN system's
efforts to decrease its capital costs. However, since January 1994, interest
rates have risen and SOUTHERN's subsidiaries have outstanding a number of
securities with interest or dividend rates that vary according to prevailing
market conditions. Interest on interim obligations rose because of higher
interest rates on an increased average amount of short-term debt outstanding.

                             OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations  (Continued)

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under construction
and not included in rate base. The equity portion represents non-cash income.
However, when facilities are completed and included in rate base, previously
capitalized amounts significantly increase cash flow because revenues are higher
as a result of the increased rate base and additional depreciation expense.

Future Earnings Potential
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings is contingent upon
numerous factors ranging from growth in energy sales to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     Reference is made to the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for further discussion of various uncertainties and legal proceedings related
to: the actions of regulators regarding the recovery of GEORGIA's investment in
the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project; a civil suit filed
against ALABAMA related to financing agreements; a tax issue regarding GEORGIA's
tax accounting for the sale in 1984 of an interest in Plant Vogtle and related
capacity and energy buyback commitments; proceedings regarding GEORGIA's
recovery of demand-side conservation program costs; and the outcome of
proceedings initiated by the FERC to determine the appropriate return on equity
on wholesale power and transmission contracts.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
increased costs cannot be offset. The Clean Air Act is discussed under
"Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
SOUTHERN's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors. Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, and the rate of economic growth in SOUTHERN's service area. The
enactment of the Energy Act is beginning to have a dramatic effect on the
electric utility industry. A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy
Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SOUTHERN's 1994
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition,
measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating
stations in financial statements. Further discussion of this issue is found in
"Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 -Management's Discussion and Analysis in
SOUTHERN's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 of
SOUTHERN's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on certain
environmental contingencies.

                            OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations  (Continued)

     SOUTHERN's operating subsidiaries are subject to the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In
the event that a portion of the company's operations is no longer subject to
these provisions, SOUTHERN would be required to write-off related regulatory
assets and liabilities. See Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of
SOUTHERN's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This
statement imposes stricter criteria for regulatory assets by requiring that such
assets be probable of future recovery at each balance sheet date. SOUTHERN
anticipates adopting this standard on January 1, 1996 and does not expect that
adoption will have a material impact on the financial position or results of
operations of SOUTHERN based on the current regulatory structure in which
SOUTHERN operates. This conclusion may change in the future as competitive
factors influence wholesale and retail pricing in this industry.

Financial Condition

Overview
The major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first three
months of 1995 were the addition of approximately $313 million to utility plant
and the sale by SOUTHERN of additional shares of its common stock for $180
million. The funds for gross property additions and other capital requirements
were derived primarily from operations and the sale of common stock by SOUTHERN.
See SOUTHERN's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Capital Structure
One of SOUTHERN's goals is to maintain common equity as a percent of total
capitalization, including short-term debt and the current portion of
capitalization, within a range of 40 to 45%. This ratio was 45.3% at March 31,
1995, compared to 44.4% at December 31, 1994. The market price of SOUTHERN's
common stock at March 31, 1995, was $20.375 per share, compared to a book value
of $12.58. This represents a market-to-book value ratio of 162%. The dividend
for the first quarter of 1995 was 30.5 cents per share.

Capital Requirements for Construction
The construction program of the Southern electric system is budgeted at $4.0
billion for the three years 1995 through 1997 ($1.4 billion in 1995, $1.3
billion in 1996 and $1.3 billion in 1997). Actual construction costs may vary
from this estimate because of such factors as changes in business conditions;
changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulations; changes in environmental
regulations; revised load growth projections; increasing costs of labor,
equipment and materials; and the cost of capital.

                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                             OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Financial Condition  (Continued)

     Current energy demand forecasts do not require any additional baseload
generating facilities until well into the future. However, within the service
area, the construction of combustion turbine peaking units of approximately
1,100 megawatts is planned to be completed by 1997. In addition, significant
construction will continue related to transmission and distribution facilities
and the upgrading and extension of the useful lives of generating plants.
GEORGIA and OPC have entered into a joint ownership agreement for the latter to
assume responsibility for the construction and completion of the Rocky Mountain
project. This agreement is described further in Note 4 to the financial
statements in Item 8 of SOUTHERN's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Also, see
Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8 in SOUTHERN's 1994 Annual Report on
Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's joint ownership agreement for a
combustion turbine unit in Florida.

     Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the
Southern electric system's capital requirements and operating costs. The acid
rain compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will have a significant impact on
the Southern electric system. This legislation, as well as other legislation and
regulations, are described under "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 -
Management's Discussion and Analysis in SOUTHERN's 1994 Annual Report on Form
10-K. The full impact of these requirements cannot be determined at this time,
pending the development and implementation of applicable regulations.

Other Capital Requirements
In addition to the funds needed for the construction program, approximately $555
million will be required by March 31, 1996, for present sinking fund
requirements and maturities of long-term debt. Also, the operating subsidiaries
plan to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire high-cost debt and
preferred stock and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Funds
In addition to the sale of common stock in the first quarter of 1995, SOUTHERN
may require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The
amounts and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 1995, as well as
in subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities.
The operating subsidiaries plan to obtain the funds required for construction
and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. However, the
type and timing of financings will depend on market conditions, maintenance of
adequate earnings, and regulatory approval. Additionally, GEORGIA expects to
receive approximately $131 million in June 1995 from the sale of its remaining
ownership interest in Plant Scherer Unit 4. This property sale is discussed
further in Note 7 to the financial statements in Item 8 in SOUTHERN's 1994
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
March 31, 1995, approximately $113 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $1.4 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks.

                             OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Financial Condition  (Continued)

     At March 31, 1995, the system companies had outstanding $372 million of
notes payable and $510 million of commercial paper. The short-term lines of
credit may not be utilized in their entirety without additional regulatory
approval. Since the construction program with respect to major generating
projects has been completed, management believes that the need for working
capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining
large cash balances.

     In order to issue additional long-term debt and preferred stock, the
operating subsidiaries must comply with certain earnings coverage requirements
outlined in their respective mortgage indentures and corporate charters. The
coverage ratios of SOUTHERN's operating subsidiaries are sufficiently high to
permit, at present interest rate levels, any foreseeable security sales. The
amount of securities which they will be permitted to issue in the future will
depend upon market conditions and other factors prevailing at that time.

                                      ALABAMA POWER COMPANY
                             MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations

ALABAMA's financial performance during the first quarter of 1995 decreased,
compared to the same period of 1994, due primarily to lower capacity revenues
and higher financing costs. Net income after dividends on preferred stock was
$65.3 million during the first three months of 1995, compared to $72.0 million
in the corresponding period of 1994.

Revenues
Operating revenues in the first three months of 1995 decreased from the
corresponding period of 1994 due primarily to lower fuel clause revenues and
fewer energy sales to non-affiliated customers. Retail energy sales rose 2.8%
due primarily to an increase in customers served and the improving economy in
Alabama. Weather had a very small negative impact on energy sales in 1995 and a
modestly positive effect in 1994. Also, some reduction in non-affiliated
revenues occurred due to a small decrease in capacity payments received from
these customers. Total energy sales decreased 2.4%.

     Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period
depending on demand, the availability, and the variable production cost of
generating resources at each company.

Expenses
Fuel expense decreased because of the lower average cost of fuel consumed and
the displacement of fossil and nuclear generation with hydro generation. Total
generation increased marginally. Purchased power from both affiliates and
non-affiliates decreased because of lower demand. Maintenance expenses for the
first quarter of 1995 were lower than the same period of 1994 due primarily to
decreased maintenance on transmission and distribution plant. The increase in
depreciation and amortization reflects additions to utility plant. The decrease
in income tax expense is attributable to the change in earnings.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are
necessary to finance the construction of new facilities. While cash is not
realized currently from such allowance, it is realized over the service life of
the plant through increased revenues resulting from a higher rate base and
higher depreciation expense. The amount of AFUDC recorded will rise as ALABAMA's
investment in the construction of combustion turbine peaking units approach
commercial operation.

Interest Charges and Dividends on Preferred Stock
The increase in interest on long-term debt reflects the sale of additional first
mortgage bonds. Preferred stock dividends increased due to higher dividend rates
on three series of variable rate preferred stock. Interest on interim
obligations rose due to higher interest rates on an increased average amount of
short-term debt outstanding.

                              OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations  (Continued)

Future Earnings Potential
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from growth in energy sales to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     Discussed in the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein are
certain regulatory and legal proceedings that may impact ALABAMA's future
earnings. The issues include a civil suit related to financing agreements and
proceedings concerning the reasonableness of the Southern electric system's
wholesale rate schedules and contracts.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
cost increases cannot be offset. The Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues are discussed under "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's
Discussion and Analysis in ALABAMA's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Future earnings will also depend upon growth in electric sales which are
subject to a number of factors. Traditionally, these factors have included
changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced
by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather, competition, and the rate of
economic growth in ALABAMA's service area. However, the enactment of the Energy
Act is beginning to have a dramatic effect on the future of the electric utility
industry. A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy Act and
particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in ALABAMA's 1994
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     The staff of the SEC has questioned certain current accounting practices of
the electric utility industry regarding the recognition, measurement and
classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating stations in
financial statements. Further discussion of this issue is found under "Future
Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
ALABAMA's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     ALABAMA is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a portion of
the company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, ALABAMA would
be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1
to the financial statements in Item 8 in ALABAMA's 1994 Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information.

      In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This
statement imposes stricter criteria for regulatory assets by requiring that such
assets be probable of future recovery at each balance sheet

date. ALABAMA anticipates adopting this standard on January 1, 1996 and does not
expect that adoption will have a material impact on the financial position or
results of operations of ALABAMA based on the current regulatory structure in
which ALABAMA operates. This conclusion may change in the future as competitive
factors influence wholesale and retail pricing in this industry.

Financial Condition

Overview
The principal change in ALABAMA's financial condition in the first three months
of 1995 was gross property additions of $126.8 million to utility plant. The
funds for gross property additions were derived from operating activities and an
increase in short-term debt. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
herein for further details. ALABAMA's common equity as a percent of total
capitalization was 47.9% at March 31, 1995, compared to 47.4% at year-end 1994.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
ALABAMA has committed lines of credit and regulatory approval for short-term
borrowings of up to $530 million. At March 31, 1995, ALABAMA had outstanding
$288 million of commercial paper and $12 million of notes payable.

     Capital expenditures are estimated to total $1.6 billion for the three
years 1995 through 1997 ($604 million in 1995, $500 million in 1996 and $502
million in 1997). Current energy demand forecasts do not require any additional
baseload generating facilities until well into the future. However, the
construction of combustion turbine peaking units of approximately 720 megawatts
of capacity is planned by 1996 to meet increased peak-hour demands. Five of the
nine units (80 megawatts of capacity each) are scheduled to begin commercial
operation in May 1995. In addition, significant construction of transmission and
distribution facilities and upgrading of generating plants will continue.

     The capital budget is subject to periodic review and revision and capital
costs incurred may vary from estimates because of several factors, including
changes in business conditions; revised load growth projections; changes in
environmental regulations; changes in existing nuclear plant to meet new
regulatory requirements; increasing costs of labor, equipment and materials; and
the cost of capital.

     In addition to the funds needed for the capital budget, approximately $60.8
million will be required by March 31, 1996, for debt maturities. Also, ALABAMA
will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these
obligations with lower-cost capital, as market conditions permit.

Financial Condition  (Continued)

     It is anticipated that the funds required will be derived from sources
similar to those used in the past. In order to issue additional first mortgage
bonds and preferred stock, ALABAMA must comply with certain earnings coverage
requirements contained in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter.
ALABAMA's coverages are at a level that would permit any necessary amount of
security sales at current interest and dividend rates.

                              REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of March 31, 1995, and the related condensed statements of income for
the three-month periods ended March 31, 1995 and 1994, and condensed statements
of cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 1995 and 1994. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1994
(not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 15, 1995, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1994 is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                       MANAGEMENT'S OPINION AS TO FAIR STATEMENT OF RESULTS


     The condensed financial statements of GEORGIA included herein have been
prepared by GEORGIA, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
SEC. As more fully discussed in Note (F) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein, an uncertainty exists with respect to the actions of the regulators
regarding the recoverability of GEORGIA's investment in the Rocky Mountain
pumped storage hydroelectric project. In the opinion of GEORGIA's management,
subject to the effect of such adjustments, if any, as might have been required
had the outcome of the uncertainty been known, the information regarding GEORGIA
furnished herein reflects all adjustments (which, except for the provision for
separation benefits recorded in 1995 and 1994, included only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results for the periods ended March
31, 1995 and 1994. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and
regulations, although GEORGIA believes that the disclosures regarding GEORGIA
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. It is suggested
that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and the notes thereto included in GEORGIA's latest annual
report on Form 10-K.

                              REVIEW BY INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

     The condensed financial statements of GEORGIA included herein have been
reviewed by GEORGIA's independent public accountants as set forth in their
report included herein as Exhibit 1.

                           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations

Earnings
GEORGIA's earnings for the first quarter of 1995 increased compared to the
corresponding quarter of 1994, primarily as a result of charges in 1994 related
to workforce reduction programs at GEORGIA and the system service company, SCS.
Net income after dividends on preferred stock was $116.1 million in the first
quarter of 1995 and $57.6 million in the first quarter of 1994. Disregarding the
after-tax effect of the provision for separation benefits, GEORGIA's earnings
still would have been slightly above earnings in the first quarter of 1994,
primarily due to lower interest charges and higher retail energy sales.

Revenues
Total operating revenues decreased compared to the first quarter of 1994
primarily because of the decrease in energy sales to non-affiliated wholesale
customers. Excluding fuel clause revenues, which represent the pass-through of
fuel expenses and do not affect income, operating revenues for the first quarter
of 1995 increased $7.9 million, compared to the corresponding period of 1994.

     Retail - Retail energy sales increased 2.6% primarily because of an
increase in customers served and continued improvement in Georgia's economy.
Residential, commercial and industrial energy sales increased 0.4%, 2.6% and
4.1%, respectively. Mild temperatures in the first quarter of 1995 had a
dampening effect on energy sales increases. Total non-fuel retail revenues
increased $15.9 million. Of this amount, $7.6 million is attributable to
increased revenues from demand-side option programs collected through rate
riders reinstated in December 1994. Revenues from demand-side programs generally
represent the direct recovery of program costs. See Note (G) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for additional information on these programs.

     Wholesale - Energy sales to non-affiliated wholesale customers for the
first quarter of 1995 decreased 33.2%, compared to the corresponding period of
1994. Capacity revenues from non-affiliated utilities outside the service area
were down $9.3 million. These capacity revenues decreased as scheduled,
coinciding with GEORGIA completing the third in a series of four transactions
for the sale of Plant Scherer Unit 4 in June 1994. The final sale of this unit
is scheduled for June 1995. Energy revenues from non-affiliated utilities
outside the service area decreased $25.1 million. The energy component of
contract sales is priced at approximately the variable production cost and does
not materially affect earnings.

     Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

                       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations  (Continued)

Operating Expenses
Fuel and Purchased Power - Fuel expense decreased because of less generation and
the displacement of coal-fired generation with hydro generation. Purchased power
expense for the first quarter of 1995 decreased primarily due to lower energy
purchases from non-affiliated companies and scheduled reductions in capacity
buyback payments to the co-owners of Plant Vogtle. See Note (E) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for information regarding the levelization of
capacity buyback expense for Plant Vogtle.

     Other - As part of the SOUTHERN system's effort to curtail growth in
operating expenses, both GEORGIA and SCS initiated workforce reduction programs
in the first quarter of 1994. GEORGIA's portion of SCS's costs for such programs
amounted to approximately $12.1 million, while GEORGIA's programs amounted to
approximately $72.6 million in the first quarter of 1994. Other operation
expense for the first quarter of 1995 increased primarily due to costs
associated with demand-side option programs, and environmental remediation costs
at various sites of $3.7 million in 1995, compared to $0.5 million in 1994. The
demand-side option program costs were offset by increases in retail revenues.
The decrease in maintenance expense is attributable to the timing of
maintenance, primarily on coal-fired generating units. Income taxes in the first
quarter of 1994 reflect the effect of the workforce reduction programs.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under construction
and is included in rate base. The equity portion of AFUDC represents non-cash
income. The increase in AFUDC during the first quarter of 1995 is primarily the
result of higher short-term borrowing rates. Based upon GEORGIA's construction
budget, AFUDC is estimated to total $27 million in 1995 and $17 million in 1996.

Interest Charges and Dividends on Preferred Stock
Interest charges have declined due to refinancing efforts over the past twelve
months. Also, GEORGIA used the proceeds from the Plant Scherer sale to redeem
high cost securities. Dividends on preferred stock have increased because
GEORGIA has a number of securities outstanding that have variable dividend
rates, which have risen since year-end 1993. Interest on interim obligations
rose due to higher interest rates.

Future Earnings Potential
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings. The level of future earnings depends on numerous factors
including energy sales and regulatory matters.

                          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations  (Continued)

     Growth in energy sales is subject to a number of factors which
traditionally have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities,
energy conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, and the rate of economic growth in GEORGIA's service area. The
enactment of the Energy Act is having a dramatic effect on the future of the
electric utility industry. A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy
Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in GEORGIA's 1994
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     The scheduled addition of four combustion turbine generating units and the
Rocky Mountain hydroelectric project in 1995 and one jointly-owned combustion
turbine unit in 1996, will increase related operation, maintenance and
depreciation expense.

     GEORGIA has entered into a four-year purchase power agreement to meet
peaking needs. Beginning in 1996, GEORGIA will purchase 400 megawatts of
capacity. In 1998, this amount will decline to 200 megawatts for the remaining
two years. Capacity payments are projected to be $6 million in 1996 and 1997 and
$3 million in 1998 and 1999. GEORGIA has also reached an agreement on major
terms and conditions of a purchase power arrangement whereby GEORGIA would buy
electricity during peak periods from a proposed 200 megawatt cogeneration
facility, starting in June 1998. A final agreement is expected to be completed
and filed with the Georgia PSC for certification during 1995.

     GEORGIA is scheduled to sell in June 1995 its remaining ownership interest
(16.55%) in Plant Scherer Unit 4 to two Florida utilities. This transaction will
generate approximately $131 million in cash, including an estimated after-tax
gain of approximately $12 million. This transaction coincides with scheduled
reductions in capacity revenues from Florida utilities under unit power sales
contracts of approximately $18 million in 1995 and an additional $10 million in
1996.

     As discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item 8 of
the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report in Form 10-K, regulatory
uncertainties exist related to the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric
project. In the event the Georgia PSC does not allow full recovery of the
project's costs, then the portion not allowed may have to be written off.
GEORGIA's total investment in the project at completion is estimated to be
approximately $200 million.

     Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item
8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for
information regarding proceedings with respect to GEORGIA's recovery of
demand-side conservation program costs and litigation currently pending in the
U. S. Tax Court. Also discussed therein are the joint complaints filed by OPC

and MEAG in two separate venues seeking to recover from GEORGIA approximately
$16.5 million in alleged partial requirements rates overcharges, plus
approximately $6.3 million in interest.

     The FERC regulates wholesale rate schedules and power sales contacts that
GEORGIA has with its sales for resale customers. The FERC currently is reviewing
the rate of return on common equity included in these schedules and contracts
and may require such returns to be lowered, possibly retroactively. See Note 3
to the financial statements in Item 8 in GEORGIA's 1994 Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information.

     The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition,
measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating
stations in financial statements. Further discussion of this issue is found in
"Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 -Management's Discussion and Analysis in
GEORGIA's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Note 4 to the financial statements in Item 8 of
GEORGIA's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on certain
environmental contingencies.

     GEORGIA is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a portion of
the company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, GEORGIA would
be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1
to the financial statements in Item 8 of GEORGIA's 1994 Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information.

     In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This
statement imposes stricter criteria for regulatory assets by requiring that such
assets be probable of future recovery at each balance sheet date. GEORGIA
anticipates adopting this standard on January 1, 1996 and does not expect that
adoption will have a material impact on the financial position or results of
operations of GEORGIA based on the current regulatory structure in which GEORGIA
operates. This conclusion may change in the future as competitive factors
influence wholesale and retail pricing in this industry.

Financial Condition

Overview
The principal changes in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first three
months of 1995 were additions of $103 million to utility plant. The funds needed

for gross property additions are currently provided from operations. See
GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Construction and Other Capital Requirements
Estimated construction expenditures for the years 1995 through 1997 are $579
million, $626 million and $724 million, respectively. GEORGIA's management has
adopted an initiative to reduce its 1996 and 1997 construction expenditures by
approximately 10% from currently estimated amounts. There can be no assurance
that such reductions will be achieved.

     The Clean Air Act will have a significant impact on the capital
requirements of the Southern electric system. This legislation, as well as other
legislation and regulations, is described under "Environmental Issues" in Item 7
- - Management's Discussion and Analysis in GEORGIA's 1994 Annual Report on Form
10-K.

     Cash requirements for long-term debt maturities and redemptions total
approximately $417.4 million for the twelve months ending March 31, 1996.
Included in this amount is the redemption of $100 million of first mortgage
bonds funded by an increase in commercial paper.

Sources of Funds
GEORGIA expects to meet future capital requirements primarily using funds from
operations and, if needed, by the issuance of new debt and equity securities,
term loans and short-term borrowings. Cash from operations for the first three
months of 1995 increased, as compared to the corresponding period in 1994,
primarily because of a decrease in income tax and interest payments.

     GEORGIA must comply with coverage requirements of its mortgage indenture
and corporate charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.
GEORGIA's ability to satisfy all coverage requirements is such that it could
issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock to provide sufficient funds
for all anticipated requirements.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had approximately
$541 million of unused credit arrangements with banks at March 31, 1995.
Additionally, the completion of the remaining transaction for the sale of Plant
Scherer Unit 4 in June 1995 will generate approximately $131 million.

                          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of March 31, 1995, and the related condensed
statements of income for the three-month periods ended March 31, 1995 and 1994,
and the condensed statements of cash flows for the three-month periods ended
March 31, 1995 and 1994. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     As more fully discussed in Note (F) to the Condensed Financial Statements,
an uncertainty exists with respect to the actions of the regulators regarding
the recoverability of the Company's investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped
storage hydroelectric project. The outcome of this uncertainty cannot presently
be determined. Accordingly, no provision for any writedown of the costs
associated with the Rocky Mountain facility resulting from the potential actions
of the Georgia Public Service Commission has been made in the accompanying
Condensed Financial Statements.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1994
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 15, 1995, we included
an explanatory paragraph which describes an uncertainty with respect to the
actions of the regulators regarding the recoverability of the Company's
investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project. In our
opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet
as of December 31, 1994, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation
to the balance sheet from which it has been derived.

                        MANAGEMENT'S OPINION AS TO FAIR STATEMENT OF RESULTS

     The condensed financial statements of GULF included herein have been
prepared by GULF, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
SEC. In the opinion of GULF's management, the information regarding GULF
furnished herein reflects all adjustments (which included only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results for the periods ended March
31, 1995 and 1994. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations, although GULF believes that the disclosures regarding GULF are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading. It is suggested that
these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and the notes thereto included in GULF's latest annual report on Form
10-K.

                                  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                               RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations

Earnings
GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first three months
of 1995 was $10.9 million, compared to $10.1 million for the same period of
1994. The rise in earnings was primarily due to decreased non-fuel operation
expenses as discussed below.

Revenues
Retail energy sales for the first quarter of 1995 decreased 0.5% from the
corresponding period of 1994 due primarily to the mild temperatures experienced
in the winter of 1995. However, retail revenues increased because of higher
regulatory cost recovery clause revenues. The regulatory clause recovery
provisions equal the related expenses and have no material effect on net income.
Wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates also decreased with capacity revenues
$1.3 million lower than in the first quarter of 1994. Also, included in
operating revenues for the first quarter of 1995 is $1.4 million collected to
recover county franchise fees. These collections are also included in taxes
other than income taxes and have no impact on earnings (see discussion under
"Expenses"). Including energy sales to affiliated companies, total energy sales
increased 1.8%.

Expenses
Fuel expenses for the first quarter of 1995 increased over the same period of
1994 due to an increase in generation. Purchased power transactions (both sales
and purchases) among the affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system will vary from period to period depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generating resources at each company. Other operation expenses for
the first quarter of 1995, compared to the first quarter of last year, were
lower due primarily to a reduction in costs associated with a coal supply
suspension agreement, which was essentially fully amortized by year-end 1994.
See Note 5 to the financial statements in Item 8 in GULF's 1994 Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information. Maintenance expenses decreased due
primarily to the scheduling of maintenance on production facilities. The
decrease in depreciation and amortization is attributable to the amortization of
limited-term property, which was fully amortized by December 1994. The increase
in taxes other than income taxes is attributable to $1.4 million of county
franchise fees in the first three months of 1995 as discussed above.

Interest Charges and Dividends on Preferred Stock
The decrease in interest on long-term debt reflects GULF's efforts to decrease
its capital costs through refinancings of higher-cost issues. The increase in
dividends on preferred stock is due to an increase in the dividend rate on
GULF's adjustable rate preferred stock, reflecting higher interest rates
prevailing since year-end 1993. Interest on notes payable rose because of higher
interest rates on an increased average outstanding amount of notes payable. To
the extent it is economically feasible, GULF will continue its efforts to lower
its capital costs.

Results of Operations  (Continued)

Future Earnings Potential
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on a number of
factors ranging from growth in energy sales to the effects of a less regulated,
more competitive environment.

     Future earnings in the near term will depend upon growth in energy sales,
which is subject to a number of factors. Traditionally, these factors have
included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation
practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather, competition, and the
rate of economic growth in GULF's service area. The enactment of the Energy Act
is beginning to have a dramatic effect on the future of the electric utility
industry. A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy Act and
particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in GULF's 1994
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     See Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 in GULF's 1994 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the hearings ordered by the FERC
regarding the reasonableness of the return on common equity on certain of the
Southern electric system's wholesale rate schedules and contracts.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could reduce earnings if such
increased costs are not fully recovered. The Clean Air Act is discussed further
under "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis
in GULF's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See also Note 3 to the financial
statements in Item 8 in GULF's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion
of the Environmental Cost Recovery clause which provides for the recovery of
such costs.

     GULF is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting for
the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a portion of the
company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, GULF would be
required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1 to
the financial statements in Item 8 in GULF's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for
additional information.

     In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This statement imposes
stricter criteria for regulatory assets by requiring that such assets be
probable of future recovery at each balance sheet date. GULF anticipates
adopting this standard by January 1, 1996 and does not expect that adoption will
have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of
GULF based on the current regulatory structure in which GULF operates. This
conclusion may change in the future as competitive factors influence wholesale
and retail pricing in this industry.

                                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                            RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Financial Condition

Overview
The major change in GULF's financial condition during the first three months of
1995 was gross property additions of $14.8 million. The principal sources of
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were provided from
operations. See the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Capital Requirements for Construction
GULF's gross property additions, including those amounts related to
environmental compliance, are estimated to total approximately $225 million for
the three years 1995 through 1997 ($62 million in 1995, $79 million in 1996 and
$84 million in 1997). The estimates of property additions for the three-year
period include $13 million committed to meeting the requirements of the Clean
Air Act, the cost of which is expected to be recovered through the Environmental
Cost Recovery clause. Actual construction costs may vary from these estimates
because of factors such as the granting of timely and adequate rate increases,
changes in environmental regulations, revised load projections, the cost and
efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials, and the cost of
capital. GULF does not have any baseload generating plants under construction,
however, construction related to maintenance and upgrading transmission and
distribution facilities and generating plants will continue.

     Various environmental legislation and other related regulations are
described in "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in GULF's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The full impact of these
requirements cannot be determined at this time, pending the development and
implementation of applicable regulations.

     In addition to the funds required for the construction program, $12.8
million will be required by March 31, 1996, in connection with improvement fund
requirements, maturities and redemptions of long-term debt. GULF plans to
continue a program to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace
these obligations with lower-cost capital as market conditions and terms of the
instruments permit.

     At March 31, 1995, GULF had $37 million of unused credit arrangements with
banks to meet its short-term cash needs. GULF had $47.5 million of short-term
bank borrowings outstanding at March 31, 1995.

     It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be derived
from operations, the sale of additional first mortgage bonds and preferred
stock, and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. GULF is required to meet certain
coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter
to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. GULF's coverage ratios
are sufficient to permit, at present interest rate levels, any foreseeable
security sales. The amount of securities which GULF will be permitted to issue

in the future will depend upon market conditions and other factors prevailing
at that time.

Results of Operations

Net Income
MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first
quarter of 1995 was $9.3 million, compared to $8.3 million for the corresponding
period of 1994. Net income rose primarily because of lower maintenance expenses
and a retail rate increase under the ECO plan.

Revenues
Revenues for the first three months of 1995 decreased, compared to the same
period of 1994, because of decreases of 0.9% in retail energy sales and
approximately 44% in non-affiliated non-territorial wholesale energy sales.
However, revenues were positively impacted by a retail rate increase of $7.6
million annually under the ECO plan effective April 1994. Energy sales to
wholesale customers in MISSISSIPPI's service territory were up a small amount.
Energy sales to commercial customers increased 2.6% reflecting sales to casinos
and service industries supporting casinos in coastal Mississippi. Total energy
sales decreased 2.4%. Non-affiliated wholesale capacity revenues decreased
approximately $0.5 million.

Expenses
Fuel and purchased power expenses combined decreased in the first quarter of
1995, compared to the corresponding period of 1994, due to lower energy sales.
Purchased power transactions (both sales and purchases) among the affiliated
companies within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company.

     Other operation expenses in the first quarter of 1995, compared to the
corresponding period in 1994, increased primarily due to the amortization of
workforce reduction programs and, pursuant to the Clean Air Act, the recognition
of emission allowance expense. Such emission allowances are a recoverable
expense under the ECO plan. The decrease in maintenance expense is attributable
to the timing of scheduled maintenance on production facilities. Taxes other
than income taxes decreased because of lower revenues. The increase in income
tax expense reflects higher earnings.

     The increase in interest was because of the sale or issuance of additional
debt instruments and higher interest rates on $23.3 million of pollution control
bonds that have variable interest rates.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction. The equity portion of AFUDC represents non-cash income. However,
when facilities are completed and included in rate base, previously capitalized
amounts increase cash flow because revenues are higher as a result of the
increased rate base and additional depreciation expense. The amount of AFUDC
recorded in 1994 was higher because of MISSISSIPPI's investment in the
construction of a combustion turbine generating unit. This unit began commercial
operation in May 1994.

Future Earnings Potential
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales to a less
regulated, more competitive environment. Operating revenues will be affected by
any changes in rates under the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a
stabilizing force on electric rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking
place. Also see Notes (B) and (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding FERC's review of equity returns and workforce
reduction programs, respectively.

     MISSISSIPPI's 1995 annual filing under the ECO plan with the Mississippi
PSC resulted in an approved annual revenue requirement, effective in May 1995,
of $3.7 million, including $1.6 million of 1994 carryover.

     Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors. Traditionally, these factors
have included the rate of economic growth in MISSISSIPPI's service area,
customer growth, competition, weather, changes in contracts with neighboring
utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, and the elasticity of
demand. The enactment of the Energy Act is beginning to have a dramatic effect
on the future of the electric utility industry. A discussion of the potential
impact of the Energy Act and particularly its effect on competition is found
under "Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in MISSISSIPPI's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    MISSISSIPPI is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,
Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a
portion of the company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions,
MISSISSIPPI would be required to write off related regulatory assets and
liabilities. See Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 in MISSISSIPPI's
1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

     In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This
statement imposes stricter criteria for regulatory assets by requiring that such
assets be probable of future recovery at each balance sheet date. MISSISSIPPI
anticipates adopting this standard on January 1, 1996 and does not expect that
adoption will have a material impact on the financial position or results of
operations of MISSISSIPPI based on the current regulatory structure in which
MISSISSIPPI operates. This conclusion may change in the future as competitive
factors influence wholesale and retail pricing in this industry.

                              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Financial Condition

Overview
During the first three months of 1995, gross property additions were $16.3
million. The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were
derived primarily from internal sources and an increase in short-term debt. See
the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

     At March 31, 1995, cash totaled approximately $1.2 million and MISSISSIPPI
had $97 million of unused credit arrangements with banks to meet short-term cash
needs. MISSISSIPPI had $22 million of notes payable outstanding at quarter-end.
It is MISSISSIPPI's strategy to maintain a permanent layer of short-term debt,
approximately $40 million through the end of 1995, consistent with its overall
risk capital strategy.

Capital Requirements
MISSISSIPPI's gross property additions for the next three years are estimated to
be $223 million ($78 million in 1995, $73 million in 1996 and $72 million in
1997). The major emphasis within the construction program will be on upgrading
existing facilities. Included in these construction estimates is $2.9 million
committed to meeting the requirements of the Clean Air Act regulations.
Revisions may be necessary because of factors such as revised load projections,
the availability and cost of capital and changes in environmental regulations.

    In addition to the funds required for the construction program,
approximately $58.1 million will be required by March 31, 1996, for maturities
of long-term debt. It is anticipated that the funds required for construction
and other purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be
derived from operations, the sale of additional first mortgage bonds, pollution
control bonds and preferred stock and the receipt of additional capital
contributions from SOUTHERN. MISSISSIPPI is required to meet certain coverage
requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter to issue
new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. MISSISSIPPI's coverage ratios are
sufficiently high to permit, at present interest rate levels, any foreseeable
security sales. The amount of securities which MISSISSIPPI will be able to issue
in the future will depend upon market conditions and other factors prevailing at
that time.

Environmental Matters
Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the Southern
electric system's capital requirements and operating costs. The acid rain
compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will have a significant impact on the
Southern electric system. This legislation, as well as other legislation and
regulations, are described under "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 -
Management's Discussion and Analysis in MISSISSIPPI's 1994 Annual Report on Form
10-K. The full impact of these requirements cannot be determined at this time
pending the development and implementation of applicable regulations.
MISSISSIPPI's management believes that the ECO plan will provide for retail
recovery of the Clean Air Act costs.

Financial Condition  (Continued)

     MISSISSIPPI must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that
cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and
regulations, MISSISSIPPI could incur costs to clean up properties currently or
previously owned. Upon identifying potential sites, the company conducts
studies, when possible, to determine the extent of any required cleanup costs.
Should remediation be determined to be probable, reasonable estimates of costs
to clean up such sites are developed and recognized in the financial statements.
A currently owned site where manufactured gas plant operations were located
prior to MISSISSIPPI's ownership is under investigation for potential
remediation, but no prediction can presently be made regarding the extent, if
any, of contamination or possible cleanup. Results of this investigation are
expected to be available in early 1995. If this site were required to be
remediated, industry studies show MISSISSIPPI could incur cleanup costs ranging
from $1.5 million to $10 million before giving consideration to possible
recovery of clean-up costs from other parties. Accordingly, no accrual has been
made for remediation in the accompanying Condensed Financial Statements.

                                SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations

Earnings
SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first three
months of 1995 was $2.4 million, compared to $3.9 million in the corresponding
period of 1994. The decrease in net income was primarily due to higher operation
and maintenance expenses and lower construction related credits.

Revenues
Although revenues for the first quarter of 1995 were comparable to the
corresponding period in 1994, earnings suffered because of the change in the
composition of energy sales. Retail energy sales increased 1.1%, with the
industrial sector offsetting decreases from residential and commercial
customers. Industrial energy sales were higher primarily because a major
customer performed maintenance on its cogeneration facility in the first quarter
of 1995 and purchased replacement energy under a rate schedule that has a
smaller profit margin than for typical residential and commercial customers.
Wholesale energy sales to non-affiliated companies decreased; however, only the
capacity revenues of such sales have any measurable effect on earnings. Capacity
revenues fell $113,000.

Expenses
Fuel expenses during the first quarter of 1995 decreased, compared to those
recorded in the first quarter of 1994, because generation was lower by
one-third. The change in generation was due to demand in SAVANNAH's service area
and elsewhere in the Southeast. Purchased power transactions among the
affiliated companies within the Southern electric system will vary from period
to period depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources at each company. These transactions do not have a significant impact
on earnings. Other operation expenses for the first three months of 1995
increased over the corresponding period in 1994 for a variety of reasons
including employee compensation and consulting costs for training and increased
expenses related to demand side option programs. The change in maintenance
expense reflects the unscheduled maintenance at Plant McIntosh. Depreciation and
amortization rose because of the commercial operation of two combustion turbine
peaking units in April and May 1994. Income taxes were lower because of the
change in taxable income.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under construction
and is included in rate base. The equity portion of AFUDC represents non-cash
income. In addition, when facilities are completed and included in rate base,
previously capitalized amounts increase cash flow because revenues are higher as
a result of the increased rate base and additional depreciation expense. The
amount of AFUDC recorded in 1994 was higher because of SAVANNAH's investment in
the construction of two 80 megawatt combustion turbine peaking units. These
units were placed in service in April and May 1994.

                              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations  (Continued)

Future Earnings Potential
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from growth in energy sales to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
increased costs cannot be offset. The Clean Air Act is discussed under
"Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
SAVANNAH's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors. Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, and the rate of economic growth in SAVANNAH's service area. The
enactment of the Energy Act is beginning to have a dramatic effect on the future
of the electric utility industry. A discussion of the potential impact of the
Energy Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future
Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
SAVANNAH's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     SAVANNAH is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a portion of
the company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, SAVANNAH
would be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities. See
Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of SAVANNAH's 1994 Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information.

     In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This
statement imposes stricter criteria for regulatory assets by requiring that such
assets be probable of future recovery at each balance sheet date. SAVANNAH
anticipates adopting this standard on January 1, 1996 and does not expect that
adoption will have a material impact on the financial position or results of
operations of SAVANNAH based on the current regulatory structure in which
SAVANNAH operates. This conclusion may change in the future as competitive
factors influence wholesale and retail pricing in this industry.

Financial Condition

Overview
During the first three months of 1995, SAVANNAH made gross property additions to
utility plant of $7.6 million. The funds for these additions and other capital
requirements came from operating activities, principally from earnings and
noncash charges to income such as depreciation. See the Condensed Statements of
Cash Flows for further details.

                              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Financial Condition  (Continued)

Capital Requirements for Construction
SAVANNAH's construction program is budgeted at $87 million for the three years
1995 through 1997 ($34 million in 1995, $27 million in 1996 and $26 million in
1997). Actual construction costs may vary from this estimate because of such
factors as changes in business conditions; changes in environmental regulations;
the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; revised
load growth estimates and changes in cost of capital. Such construction
expenditures will be incurred for transmission and distribution facilities and
the upgrading and extension of the useful lives of generating plants.

     Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the
Southern electric system's capital requirements and operating costs. The acid
rain compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will have a significant impact on
the Southern electric system. This legislation, as well as other legislation and
regulations, are described under "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 -
Management's Discussion and Analysis in SAVANNAH's 1994 Annual Report on Form
10-K. The full impact of these requirements cannot be determined at this time,
pending the development and implementation of applicable regulations. There can
be no assurance that compliance costs will be recovered through corresponding
increases in rates.

Sources of Capital
At March 31, 1995, SAVANNAH had $27.0 million of unused credit arrangements with
banks to meet its short-term cash needs. SAVANNAH had $3.0 million of short-term
debt outstanding at quarter-end. Additionally, SAVANNAH has $1.1 million of
leases maturing by March 31, 1996. SAVANNAH has received the authority from the
SEC to have outstanding at any one time an amount of up to $70 million in
short-term borrowings.

     It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be derived
from operations and the sale of additional first mortgage bonds and preferred
stock and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. SAVANNAH is required to meet
certain coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate
charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. SAVANNAH's
coverage ratios are sufficiently high to permit, at present interest rate
levels, any foreseeable security sales. The amount of securities which SAVANNAH
will be permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market conditions and
other factors prevailing at that time.

      Form 10-K for information with respect to a civil complaint filed
      regarding ALABAMA's financing of heat pumps and other merchandise.

(E)   Pursuant to orders from the Georgia PSC, GEORGIA deferred financing and
      depreciation costs under phase-in plans for Plant Vogtle units 1 and 2
      until the allowed investment was fully reflected in rates as of October
      1991. In addition, the Georgia PSC issued two separate accounting orders
      that required GEORGIA to defer substantially all operating and financing
      costs related to both units until rate orders addressed these costs. The
      Georgia PSC orders provide for recovery of deferred costs within 10 years.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued)

     The Georgia PSC also ordered GEORGIA to levelize declining capacity buyback
     expense from the co-owners of the plant over a six-year period beginning
     October 1991. The unamortized balance of these deferred costs at March 31,
     1995, was $404 million.


(F)   Reference is made to Note 4 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report on
      Form 10-K for information concerning the uncertainty related to the
      actions of regulatory authorities with respect to the recovery of costs of
      the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project. The ultimate
      outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

(G)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report on
      Form 10-K for information regarding recovery of GEORGIA's costs from
      demand-side conservation programs. The final outcome of this matter cannot
      now be determined; however, in management's opinion, the final outcome
      will not have a material adverse effect on SOUTHERN's or GEORGIA's
      Condensed Financial Statements.

(H)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report on
      Form 10-K for information regarding a tax deficiency notice received from
      the Internal Revenue Service relating to GEORGIA's tax accounting for the
      sale in 1984 of an interest in Plant Vogtle and related capacity and
      energy buyback commitments. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be
      determined; however, in management's opinion, the final outcome will not
      have a material adverse effect on SOUTHERN's or GEORGIA's Condensed
      Financial Statements.

(I)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of GEORGIA in Item
      8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for
      information regarding joint complaints filed by OPC and MEAG seeking
      recovery from GEORGIA for alleged partial requirements rates overcharges
      plus interest. While the outcome of this matter cannot now be determined,
      in management's opinion, it will not have a material adverse effect on
      GEORGIA's Condensed Financial Statements.

(J)   Reference is made to Note 3 and Note 4 to the financial statements of
      SOUTHERN and GEORGIA, respectively, in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's
      combined 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on certain
      environmental contingencies.

PART II        -     OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.              Legal Proceedings.

               (1)  Reference is made to the Notes to Condensed Financial
                    Statements herein for information regarding certain legal
                    and administrative proceedings in which SOUTHERN and its
                    reporting subsidiaries are involved.

               (2)  In May 1994, GEORGIA received a notice of violation from the
                    NRC proposing a civil penalty in the amount of $200,000
                    based upon allegedly inaccurate and incomplete information
                    relating to Plant Vogtle reported to the NRC in 1990. The
                    NRC also issued demands for information regarding alleged
                    performance failures by six individual employees to enable
                    the NRC to determine whether additional enforcement actions
                    are necessary. GEORGIA submitted responses to such notice of
                    violation and demands in August 1994 and February 1995.

                        In February 1995, the NRC issued a modified notice of
                    violation in which it withdrew one of the five violations
                    initially alleged and again proposed a $200,000 civil
                    penalty. The NRC also determined that, subject to certain
                    commitments with respect to one individual employee, no
                    additional enforcement sanctions were warranted.

                        GEORGIA has paid the civil penalty proposed by the NRC,
                    and this matter is now concluded.

               (3)  Reference is made to Item 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS in the
                    SOUTHERN system's combined 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-K
                    for information regarding GEORGIA's designation as a
                    potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
                    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.
