           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

   This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements
in addition to historical information. The registrants caution that there are
various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those indicated in the forward-looking statements; accordingly, there can
be no assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These factors
include legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and
restructuring of the electric utility industry; the extent and timing of the
entry of additional competition in the markets of SOUTHERN's subsidiaries;
potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets
or businesses, internal restructuring or other restructuring options, that may
be pursued by the registrants; state and federal rate regulation in the United
States; changes in or application of environmental and other laws and
regulations to which SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries are subject; political, legal
and economic conditions and developments in the United States and in foreign
countries in which the subsidiaries operate; financial market conditions and the
results of financing efforts; changes in commodity prices and interest rates;
weather and other natural phenomena; the performance of projects undertaken by
the non-traditional business and the success of efforts to invest in and develop
new opportunities; and other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in other
reports (including Form 10-K) filed from time to time by the registrants with
the SEC.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                  SECOND QUARTER 2000 vs. SECOND QUARTER 1999
                                       AND
                     YEAR-TO-DATE 2000 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 1999

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SOUTHERN's traditional business is primarily represented
by its five integrated Southeast utilities, which provide electric service in
four states. Another significant portion of SOUTHERN's business is represented
by Southern Energy, which develops and manages domestic and international
electricity and other energy-related businesses for SOUTHERN. Businesses
acquired by Southern Energy have been included in the consolidated statements of
income since the date of acquisition. Certain changes in operating revenues and
expenses from the prior period result from such acquisitions. Reference is made
to Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for
information relating to the planned initial public offering and subsequent
spin-off of Southern Energy.

Earnings

SOUTHERN's consolidated net income for the second quarter and
year-to-date 2000 was $342 million ($0.52 per share) and $587 million ($0.90 per
share), respectively, compared to $314 million ($0.45 per share) and $538
million ($0.77 per share) for the corresponding periods of 1999. For the
integrated Southeast utilities, earnings were up by $18 million or 6.8% and $26
million or 5.7% for the second quarter and year-to-date 2000, respectively, due
primarily to higher operating revenues. Earnings for Southern Energy were up by
$16 million or 21.1% and $29 million or 17.8% for the second quarter and
year-to-date 2000, respectively, when compared to the same periods of the
previous year. The increase in Southern Energy's earnings is mainly due to the
growing profitability from its Asian business units, primarily due to the Sual
generating units being placed in service during the latter part of 1999.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Operating revenues. Operating revenues for the integrated Southeast
utilities increased $229 million or 10.2% during the second quarter of 2000 and
$352 million or 8.5% year-to-date 2000 due primarily to increased customer base,
warmer weather and growth in the wholesale energy supply business in the
Southeast. Southern Energy's operating revenues increased $170 million or 33.7%
and $169 million or 16.5% for the second quarter and year-to-date 2000
reflecting increased energy sales as a result of additional generating units
placed into service.

     Fuel expense. These increases for the current quarter and year-to-date 2000
can be attributed primarily to Southern Energy. Fuel expense for Southern Energy
increased $152 million or 225.7% for the second quarter and $235 million or
216.1% year-to-date 2000. The increases are primarily attributed to the
increased generation at plants in New York and California, which were acquired
during 1999. Fuel expense for the integrated Southeast utilities was up due
primarily to increased generation in order to meet energy demands.

     Purchased power expense. The decreases in purchased power expense for the
second quarter and year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same periods in 1999
are primarily attributed to Southern Energy and were partially offset by
increases in purchased power expense for the integrated Southeast utilities.
Southern Energy's purchased power expense decreased $135 million or 84.9% and
$333 million or 86.0%, respectively, for the second quarter and year-to-date
2000 as a result of the sale in 1999 of the former South Western Electricity
plc's supply business to London Electricity plc. For the integrated Southeast
utilities, purchased power expense increased $71 million or 83.8% for the second
quarter of 2000 and $99 million or 75.3% year-to-date 2000 due to higher demand
for energy.

     Other operation expense. During the second quarter and year-to-date 2000,
the increases in other operation expense are mainly attributed to Southern
Energy. Southern Energy's other operation expense was up by $62 million or 77.6%
for the current quarter and $36 million or 22.3% year-to-date 2000 as compared
to the corresponding periods in 1999. The increases were primarily due to the
acquisitions of generating assets in New York and California and the new Sual
plant in the Philippines being placed into service in 1999. For the integrated
Southeast utilities, other operation expense increased for the current quarter
and year-to-date 2000 due primarily to increased costs related to employee
severance costs and customer service expense.

     Maintenance expense. For the integrated Southeast utilities, maintenance
expense was up $7 million or 3.4% and $19 million or 4.8%, respectively, for the
second quarter and year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same periods in 1999.
These increases are attributed to a major, planned outage on a fossil power
generation facility and maintenance on overhead lines. Southern Energy's
maintenance expenses increased during second quarter and year-to-date 2000 by
$12 million or 46.1% and $19 million or 37.9%, respectively, when compared to
the same periods in 1999 due primarily to the acquisitions in 1999 of generating
assets in New York and California.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. For the integrated Southeast
utilities, this item increased $41 million or 15.5% in the second quarter of
2000 and $70 million or 13.5% year-to-date 2000 primarily as a result of
accelerated amortization and depreciation by GEORGIA in accordance with the
three-year rate order approved by the Georgia PSC. See Note (H) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further details regarding the
retail rate order. Southern Energy's depreciation and amortization expense was
higher for the current quarter by $26 million or 45.3% and $58 million or 51.8%
year-to-date 2000 due to the increase in generating assets in Asia and North
America.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. The decreases in this
item for the second quarter and year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same
periods in 1999 are attributed to a number of factors at Southern Energy. The
decrease in the second quarter 2000 primarily relates to reduced earnings from
the energy trading and marketing joint venture and continued price competition
in Germany. The majority of the year-to-date 2000 decrease results from a $54
million settlement recognized during the first quarter of 1999 representing
claims against a contractor for the Shajiao C construction project in China. The
settlement was partially offset by related expenses included in other income
accounts and income taxes.

     Other, net. For the current quarter and year-to-date 2000, Southern
Energy's other, net increased $31 million or 179.4% and $14 million or 24.7%,
respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods in 1999. These
increases are primarily the result of the settlement of a commercial dispute
with an outside advisor and additional lease income. For the integrated
Southeast utilities, the increases in other, net for the current quarter and
year-to-date 2000 are attributed primarily to ALABAMA's increase in the equity
portion of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction as a result of an
increase in the capitalization base.

     Interest on long-term debt. For the second quarter and year-to-date 2000,
the increases in interest on long-term debt are primarily attributed to Southern
Energy and represent increased amounts outstanding for long-term debt.

     Interest on notes payable. During the second quarter and year-to-date 2000,
when compared to the corresponding periods of 1999, the increases in interest on
notes payable are attributed to SOUTHERN's increased use of commercial paper and
to Southern Energy's acquisition financing.

     Other interest charges, net. These decreases for the current quarter and
year-to-date 2000 are primarily attributed to an increase in ALABAMA's Allowance
for Funds Used During Construction resulting in a larger credit to interest
expense than was recorded in the corresponding periods for 1999. Also, there was
a decrease in interest charges related to the nuclear decommissioning trust,
which was offset by a concurrent reduction of interest income in accordance with
FERC requirements.

      Income taxes. The year-to-date 2000 decrease is primarily due to a tax
provision of $28 million in 1999 related to the Shajiao C settlement discussed
previously. In addition, in February 2000 an agreement with the United Kingdom
Inland Revenue related to prior year tax computations at WPD resulted in a $20
million reduction.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment. For additional information relating to Southern Energy
and other businesses, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Southern Energy" and "Other
Business" in the Form 10-K. Also, reference is made to Note (N) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for information relating to the
planned initial public offering and subsequent spin-off of Southern Energy.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     On December 20, 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs. Reference is
made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings
Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for information on this matter.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Protection Agency Litigation" and Note 3 to the financial
statements of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by January 2001. In June 2000, the
FASB issued Statement No. 138, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.
These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. SOUTHERN has not yet quantified the
impact of adopting these statements on its financial statements; however, the
adoption could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income.

      In June 2000, SOUTHERN, through its subsidiary Southern Energy, announced
an agreement with Potomac Electric Power Company ("PEPCO") to purchase PEPCO's
generating business in Maryland and Virginia, assume PEPCO's entitlements under
various power purchase agreements, operate two power stations in Washington,
D.C. retained by PEPCO, and supply PEPCO with power required to meet its retail
obligations for up to four years pursuant to transition power agreements. The
purchase price of this transaction is $2.65 billion plus amounts to be
determined for working capital and reimbursement of capital expenditures, and
approximately $260 million in the event certain power purchase agreements are
not transferred to Southern Energy. This transaction is expected to close in
November 2000.

     On Friday, August 11, 2000, WPD Limited ("WPDL"), an indirect
49% owned  subsidiary of Southern Energy, submitted an offer of
365 pence per share for the entire ordinary share capital of Hyder plc which
owns and runs the electricity network in South Wales and the water
distribution  and waste water treatment business for all of Wales.  This
represents a total purchase price of (pound)559 million ($838 million).
Friday was the last day for submission of revised offers,  no
other revised offers were submitted, and WPDL was informed by the Takeover
Panel in the United  Kingdom that it was the higher bidder.  WPDL's  increased
bid has not yet been formally announced  pending the  outcome of an appeal by
the other  party  competing to acquire Hyder against a ruling of the Panel
Executive  allowing the WPDL bid to proceed.  If WPDL's bid is successful,  it
is intended that WPD will become involved in the management of the electricity
network in South Wales.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first six months of
2000 included $1.2 billion used for gross property additions to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were from
operations, short-term borrowings and other long-term debt. See SOUTHERN's
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details. Reference
is made to the SOUTHERN's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive
Income herein for information relating to other comprehensive income.

Financing Activities

During the first six months of 2000, maturities of the integrated Southeast
utilities' first mortgage bonds totaled $200 million. In February 2000, GEORGIA
issued $300 million of floating rate senior notes due February 22, 2002. The
proceeds of the sale were used to repay a portion of GEORGIA's outstanding
short-term indebtedness. In March 2000, MISSISSIPPI issued $100 million of
floating rate senior notes due March 28, 2002. The proceeds were used to prepay
bank loans of $45 million maturing in November 2001 and $5 million maturing in
October 2002. The balance was used to repay a portion of MISSISSIPPI's
outstanding short-term indebtedness. In May 2000, ALABAMA issued $250 million of
7.85% senior notes due May 15, 2003. The proceeds of the sale were used to repay
a portion of ALABAMA's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     Reference is made to "Future Earnings Potential" herein for the discussion
of the agreement between SOUTHERN, through its subsidiary Southern Energy, and
PEPCO. To fund the purchase price of this transaction, Southern Energy plans to
enter into lease financing arrangements for a significant portion of the PEPCO
assets which are expected to provide $1.5 billion; to issue $1.02 billion of
debt at Southern Energy North America Generating, Inc., a Southern Energy
subsidiary, of which approximately $938 million will be drawn at closing; and to
provide the balance from committed credit lines.

     Reference is made to Note (M) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for discussion of a program to repurchase SOUTHERN's common
stock.

     The market price of SOUTHERN's common stock at June 30, 2000 was $23.3125
per share and the book value was $13.75 per share, representing a market-to-book
ratio of 170%, compared to $23.50, $13.82 and 170%, respectively, at the end of
1999. The dividend for the second quarter of 2000 was $0.335 per share.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements for Construction", "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for a description of the SOUTHERN system's
capital requirements for its construction program, sinking fund requirements and
maturing debt, and environmental compliance efforts. Approximately $388 million
will be required by June 30, 2001 for redemptions and maturities of long-term
debt. Also, the integrated Southeast utilities plan to continue, to the extent
possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace
these securities with lower-cost capital.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 2000, as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
integrated Southeast utilities plan to obtain the funds required for
construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past.
The amount, type and timing of any financings--if needed--will depend upon
maintenance of adequate earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market
conditions and other factors. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in
the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
June 30, 2000, approximately $788 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $6.2 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. These
unused credit arrangements also provide liquidity support to variable rate
pollution control bonds and commercial paper programs. At June 30, 2000, the
SOUTHERN system companies had outstanding approximately $2.4 billion of
short-term notes payable and $2.3 billion of commercial paper. Management
believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing
lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

     See Note (D) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for discussion of financial derivative contracts entered into by SOUTHERN.

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
and year-to-date 2000 was $103.2 million and $170.7 million, respectively,
compared to $93.0 million and $156.1 million for the corresponding periods of
1999. Earnings for the current quarter and year-to-date 2000 increased $10.1
million or 10.9% and $14.6 million or 9.3%, respectively, due primarily to
increases in operating revenues, which were partially offset by higher operating
expenses.

</TABLE>

     Retail sales. Retail sales revenues were higher for the second quarter and
year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same periods in 1999 due mainly to
increases in retail energy sales of 5.1% and 4.2% for the respective periods.
Retail energy sales increased due primarily to warmer weather and strong
commercial growth.

     Sales for resale-non-affiliates. These revenues increased in the second
quarter and year-to-date 2000 due primarily to increased unit power sales and
increased sales for resale within ALABAMA's service area. Revenues from unit
power sales for the current quarter and year-to-date 2000 increased as a result
of higher energy sales and an adjustment recorded in the second quarter of 1999
lowering the return under formula rate contracts. Territorial sales for resale
increased for the current quarter and year-to-date 2000 as a result of warmer
weather. Energy is usually sold at variable cost and has no significant impact
on earnings.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies within the SOUTHERN system, as
well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. Increased amounts of purchased power were
needed to meet territorial demand for the second quarter and year-to-date 2000
to offset decreased nuclear and hydro power generation related to a refueling
and steam generator replacement outage and lower stream flows, respectively.

     Maintenance expense. These expenditures increased for the current quarter
and year-to-date 2000 primarily due to higher costs related to a major, planned
outage on a fossil power generation facility and increased maintenance of
overhead lines.

     Interest income. This item was lower for the current quarter and
year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same periods in 1999 due primarily to a
decrease in recognized gains on investments held by the nuclear decommissioning
trust. Interest income related to the nuclear decommissioning trust was offset
by a concurrent reduction of other interest charges in accordance with FERC
requirements.

     Other, net. The increase for the second quarter and year-to-date 2000 was
primarily due to an increase in the equity portion of Allowance for Funds Used
During Construction as a result of an increase in the capitalization base.

     Interest on long-term debt. Interest on long-term debt increased in the
second quarter and year-to-date 2000 primarily due to the issuance of $450
million of senior notes in the last half of 1999 and $250 million in the current
quarter.

     Other interest charges, net. The decreases in other interest charges for
the second quarter and year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same periods in
1999 are primarily attributed to an increase in Allowance for Funds Used During
Construction resulting in a larger credit to interest expense than was recorded
in the corresponding periods for 1999. Also, there was a decrease in interest
charges related to the nuclear decommissioning trust, which was offset by a
concurrent reduction of interest income in accordance with FERC requirements.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, ALABAMA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     On December 20, 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on Regional
Transmission Organizations (RTOs). Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in the Form
10-K for information on this matter.

Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.
These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts - and for hedging activities. ALABAMA has not yet quantified the
impact of adopting these statements on its financial statements; however, the
adoption could increase volatility in earnings.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first six months of
2000 included the addition of approximately $391.4 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. See ALABAMA's
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first six months of 2000, maturities of first mortgage bonds by
ALABAMA totaled $100 million. In May 2000, ALABAMA issued $250 million of 7.85%
senior notes due May 15, 2003. The proceeds of the sale were used to repay a
portion of ALABAMA's outstanding short-term indebtedness. ALABAMA will continue
to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital as market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of ALABAMA
under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital requirements
for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental compliance
efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at June 30,
2000, approximately $24.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, had unused
committed lines of credit of approximately $902 million (including $418 million
of such lines under which borrowings may be made only to fund purchase
obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds) and an extendible
commercial note program. ALABAMA has regulatory authority for up to $750 million
of short-term borrowings. At June 30, 2000, ALABAMA had outstanding $196 million
of commercial paper and $24 million of notes payable to banks.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of June 30, 2000, and the related condensed statements of income for
the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 and cash
flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2000 and 1999. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of
December 31, 1999 (not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 16,
2000, we expressed an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the
information set forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December
31, 1999 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance
sheet from which it has been derived.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   SECOND QUARTER 2000 vs. SECOND QUARTER 1999

                     YEAR-TO-DATE 2000 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 1999


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
and year-to-date 2000 was $148.5 million and $242.2 million, respectively,
compared to $138.6 million and $230.2 million for the corresponding periods in
1999. The second quarter 2000 increase of $10.0 million or 7.2% and the
year-to-date increase of $12.1 million or 5.2% are primarily attributed to
higher operating revenues which were partially offset by higher operating
expenses, including additional accelerated amortization and depreciation
required under GEORGIA's three-year rate order.

     Retail sales. Retail sales revenues were higher for the second quarter and
year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same periods in 1999 due mainly to
increases in retail energy sales of 7.5% and 6.1% for the respective periods.
Retail energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers were up
by 11.3%, 9.5% and 3.4% for the second quarter of 2000 and 8.0%, 8.5% and 3.0%
year-to-date 2000, respectively. Retail energy sales increased due primarily to
growth in the number of customers and warmer weather than in the corresponding
periods of 1999.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. The increases in these sales to
non-affiliates in the second quarter and year-to-date 2000 are attributed to
higher demand for energy by non-affiliates. These transactions did not have a
significant impact on earnings.

     Sales for resale - affiliates. Revenues from sales for resale to affiliated
companies within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending
on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
These transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operating revenues. The year-to-date 2000 increase is primarily
attributed to the recognition of the open-access transmission tariff settlement
in 1999.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Fuel expense. This expense is higher for the second quarter and
year-to-date 2000, when compared to the same periods of the prior year, due
primarily to increased generation from fossil-fueled plants to meet higher
energy demands and higher natural gas and oil prices. These expenses do not have
a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by
energy revenues.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. Increased demand for energy as well as
the drought in GEORGIA's service area, and increased prices for natural gas and
oil, resulted in the increases in purchased power for the current quarter and
year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same periods of 1999. These expenses do
not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally
offset by energy revenues.

     Other operation expense. These expenses were higher in the second quarter
and year-to-date 2000 as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year
due primarily to increased costs related to employee severance costs and
customer service expense.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. For the second quarter and
year-to-date 2000, the increases in this expense are attributable to accelerated
amortization and depreciation required by the three-year rate order which became
effective January 1, 1999 and increased in-service property, plant and
equipment. See Note (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements"
herein for further details regarding the retail rate order.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including weather, regulatory matters and energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GEORGIA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form
10-K.

     Effective January 1, 1999, GEORGIA began operating under a new three-year
retail rate order. Under the order, GEORGIA's earnings are evaluated against a
retail return on common equity range of 10% to 12.5%. In compliance with the
order, retail rates were decreased by $24 million on an annual basis effective
January 1, 2000. Reference is made to Note (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings. For additional information, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the
Form 10-K.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by January 2001. In June 2000, the
FASB issued Statement No. 138, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.
These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts - and for hedging activities. GEORGIA has not yet quantified the
impact of adopting these statements on its financial statements; however, the
adoption could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (H), (I) and (O) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first six months of
2000 was the addition of approximately $456.8 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. See GEORGIA's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first six months of 2000, maturities of first mortgage bonds by
GEORGIA totaled $100 million. In February 2000, GEORGIA issued $300 million of
floating rate senior notes due February 22, 2002. The proceeds of the sale were
used to repay a portion of GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Issues" in the
Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital requirements for its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at June 30,
2000, approximately $15.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$1.8 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. The credit arrangements
provide liquidity support to GEORGIA's obligations with respect to variable rate
pollution control bonds and its commercial paper program. At June 30, 2000,
GEORGIA had outstanding $398.2 million of commercial paper. Management believes
that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of
credit without maintaining large cash balances.

                                ARTHUR ANDERSEN



                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of June 30, 2000, and the related condensed
statements of income for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30,
2000 and 1999 and cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2000 and
1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of
December 31, 1999 (not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 16,
2000, we expressed an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the
information set forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December
31, 1999, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance
sheet from which it has been derived.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter and
year-to-date 2000 was $12.9 million and $17.6 million, respectively, compared to
$13.2 million and $18.0 million for the same periods in 1999. Although operating
revenues increased, earnings decreased slightly due primarily to changes in
interest on long-term debt and notes payable.

     Retail sales. Excluding the recovery of fuel expense and certain other
expenses that do not affect net income, retail sales revenues increased slightly
during the second quarter and year-to-date 2000 when compared to the
corresponding periods of the prior year. Retail energy sales increased 4.9% and
5.1% during the second quarter and year-to-date 2000, respectively, when
compared to the same periods in 1999. These increases were due primarily to
growth in the number of retail customers served by GULF. The year-to-date 2000
increase in energy sales was offset, for the most part, by retail base rate
reductions and the recording of estimated revenues to be shared under GULF's
Sharing Plan, which was approved by the Florida PSC in October 1999. For
additional information regarding the reduction to retail base rates and the
Sharing Plan, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. Increased revenues from unit power
energy sales were the primary reason for the second quarter and year-to-date
2000 increases when compared to the same periods in 1999. Energy is usually sold
at variable cost and has no significant impact on net income.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Sales for resale - affiliates. Revenues from sales for resale to affiliated
companies within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending
on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operating revenues. These revenues were down in the second quarter
and year-to-date 2000 due primarily to a decrease in fuel, conservation and
capacity clause revenues. The decreases in these revenues were a result of
adjustments to reflect differences between recoverable costs and the amounts
actually reflected in current rates. The recovery provisions generally equal the
related expenses and have no material effect on net income.

     Fuel expense. For the second quarter and year-to-date 2000, fuel expense
increased due mainly to increased generation in order to meet the demand for
energy and a higher average cost of fuel consumed.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increases during the second
quarter and year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same periods in the prior
year are primarily attributed to an increase in energy purchases due to
increased power marketing activities, the majority of which were resold to
non-affiliated third parties. These transactions had no significant effect on
net income.

     Other operation expense. These expenses were higher for the second quarter
and year-to-date 2000 due primarily to increased expenses associated with higher
variable payroll costs, as well as a higher provision for uncollectible accounts
when compared to the same periods in 1999.

     Maintenance expense. For the second quarter and year-to-date 2000, these
expenses decreased when compared to the corresponding periods of 1999 due
primarily to scheduled outages during the first half of 1999.

     Taxes other than income taxes. The increases in these taxes for the current
quarter and year-to-date 2000 are primarily due to higher franchise fees and
gross receipt taxes related to increases in GULF's billed revenues. These
collections are also included in other operating revenues and have no impact on
earnings.

     Other, net. The second quarter 2000 decrease, when compared to the same
period in 1999, is attributed, for the most part, to expenses related to the
discontinuance of GULF's appliance sales division. The year-to-date 2000
decrease is primarily attributed to the discontinuance of GULF's appliance sales
division, as well as an increase in expenditures related to environmental
advocacy when compared to the same period in 1999.

     Interest on long-term debt. Interest on long-term debt increased during the
second quarter and year-to-date 2000 due mainly to the issuance of senior notes
during the latter half of 1999.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed
at federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GULF is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition.  For

additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the
Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

      On November 4, 1999, the Florida PSC approved GULF's plan to reduce its
authorized rate of return, reduce retail base rates and share revenues with its
customers. For additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     On December 20, 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs. Reference is
made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings
Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K for information on this matter.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Protection Agency Litigation" and Note 3 to the financial
statements of GULF in the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by January 2001. In June 2000, the
FASB issued Statement No. 138, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.
These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts - and for hedging activities. GULF has not yet quantified the impact
of adopting these statements on its financial statements; however, the adoption
could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (O) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first six months of 2000
included the addition of approximately $48.5 million to utility plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

GULF plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost
debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and "Other
Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of GULF's capital
requirements for its construction program, environmental compliance efforts and
maturing debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at June 30, 2000,
approximately $854 thousand of cash and cash equivalents and $46.5 million of
unused committed lines of credit with banks in addition to $61.9 million
liquidity support for GULF's obligations with respect to variable rate pollution
control bonds. At June 30, 2000, GULF had $58 million outstanding of notes
payable to banks. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second
quarter and year-to-date 2000 was $12.2 million and $18.9 million, respectively,
compared to $14.9 million and $22.1 million for the corresponding periods of
1999. Earnings decreased during the second quarter and year-to-date 2000 by $2.7
million or 18.2% and $3.2 million or 14.4%, respectively, due to increased
operating expenses.

</TABLE>


     Retail sales. Retail sales revenues were up in the second quarter and
year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same periods of 1999 due to increased
energy sales to the retail sector of 5.7% and 7.6 %, respectively. Retail energy
sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers increased by 5.5%,
3.7% and 7.1% for the second quarter 2000 and 5.2%, 6.3% and 9.6% for
year-to-date 2000, respectively, due primarily to growth in the number of
customers, warmer weather and new industrial load.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. The increases in these sales for the
current quarter and year-to-date 2000 are primarily due to the continuing
economic growth in the areas served by rural cooperatives in Mississippi.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. Fuel expense increased during the second quarter and
year-to-date 2000 due mainly to higher unit cost of fuel and, during the second
quarter, increased generation to meet energy demands.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. For the second quarter and year-to-date
2000, purchased power from non-affiliates increased as a result of increased
demand for energy.

     Maintenance expense. These costs increased in the second quarter and
year-to-date 2000 due to scheduled maintenance performed on steam power
generation facilities.

     Depreciation and amortization. The increases in this expense for the
current quarter and year-to-date 2000 when compared to the same periods in 1999
are primarily attributed to additional distribution facilities and a new higher
depreciation rate approved by the Mississippi PSC.

     Interest on long-term debt. These interest payments were higher in the
second quarter and year-to-date 2000 due mainly to higher interest rates being
charged on a variable rate long-term debt outstanding.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment. Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in
rates under the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force
on electric rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking place. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K. See Note (J) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for information regarding
an agreement between MISSISSIPPI and certain of its wholesale customers to
reduce rates.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, MISSISSIPPI is positioning
the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. MISSISSIPPI's 2000 ECO Plan filing was approved, as
filed, by the Mississippi PSC on March 22, 2000 and resulted in a slight
decrease in customer prices. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     On December 20, 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs. Reference is
made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings
Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K for information on this matter.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in
the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

                            MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     In May 2000, the Mississippi PSC ordered that its docket reviewing
restructuring of the electric industry in the State of Mississippi be suspended.
The Mississippi PSC found that retail competition may not be in the public
interest at this time and ordered that no further formal hearings would be held
on this subject. It found that the current regulatory structure had produced
reliable low cost power and "should not be changed without clear and convincing
demonstration that change would be in the public interest." The Mississippi PSC
will continue to monitor retail and wholesale restructuring activities
throughout the United States and reserved "its right to order further formal
hearings on the matter should new evidence demonstrate that retail competition
would be in the public interest and all customers could receive a reduction in
the total cost of their electric service."

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by January 2001. In June 2000, the
FASB issued Statement No. 138, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.
These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts - and for hedging activities. MISSISSIPPI has not yet quantified the
impact of adopting these statements on its financial statements; however, the
adoption could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (J) and (O) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first six months
of 2000 included the addition of approximately $44.9 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. See
MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

In March 2000, MISSISSIPPI issued $100 million of floating rate senior notes due
March 28, 2002. The proceeds were used to prepay bank loans of $45 million
maturing in November 2001 and $5 million maturing in October 2002. The balance
was used to repay a portion of MISSISSIPPI's outstanding short-term
indebtedness. MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program
to retire higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" and Note 3 to the financial statements
in the Form 10-K for a description of MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its
construction program, environmental compliance efforts, sinking fund
requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at June
30, 2000, approximately $11 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $99.3 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks.
At June 30, 2000, MISSISSIPPI had short-term notes payable outstanding of $47
million. Management believes that the need for working capital can be adequately
met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   SECOND QUARTER 2000 vs. SECOND QUARTER 1999
                                       AND
                     YEAR-TO-DATE 2000 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 1999


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
and year-to-date 2000 was $6.3 million and $7.9 million, respectively, as
compared to $5.3 million and $6.5 million for the corresponding periods of 1999.
Earnings for the current quarter and year-to-date 2000 were higher due primarily
to increased operating revenues, partially offset by increased operating
expenses.

     Retail sales. Retail sales revenues for the second quarter and year-to-date
2000 were higher than the same periods in 1999 due primarily to increased retail
energy sales. Total retail energy sales were up 8.3% for the second quarter and
8.2% year-to-date 2000 due primarily to growth in the number of customers
serviced by SAVANNAH and warmer temperatures during the second quarter of 2000.
Energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers for the second
quarter and year-to-date 2000 increased by 9.5%, 9.6% and 3.4% and 9.0%, 9.8%
and 4.5%, respectively.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. This expense increased in the second quarter and year-to-date
2000 reflecting higher fuel prices. The year-to-date 2000 increase was also
affected by increased generation in order to meet energy demands.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

      Purchased power - non-affiliates. For the second quarter and year-to-date
2000, purchased power increased reflecting higher demand for energy and
increased costs for purchased power. These transactions do not have a
significant impact on earnings.

      Other operation expense. The increases in this item for the second quarter
and year-to-date 2000, when compared to the same periods in 1999, result from
higher employee benefits expenses.

      Maintenance expense. During the second quarter and year-to-date 2000,
maintenance expense increased due mainly to an unscheduled maintenance outage at
one of SAVANNAH's older plants and a major boiler outage at one of the coal
plants.

      Interest on notes payable. The increases in this item for the second
quarter and year-to-date 2000, when compared to the same periods in 1999, result
from the increased outstanding amount of short-term debt and higher interest
rates in 2000.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     In 1998, the Georgia PSC approved a four-year accounting order for
SAVANNAH. Reference is made to Note (K) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SAVANNAH is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     On December 20, 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs. Reference is
made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings
Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K for information on this matter.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of SAVANNAH in
the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     The FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, which must be adopted by January 2001. In June 2000, the
FASB issued Statement No. 138, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.
These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. SAVANNAH has not yet quantified the
impact of adopting these statements on its financial statements; however, the
adoption could increase volatility in earnings.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (K) and (O) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first six months of
2000 included the addition of approximately $13.3 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations and credit arrangements with banks. See SAVANNAH's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at June 30,
2000, approximately $4.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$49.5 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks. At June 30,
2000, SAVANNAH had $41.7 million outstanding of notes payable to banks. Since
SAVANNAH has no major generating plants under construction, management believes
that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of
credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)   The condensed financial statements of the registrants included herein
      have been prepared by each registrant, without audit, pursuant to the
      rules and regulations of the SEC.  In the opinion of each
      registrant's management, the information regarding such registrant
      furnished herein reflects all adjustments necessary to present fairly the
      results of operations for the periods ended June 30, 2000 and 1999.
      Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
      financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or
      omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although each registrant
      believes that the disclosures regarding such registrant are adequate to
      make the information presented not misleading.  It is suggested
      that these condensed financial statements of each registrant be read in
      conjunction with the financial statements of such registrant and the
      notes thereto included in the Form 10-K.  Certain prior period
      amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period
      presentation.  Due to seasonal variations in the demand for energy,
      operating results for the periods presented do not necessarily indicate
      operating results for the entire year.

      The condensed financial statements of ALABAMA and GEORGIA included herein
      have been reviewed by ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's independent public
      accountants as set forth in their reports included herein as Exhibit 1 to
      ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)   The integrated Southeast utilities are subject to the provisions of FASB
      Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
      Regulation. In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no
      longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
      off related unrecoverable regulatory assets and liabilities, and determine
      if any other assets have been impaired. For additional information, see
      Note 1 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the
      Form 10-K.

(C)   The staff of the SEC has questioned  certain of the current accounting
      practices    of    the    electric     utility     industry--including
      SOUTHERN's--regarding the recognition,  measurement and classification
      of  decommissioning  costs for nuclear  generating  facilities  in the
      financial  statements.  In response to these  questions,  the FASB has
      decided  to review  the  accounting  for  obligations  related  to the
      retirement of long-lived  assets,  including nuclear  decommissioning.
      Reference is made to  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS - "Future
      Earnings  Potential"  of  SOUTHERN,  ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 7 and
      Note 1 to the financial  statements  of SOUTHERN,  ALABAMA and GEORGIA
      under "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K.

(D)   SOUTHERN engages in price risk management activities. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Derivative Financial Instruments"
      and Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for a discussion of these activities. Activities for non-trading
      purposes consist of transactions to mitigate SOUTHERN's risk related to
      interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. At June 30,
      2000, the status of outstanding non-trading related derivative contracts
      was as follows:

      In January 1998, Southern Energy and Vastar Resources, Inc. combined their
      energy trading and marketing activities to form a joint venture. Southern
      Energy's 60% investment in the joint venture is accounted for under the
      equity method of accounting. SOUTHERN, Southern Energy and Vastar have
      made guarantees to certain counterparties regarding performance of
      contractual commitments by the joint venture. At June 30, 2000,
      outstanding guarantees related to the estimated fair value of net
      contractual commitments were approximately $278 million. SOUTHERN and
      Southern Energy have also made financial guarantees related to the
      joint venture as follows:

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)



(H)  Reference  is  made  to  Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of
     SOUTHERN  and GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for  information
     concerning  a three-year  rate order  approved by the Georgia PSC
     effective  January 1, 1999.  The order  decreased  annual  retail
     rates  by  $262  million  effective  January  1,  1999  and by an
     additional  $24  million  effective  January 1,  2000.  The order
     further  provides  for  $85  million  each  year,  plus up to $50
     million  annually of any earnings  above a 12.5% retail return on
     common equity during the second and third years, to be applied to
     accelerated  amortization or depreciation of assets. In May 2000,
     the  Georgia  PSC ordered  that these  funds be  maintained  in a
     regulatory  liability account instead of being applied to premium
     on  reacquired  debt as proposed by  GEORGIA.  Two-thirds  of any
     additional  earnings  above the 12.5%  return  will be applied to
     rate reductions and the remaining  one-third retained by GEORGIA.
     Pursuant  to  this  provision,   GEORGIA  recognized  accelerated
     amortization of $51 million in the second quarter and $88 million
     year-to-date  2000 and $21 million in the second  quarter and $43
     million year-to-date 1999.

(I)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
      designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
      Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
      environmental contingencies.

(J)   In April 2000,  MISSISSIPPI  reached an agreement with certain of
      its wholesale  customers to reduce its rates effective January 1,
      2000.  The  agreement  results  in an annual  rate  reduction  of
      approximately   $3  million  and  a  temporary   annualized  rate
      reduction of  approximately  $3 million for a period of 18 months
      ending  June  30,  2001.  In   anticipation   of  FERC  approval,
      MISSISSIPPI  has  accumulated  a liability for  approximately  $3
      million in  revenues  subject to refund for the six months  ended
      June 30, 2000. In addition,  MISSISSIPPI and its customers agreed
      that  neither  party  would seek a  unilateral  change to the new
      rates  prior to January 1, 2002,  except for  changes  due to the
      operation of the fuel cost adjustment clause under the tariff. In
      July 2000, the FERC accepted  MISSISSIPPI's  settlement  with its
      customers as filed.

(K)   In 1998, the Georgia PSC approved a new accounting order for SAVANNAH.
      Under this order, SAVANNAH will reduce electric rates to its small
      business customers, expense additional storm damage accruals and accrue
      additional depreciation on generating assets. For additional information
      concerning the four-year accounting order approved by the Georgia PSC in
      June 1998, reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of
      SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(L)   Reference  is  made  to  Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of
      SOUTHERN in Item 8 and to Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of the Form
      10-K for  information  relating to (i)  petitions  for Chapter 11
      bankruptcy  relief which were filed in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court
      for the Southern District of Alabama and (ii) proposed settlement
      discussions among the affected parties.  At June 30, 2000, Mobile
      Energy  had  total   assets  of  $392  million  and  senior  debt
      outstanding  of $190  million  of first  mortgage  bonds  and $72
      million related to tax-exempt  bonds. In connection with the bond
      financings, SOUTHERN provided certain limited guarantees, in lieu
      of funding debt service and  maintenance  reserve  accounts  with
      cash.  As  of  June  30,  2000,   under  an  agreement  with  the
      bondholders,  SOUTHERN  had paid $38.3  million  pursuant  to the
      guarantees.  SOUTHERN continues to have guarantees outstanding of
      certain  potential  environmental and other obligations of Mobile
      Energy  that  represent  a maximum  contingent  liability  of $21
      million at June 30, 2000. The final outcome of this matter cannot
      now be  determined.  On August 4,  2000,  Mobile  Energy  and its
      immediate parent, Mobile Energy Services Holdings,  Inc., filed a
      joint proposed plan of



                                       68

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


      reorganization with the bankruptcy court. If approved as proposed, that
      plan would result in a termination of SOUTHERN's direct and indirect
      ownership interests in both entities. That proposed plan of
      reorganization, however, would not affect SOUTHERN's ongoing guarantee
      obligations related to Mobile Energy that are described above.

(M)   In April 1999, SOUTHERN's board approved the repurchase of up to 50
      million shares of SOUTHERN's common stock over the next two years through
      open market or privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program
      was completed during the first quarter 2000.

(N)   On April 17, 2000, SOUTHERN announced that its board of directors approved
      an initial public offering of up to 19.9 percent of its Southern Energy
      subsidiary. SOUTHERN also announced that it is planning to spin-off to
      holders of SOUTHERN common stock the remaining ownership of Southern
      Energy within 12 months of the initial public offering. The spin-off will
      be subject to a number of market and other conditions. Reference is made
      to SOUTHERN's Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 17, 2000 for
      additional information.

      On April 21, 2000, Southern Energy filed a registration statement with the
      SEC for the initial public offering of Southern Energy shares. Southern
      Energy filed an amendment to such registration statement on July 18, 2000.
      The offering is expected to take place as soon as practicable after the
      effective date of the registration statement.

(O)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN,
      ALABAMA , GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for information on EPA litigation. On August 1, 2000, the U.S.
      District Court granted ALABAMA's motion to dismiss for lack of
      jurisdiction in Georgia, and granted SCS's motion to dismiss on the
      grounds that it neither owned nor operated the generating units involved
      in the proceedings.

(P)   Southern Energy has two significant power sales agreements with the
      Philippine National Power Corporation ("NPC") that are supported by a
      sovereign guarantee by the Philippines' government. For the year ended
      December 31, 1999, and the six months ended June 30, 2000, approximately
      8% and 17.5%, respectively, of SOUTHERN's net income was derived from
      these agreements. If these agreements were terminated, it could have a
      material adverse effect on the future operating results and liquidity of
      SOUTHERN and Southern Energy.

(Q)   In March 2000, an administrative  law judge ("ALJ") held hearings
      in connection  with a FERC proceeding to determine the percentage
      of a settled $158.8 million  revenue  requirement  for the period
      from  June  1,  1999  through  December  31,  2001  to be paid to
      Southern  Energy   California,   L.L.C.   and  its   subsidiaries
      (collectively,   "SE  California")  under  reliability   must-run
      agreements  between SE California and the California  Independent
      System Operator ("CAISO"). SE California had proposed to allocate
      approximately  75%  of  the  responsibility  for  payment  of the
      revenue  requirement to the CAISO,  while CAISO and other aligned
      parties  argued that CAISO should pay no more than  approximately
      7%. On June 7, 2000, the ALJ presiding over this FERC  proceeding
      issued an initial  decision  allocating 3% of the  responsibility
      for payment to the CAISO and the remaining 97% to SE  California.
      On July 7,  2000,  SE  California  filed an  appeal  of the ALJ's
      initial  decision  with the FERC.  The  outcome of this appeal is
      uncertain.  A final FERC order in this proceeding may be appealed
      to the U.S.  Court of Appeals.  If SE  California  is  ultimately
      unsuccessful in its appeal of the ALJ's  decision,  SE California
      will  be  required  to  refund  certain  amounts  of the  revenue
      requirement billed to the CAISO for the period from June 1, 1999

                                       69

      until the final disposition of the appeal. The amount of this refund as of
      June 30, 2000 would have been approximately $94 million and would have
      reduced net income by approximately $33 million. These amounts do not
      include interest that would be payable in the event of a refund. If SE
      California is unsuccessful in its appeal, it plans to pursue other options
      available under the reliability must-run agreements to mitigate the impact
      of the ALJ's decision upon its future operations.

(R)   On February 21, 2000, Southern Energy executed a stock purchase agreement
      with The AES Corporation to sell its interest in Alicura for a total
      consideration of $205 million including the assumption of debt. The
      closing was expected to occur on June 28, 2000; however, it has not yet
      occurred. There can be no assurance that this transaction will be
      consummated.

Item 1.          Legal Proceedings.

(1)               Cooper et al.vs. GEORGIA, SOUTHERN and SCS
                  (Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia)

                  On July 28, 2000, a lawsuit alleging race discrimination was
                  filed by three GEORGIA employees against GEORGIA, SOUTHERN and
                  SCS. The lawsuit also raised claims on behalf of a purported
                  class. The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages
                  in an unspecified amount, as well as injunctive relief. The
                  final outcome of this case cannot now be determined.

                  Statements herein for information regarding certain legal and
                  administrative proceedings in which SOUTHERN and its reporting
                  subsidiaries are involved.

                                     BY-LAWS


                Section 1. The annual meeting of the stockholders of the
corporation for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other
corporate business as may properly come before such meeting shall be held at the
corporation's office at Augusta, in the State of Maine, or at such other place
within or without the State of Maine as the Board of Directors may determine, on
the last Tuesday in June in each year; provided, however, that the Board of
Directors may fix an earlier day for such annual meeting of stockholders in any
particular year; and provided further that, if the day fixed for such annual
meeting of stockholders is a legal holiday, such meeting shall be held on the
first day thereafter which is not a legal holiday.

                Section 2. Special meetings of the stockholders of the
corporation may be held at such time and at such place within or without the
State of Maine as may be determined by the President or the Board of Directors
or Executive Committee, or stockholders holding one-fourth of the then
outstanding capital stock entitled to vote.

                Section 3. Notice of the time, place and purpose of every
meeting of stockholders shall be mailed by the Secretary or the officer
performing his duties at least ten days before the meeting to each stockholder
of record entitled to vote, at his post office address as shown by the records
of the corporation, but meetings may be held without notice if all stockholders
entitled to vote are present or if notice is waived before or after the meeting
by those not present. No stockholder shall be entitled to notice of any meeting
of stockholders with respect to any shares registered in his name after the date
upon which notice of such meeting is required by law or by these by-laws to have
been mailed or otherwise given to stockholders.

                Section 4. Subject to the provisions of the articles of
incorporation, as amended, the holders of a majority of the stock of the
corporation entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a
quorum, but less than a quorum shall have power to adjourn.

                At all meetings of stockholders, each stockholder entitled to
vote may vote and otherwise act either in person or by proxy.


<PAGE>


                Section 5. The stock of the corporation shall be transferable or
assignable on the books of the corporation by the holders in person or by
attorney on the surrender of the certificates therefor duly endorsed. The
certificates of stock of the corporation shall be numbered and shall be entered
in the books of the corporation and registered as they are issued. They shall
exhibit the name of the registered holder and shall certify the number of shares
owned by him and shall be signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the
President or a Vice-President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or
the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, and shall be sealed with the corporate
seal of the corporation. Where such certificate is signed by a Transfer Agent or
by a Transfer Clerk acting on behalf of the corporation and by a Registrar, the
signature of any such President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer,
Secretary or Assistant Secretary and the seal of the corporation may be
facsimile. In case any officer or officers who shall have signed, or whose
facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on, any such certificate
or certificates, shall cease to be such officer or officers of the corporation,
whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate or
certificates shall have been delivered by the corporation, such certificate or
certificates may nevertheless be adopted by the corporation and be issued and
delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or
certificates or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used
thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the corporation and the
issuance and delivery of any such certificate or certificates shall be
conclusive evidence of such adoption.

                The stock transfer books of the corporation may be closed by
order of the Board of Directors for such period, not to exceed sixty days
previous to any meeting of the stockholders or previous to the payment of any
dividend upon the stock of the corporation, as the Board may determine, during
which time no transfer of stock upon the books of the Corporation shall be made,
and said books shall be re-opened the day following the date fixed for such
meeting or for the payment of such dividend. If the stock transfer books of the
corporation are ordered closed by the Board of Directors, every stockholder who
appears of record at the time of closing said books shall be entitled to vote at
the meeting or to receive the dividend on account of which the said books were
ordered closed. In lieu of providing for the closing of the stock transfer books
of the corporation, the Board of Directors may fix a date not exceeding sixty
days preceding the date of any meeting of stockholders, or any dividend payment
date, as the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to
notice of and to vote at such meeting, or entitled to receive such dividend, as
the case may be. If the stock transfer books of the corporation are not ordered
closed by the Board of Directors or if the Board of Directors does not fix a
date of record in lieu thereof, every stockholder who appears of record on the
date of a stockholders' meeting shall be entitled to vote at such meeting and
every stockholder who appears of record on the date specified by the Board of
Directors in their declaration of a dividend shall be entitled to such dividend.

                Section 6. Upon receipt by this corporation of evidence,
satisfactory to the Board of Directors, of the loss, destruction or mutilation
of any certificate of stock of this corporation and, if required by the Board of
Directors, upon receipt of indemnity satisfactory to the Board of Directors and
upon surrender and cancellation of such certificate, if mutilated, the Board of
Directors may, if it so determines, direct the officers of this corporation to
execute and deliver a new certificate of like tenor and for the same number of
shares of the same class of stock to be issued in lieu of such lost, destroyed
or mutilated certificate.

                Section 7. The affairs of this corporation shall be managed by a
Board consisting of not less than six directors, nor more than fifteen
directors, their number to be fixed at the annual or any special meeting of the
stockholders, who shall be elected annually by the stockholders entitled to
vote, to hold office until their successors are elected and qualify. Directors
need not be stockholders. A majority of the members of the Board then in office
shall constitute a quorum. Vacancies in the Board of Directors may be filled by
the Board at any meeting, except that vacancies arising from the election of
fewer directors than the total number fixed shall be filled at a meeting of the
stockholders called for the purpose of filling such vacancies, or by the Board
of Directors under special authorization from the stockholders. Any and all of
the directors may at any time be removed without cause assigned by the vote of
the holders of a majority in number of all of the outstanding stock entitled to
vote given at a meeting called for the purpose of considering such action. The
foregoing provisions of this Section 7 relating to the election of directors and
to the filling of vacancies in the Board of Directors shall be subject to the
provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, as amended.

                A person being a full-time executive employee of the corporation
or its parent company or any affiliated company when first elected a director of
the corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to as an "employee-director")
shall not be eligible for election as a director when he ceases to be an
executive employee, whether by reason of resignation, retirement or other cause.
Any employee-director shall resign as a director effective on the date he ceases
to be an executive employee.


<PAGE>


                A person not an employee-director shall not be eligible to serve
as a director of the corporation (1) after his 70th birthday, (2) one year after
permanent separation from the business or professional organization with which
he was primarily associated when first elected a director, (3) one year after
any other material change in his primary occupation or executive position from
that which he pursued or held when first elected a director, or (4) one year
after moving his principal residence outside the service area in which he was a
resident when first elected a director, whichever event first occurs. The
application to an individual of any provision of this paragraph may be waived by
the Board of Directors. Any such waiver shall only be effective on a
year-to-year basis. The provisions of this paragraph, with the exception of item
(1) above, shall apply only to those individuals elected as a member of the
Board of Directors after the annual meeting of this Board held July 26, 1996.

                Any employee-director who is not eligible for election as a
director by reason of the foregoing provisions shall be eligible for election
and re-election by the Board of Directors as an advisory director, upon the
recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation, for a term
ending at the first meeting of the Board of Directors following the annual
meeting of stockholders next following such election. Any person eligible for
election as an advisory director must be one whose services as such will be, in
the opinion of the Board of Directors, of value to the corporation. An advisory
director shall be entitled to notice of and to attend and advise but not to vote
at, meetings of the Board of Directors, and of any committees thereof to which
he shall be appointed, nor shall he be counted in determining the existence of a
quorum, and for his services may be paid, in the discretion of the Board of
Directors, compensation and reimbursement of expenses on the same basis as if he
were a director.

                Section 8. The annual meeting of the Board of Directors shall be
held as soon as practicable after the annual meeting of the stockholders. Other
meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the times fixed by
resolution of the Board or upon call of the Chairman of the Board, the President
or a Vice-President or any person upon whom powers have devolved pursuant to
Section 12 hereof. The Secretary or officer performing his duties shall give at
least two days' notice of all meetings of Directors, provided that a meeting may
be held without notice immediately after the annual election of Directors, and
notice need not be given of regular meetings held at times fixed by resolution
of the Board. Meetings may be held at any time without notice if all the
Directors are present or if those not present waive notice either before or
after the meeting. Notice by mail or telegraph to the usual business or
residence address of the director shall be sufficient. The purpose of special
meetings of the Board of Directors need not be stated in such notice unless
required by law and unless otherwise indicated in the notice any and all
business may be transacted at a special meeting of the Board of Directors.

                Section 9. The Board of Directors, as soon as may be convenient
after the election of directors in each year, may appoint one of their number
Chairman of the Board and shall appoint one of their number President of the
corporation, and shall also appoint one or more Vice-presidents, a Secretary, a
Clerk and a Treasurer, none of whom need be members of the Board, and shall,
from time to time, appoint such other officers as they may deem proper. The same
person may be appointed to more than one office. The term of office of all
officers shall be for one year and until their respective successors are chosen
and qualified, but any officer may be removed from office at any time by the
Board of Directors without cause assigned. Vacancies in the offices shall be
filled by the Board of Directors.

                Section 10. The Board of Directors, as soon as may be after the
election in each year, may appoint an executive committee to consist of the
President and such number of directors as the Board may from time to time
determine. Such committee shall have and may exercise all of the powers of the
Board during the intervals between its meetings which may be lawfully delegated,
subject to such limitations as may be provided by a resolution of the Board. The
Board shall have the power at any time to change the membership of such
committee and to fill vacancies in it. The executive committee may make rules
for the conduct of its business and may appoint such committees and assistants
as it may deem necessary. The Board may, from time to time, determine by
resolution the number of members of such committee required to constitute a
quorum. The Board shall designate the Chairman of the executive committee and
the proceedings of the executive committee shall from time to time be reported
to the Board of Directors.

                Section 11. Unless otherwise designated as separate offices by
the Board of Directors, the President shall be the Chief Executive Officer of
the corporation; he shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and
directors; he shall have general supervision of the business of the corporation;
shall see that all orders and resolutions of the Board are carried into effect,
subject, however, to the rights of the directors to delegate any specific
powers, except such as may be by statute exclusively conferred on the President,
to any other officer of the corporation. He shall, unless otherwise ordered,
execute bonds, deeds, mortgages, and other contracts, and when required shall
cause the seal of the corporation to be affixed thereto and shall sign
certificates of stock. He shall be ex officio a member of all standing
committees, and shall submit to the stockholders at their annual meeting a
report of the year's business. Should the offices of President and Chief
Executive Officer be held by different persons, the above duties shall be as
delegated to each office by the Board of Directors.

                Section 12. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9 hereof,
in the event of the absence or inability of the President to act, the powers and
duties of the President shall, subject to the control of the Board of Directors,
devolve successively upon such other persons as shall have been designated in a
resolution adopted by the Board of Directors, and in accordance with the order
of succession set forth therein.

                Section 13. The Secretary shall attend all sessions of the Board
and record all votes and the minutes of all proceedings in a book to be kept for
that purpose; and shall perform like duties for standing committees when
required. He shall give or cause to be given notice of all meetings of the
stockholders and the Board of Directors, and of standing committees when
required, and shall perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the Board
of Directors or the President under whose supervision he shall act. He shall
keep in safe custody the seal of the Corporation, and when authorized, affix the
same to any instrument requiring a seal, and attest the signatures thereof, when
directed or required to do so.

                Section 14. The Treasurer shall have the custody of the
corporate funds and securities, and shall keep full and accurate accounts of
receipts and disbursements in books belonging to the corporation, and shall
deposit all moneys and other valuable effects in the name and to the credit of
the corporation, in such depositaries as may be designated by the Board of
Directors. He shall disburse the funds of the corporation as may be ordered by
the Board, taking proper vouchers for such disbursements, and shall render to
the President, and to the directors at the regular meetings of the Board or
whenever they may require it, an account of all his transactions as Treasurer
and of the financial condition of the corporation. He shall give the corporation
a bond for the faithful performance of the duties of his office, and for the
restoration to the corporation in case of his death, resignation, retirement or
removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property of
whatever kind, in his possession or under his control belonging to the
corporation.


<PAGE>


                Section 15. It shall be the duty of the Comptroller to supervise
and be responsible for accounting transactions of the corporation; to have
charge of the installation and supervision of all accounting and statistical
records, the preparation of all financial and statistical statements and
reports, and the accounting methods, systems and forms in use by all
departments; he shall perform such other duties as may be assigned to him from
time to time by the President.

                Section 16. One or more Assistant Secretaries or Assistant
Treasurers or Assistant Comptrollers may be elected by the Board or appointed by
the President to hold office until the next annual meeting of the Board of
Directors and until their successors are elected or appointed, but may be
removed at any time. They shall perform any or all of the duties of the
Secretary or Treasurer, or Comptroller as the case may be, and such other duties
as may be assigned to them from time to time.

                Section 17. The Clerk of the corporation shall be a resident of
Maine, and shall be sworn to the faithful performance of his duties. He need not
be a stockholder. He shall keep a full and accurate record of all stockholders'
meetings, shall keep an office in said Augusta as required by law, and shall
have the custody of all books and papers belonging to the corporation which are
located in said office. He shall receive as compensation for his services in
acting as proxy at annual meetings, keeping an office in Maine, preparing
records of annual meetings and furnishing the Secretary with duplicate copies of
same and of necessary blanks and forms at proper times the sum of fifty dollars
annually, payable in advance. He shall receive a reasonable compensation for all
additional services. In the absence of the Clerk, a Clerk pro tempore may be
chosen, who shall be a resident of Maine, and shall be duly sworn.

                Section 18. In the case of the absence of any officer of the
corporation, or for any other reason that the Board may deem sufficient, the
Board may delegate the powers or duties of such officers to any other officer or
to any director, for the time being.

                Section 19. If the office of any director becomes vacant by
reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office,
or otherwise, the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a
quorum, by a majority vote may choose a successor or successors, who shall hold
office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred; but
vacancies in the Board of Directors arising from the election of fewer directors
than the total number fixed shall be filled in the manner prescribed by Section

                Section 20. The Board of Directors shall have power to authorize
the payment of compensation to the directors for services to the corporation,
including fees for attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors, of the
executive committee and all other committees and to determine the amount of such
compensation and fees.

                Section 21.

                A.  Indemnity

                To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall
indemnify each person made, or threatened to be made, a party to any threatened,
pending, or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil or
criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether by or in the right of the
Company or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person, or such person's
testator or intestate, is or was a director, officer or was an employee of the
Company holding one or more management positions through and inclusive of
managers (but not positions below the level of managers) (such positions being
hereinafter referred to as "Management Positions") or is or was serving at the
request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise, in any capacity at the request of the Company, against all
loss and expense actually or reasonably incurred by him including, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, judgments, fines, penalties,
liabilities, sanctions, and amounts paid in settlement and attorneys fees and
disbursements actually and necessarily incurred by him in defense of such action
or proceeding, or any appeal therefrom. The indemnification provided by this
Section shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such person.

                In any case in which a director, officer of the Company or
employee of the Company holding one or more Management Positions requests
indemnification with respect to the defense of any such claim, action, suit or
proceedings, the Company may advance expenses (including attorney's fees)
incurred by such person prior to the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit or proceeding, as authorized by the Board of Directors in the specific
case, upon receipt of a written undertaking by or on behalf of such person to
repay amounts advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such person was
not entitled to be indemnified by the Company under this Section or otherwise;
provided, however, that the advancement of such expenses shall not be deemed to
be indemnification unless and until it shall ultimately be determined that such
person is entitled to be indemnified by the Company. Such a person claiming
indemnification shall be entitled to indemnification upon a determination that
no judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such person has established
that such person's acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active
and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so
adjudicated, or such person personally obtained an economic benefit including a
financial profit or other advantage to which such person was not legally
entitled. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provision, no former,
present or future director or officer of the Company or employee of the Company
holding one or more management positions, or his heirs, executors or
administrators, shall be liable for any undertaking entered into by the Company
or its subsidiaries or affiliates as required by the Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to any rule or regulation of the Securities and Exchange
Commission now or hereafter in effect or orders issued pursuant to the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, or any undertaking
entered into by the Company due to environmental requirements including all
legally enforceable environmental compliance obligations imposed by federal,
state or local statute, regulation, permit, judicial or administrative decree,
order and judgment or other similar means, or any undertaking entered into by
the Company pursuant to any approved Company compliance plan or any federal or
state or municipal ordinance which directly or indirectly regulates the Company,
or its parent by reason of their being holding or investment companies, public
utility companies, public utility holding companies or subsidiaries of public
utility holding companies.

                The foregoing rights shall not be exclusive of any other rights
to which any such director, officer or employee may otherwise be entitled and
shall be available whether or not the director, officer or employee continues to
be a director, officer or employee at the time of incurring any such expenses
and liabilities.

                If any word, clause or provision of the By-laws or any
indemnification made under this Section 21 shall for any reason be determined to
be invalid, the remaining provisions of the By-Laws shall not otherwise be
affected thereby but shall remain in full force and effect. The masculine
pronoun, as used in the By-Laws, means the masculine and feminine wherever
applicable.

                B.  Insurance

                The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person described in Section 21 against any liability or expense (including
attorney fees) which may be asserted against such person whether or not the
Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability or
expense under this Section 21 or otherwise.

                Section 22. The Board of Directors are authorized to select such
depositaries as they shall deem proper for the funds of the corporation. All
checks and drafts against such deposited funds shall be signed by such officers
or such other persons as may be specified by the Board of Directors.

                Section 23. The corporate seal shall be circular in form, and
shall have inscribed thereon the name of the corporation, followed by the word
"Maine" and shall have the word "Seal" inscribed in the center thereof.

                Section 24. A director of this corporation shall not be
disqualified by his office from dealing or contracting with the corporation,
either as vendor, purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any transaction or contract
of this corporation be void or voidable by reason of the fact that any director
or any firm of which any director is a member or any corporation of which any
director is a shareholder or director is in any way interested in such
transaction or shall be authorized, ratified or approved either (a) by vote of a
majority of a quorum of the Board of Directors or the executive committee,
without counting in such majority or quorum any directors so interested or being
a member of a firm so interested or a shareholder or director of a corporation
so interested, or (b) by vote at a stockholders' meeting of the holders of a
majority of all the outstanding shares of the stock of the corporation entitled
to vote or by a writing or writings signed by a majority of such holders; nor
shall any director be liable to account to the corporation for any profit
realized by him from or through any transaction or contract of this corporation
authorized, ratified or approved as aforesaid, by reason of the fact that he or
any firm of which he is a member or any corporation of which he is a shareholder
or director was interested in such transaction or contract. Nothing herein
contained shall create any liability in the events above described or prevent
the authorization, ratification or approval of such contracts or transactions in
any other manner provided by law.

                Section 25. These by-laws may be altered or amended (a) by a
majority vote of the outstanding stock entitled to vote at any annual meeting or
upon notice at any special meeting of stockholders, or (b) at any meeting of the
Board of Directors by a majority vote of the entire Board then in office.

Article are subject to the provisions of the Charter of the Company and/or any

Secretary, or five or more Directors, reasonable notice thereof being given to
each Director by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or officer calling the

present, or those not present have waived notice thereof in writing. Such
special meetings shall be held at such times and places as the notice thereof or
waiver shall specify.

becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or
otherwise, the remaining Directors, although less than a quorum, may, by a
majority vote, choose a successor or successors who shall hold office for the
unexpired term, but vacancies in the Board of Directors may be filled for the
unexpired term by the Stockholders at a meeting called for that purpose, unless
such vacancy shall have been filled by the Directors. The provisions of this
Article are subject to the provisions of the Charter of the Company and/or any
resolution of the Stockholders setting forth the powers, preferences, etc., of
the various classes of stock of the Company.

                                  ARTICLE XXIV

                                  Capital Stock

         The amount of capital stock shall be as fixed in the Charter of this
Corporation or as the same may be increased or decreased from time to time in
accordance with the provisions of law.

                                   ARTICLE XXV

                              Certificates of Stock

         Every Stockholder shall be entitled to a certificate or certificates of
stock of the Company in form prescribed by the Board of Directors, duly numbered
and sealed with the corporate seal of the Company, and setting forth the number
and kind of shares represented thereby to which each Stockholder is entitled.
Such certificates shall be signed by the President or a Vice President and by
the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary of the Company. The Board of Directors may also appoint one or more
Transfer Agents and/or Registrars for its stock of any class or classes and may
require stock certificates to be counter-signed and/or registered by one or more
of such Transfer Agents and/or Registrars. If certificates of capital stock of
the Company are signed by a Transfer Agent or by a Registrar, the signature of
the officers of the Company and the seal of the Company thereon may be
facsimiles, engraved, printed or otherwise reproduced. Any provisions of these
Bylaws with reference to the signing and sealing of stock certificates shall
include, in cases above permitted, such facsimiles. In case any officer or
officers who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall
have been used on, any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such
officer or officers of the Company, whether because of death, resignation or
otherwise, before such certificate or certificates shall have been delivered by
the Company, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be adopted by the
Board of Directors of the Company and be issued and delivered as though the
person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile
signature or signatures shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such
officer or officers of the Company.

                                  ARTICLE XXVI

                                Transfer of Stock

         Shares of stock may be transferred by delivery of the certificate,
accompanied either by an assignment in writing on the back of the certificate,
or by a written power of attorney to sell, assign and transfer the same, signed
by the owner of the certificate. No transfer shall affect the right of the
Corporation to pay any dividend due upon the stock, or to treat the holder of
record as the holder in fact until such transfer is recorded upon the books of
the Corporation or a new certificate is issued to the person to whom it has been
so transferred. It shall be the duty of every Stockholder to notify the
Corporation of his post office address.

                                  ARTICLE XXVII

                                  Record Dates

         The Board of Directors or the Executive Committee may fix in advance
(a) a date, not less than ten (10) nor more than forty-five (45) days preceding
the date of any meeting of the Stockholders, as a record date for the
determination of Stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any such
meeting or any adjournment thereof; (b) a date, not less than ten (10) nor more
than thirty (30) days prior to the date for the payment of any dividend, or
other distribution, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when
any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock (including any exchange of
stock upon a merger, consolidation or sale of all, or substantially all, of the
assets of the Corporation) shall go into effect, as a record date for the
determination of the Stockholders entitled to receive payment of any such
dividend, or distribution, or to any such allotment of rights, or to exercise
the rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock, as
the case may be; and (c) a date, not less than ten (10) nor more than forty-five
(45) days preceding the date for the taking of any other lawful corporate action
not covered by the foregoing, as a record date for the determination of
Stockholders entitled to act thereon and/or receive the benefit thereof;
notwithstanding, in any such case, any transfer of any stock on the books of the
Corporation after any such record date fixed as aforesaid.

                                 ARTICLE XXVIII

                              Loss of Certificates

         In case of the loss, mutilation or destruction of a certificate of
stock, a duplicate certificate may be issued therefor upon such terms as the
Board of Directors shall prescribe.

                                  ARTICLE XXIX

                                      Seal

         The seal of this Corporation shall consist of a flat faced circular die
with the words and figures "Savannah Electric and Power Company Corporate Seal
1921 Georgia" cut or engraved thereon.

                                   ARTICLE XXX

                  Facsimile Signatures on Bonds and Debentures

         The signatures of any officer of this Corporation executing a corporate
bond, debenture or other debt security of the Corporation or attesting the
corporate seal thereon, or upon any interest coupons annexed to any such
corporate bond, debenture or other debt security of the Corporation, and the
corporate seal affixed to any such bond, debenture or other debt security of the
Corporation, may be facsimiles, engraved or printed, provided that such bond,
debenture or other debt security of the Corporation is authenticated or
countersigned with the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
corporate trustee designated by the indenture or other agreement under which
said security is issued or of an authenticating agent appointed by such
corporate trustee to act in its behalf or by a transfer agent, or registered by
a registrar, other than the Corporation itself or an employee of the
Corporation. In case any officer or officers whose signature or signatures,
whether manual or facsimile, shall have been used on any corporate bond,
debenture or other debt security shall cease to be an officer or officers of the
Corporation for any reason before the same has been delivered by the
Corporation, such bond, debenture or other debt security may nevertheless be
issued and delivered as though the person or persons whose signatures were used
thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers.

                                  ARTICLE XXXI

                       Indemnification and Related Matters

             Each person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation
or is or was an employee of the Corporation holding one or more positions of
management through and inclusive of department managers (but not positions below
the level of department managers) (such positions being hereinafter referred to
as "Management Positions") and who was or is a party or was or is threatened to
be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason
of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or
was an employee of the Corporation holding one or more Management Positions, or
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee, agent or trustee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall be indemnified by the
Corporation as a matter of right against any and all expenses (including
attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him and against any and all
claims, judgments, fines, penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
actually incurred by him in defense of such claim, action, suit or proceeding,
including appeals, to the full extent permitted by applicable law. The
indemnification provided by this Article shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

         Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a director or officer
of the Corporation or employee of the Corporation holding one or more Management
Positions with respect to the defense of any such claim, action, suit or
proceeding may be advanced by the Corporation prior to the final disposition of
such claim, action, suit or proceeding, as authorized by the Board of Directors
in the specific case, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
person to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that such
person is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under this Article or
otherwise; provided, however, that the advancement of such expenses shall not be
deemed to be indemnification unless and until it shall ultimately be determined
that such person is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation.

         The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance at the expense of
the Corporation on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee, or agent of the Corporation, or any person who is or was serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director (or the equivalent), officer,
employee, agent or trustee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability or
expense (including attorneys' fees) asserted against him and incurred by him in
any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability or
expense under this Article or otherwise.

           Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, no
present or future director or officer of the Corporation, or employee of the
Corporation holding one or more Management Positions, or his heirs, executors,
or administrators, shall be liable for any act, omission, step, or conduct taken
or had in good faith, or for any undertaking entered into by the Corporation or
its subsidiaries or affiliates which is required, authorized, or approved by any
order or orders issued pursuant to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, the Federal Power Act, or any undertaking entered into by the Corporation
due to environmental requirements including all legally enforceable
environmental compliance obligations imposed by federal, state or local statute,
regulation, permit, judicial or administrative decree, order and judgment or
other similar means, or any undertaking entered into by the Corporation pursuant
to any approved compliance plan, or any federal or state statute or municipal
ordinance regulating the Corporation or its parent by reason of their being
holding or investment companies, public utility companies, public utility
holding companies, or subsidiaries of public utility holding companies. In any
action, suit, or proceeding based on any act, omission, step, or conduct, as in
this paragraph described, the provisions hereof shall be brought to the
attention of the court. In the event that the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph are found by the court not to constitute a valid defense on the
grounds of not being applicable to the particular class of plaintiff, each such
director and officer, or employee holding a Management Position, and his heirs,
executors, and administrators, shall be reimbursed for, or indemnified against,
all expenses and liabilities incurred by him or imposed on him, in connection
with, or arising out of, any such action, suit, or proceeding based on any act,
omission, step, or conduct taken or had in good faith as in this paragraph
described. Such expenses and liabilities shall include, but shall not be limited
to, judgments, court costs, and attorneys' fees.

         The foregoing rights shall not be exclusive of any other rights to
which any such director or officer or employee may otherwise be entitled and
shall be available whether or not the director or officer or employee continues
to be a director or officer or employee at the time of incurring any such
expenses and liabilities.

         If any word, clause or provision of the Bylaws or any indemnification
made under this Article shall for any reason be determined to be invalid, the
provisions of the Bylaws shall not otherwise be affected thereby but shall
remain in full force and effect. The masculine pronoun, as used in the Bylaws,
means the masculine and feminine wherever applicable.

                                  ARTICLE XXXII

                                   Amendments

                  The By-laws of the Company may be altered, amended or repealed
(a) at any meeting of the Board of Directors by the vote of a majority of the
entire Board then in office, or (b) by the vote of the holders of a majority of
that part of the capital stock of the Company having voting powers which is
represented in person or by proxy at any annual meeting of stockholders or at
any special meeting called for that purpose (provided that a lawful quorum of
stockholders be there represented in person or by proxy), or (c) without a
meeting by the written consent of the holders of all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company having voting powers; provided,
however, that the Board of Directors shall not have power to alter, amend or
repeal the provisions of Article VII or Article XXXI of the By-laws and
provided, further, that an alteration, amendment or repeal of any other
provision of the By-laws by the Board of Directors shall cease to be effective
unless submitted to and ratified or approved at the next annual or special
meeting at which a lawful quorum of stockholders is represented in person or by
proxy by the vote of the holders of a majority of that part of the capital stock
of the Company having voting powers which is represented in person or by proxy
at such meeting
