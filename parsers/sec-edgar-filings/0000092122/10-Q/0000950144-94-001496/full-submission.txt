                 THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
             MANAGEMENT'S OPINION AS TO FAIR STATEMENT OF RESULTS

    The condensed financial statements of SOUTHERN included herein have been
prepared by SOUTHERN, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the SEC.  In the opinion of SOUTHERN's management, subject to the effect of
such adjustments, if any, as might have been required had the outcome of the
uncertainty with respect to the actions of the regulators regarding the
recoverability of GEORGIA's investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped storage
hydroelectric project, as more fully discussed in Note (G) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein, been known, the information furnished herein
reflects all adjustments (which, except for the provision for separation
benefits recorded in 1994, included only normal recurring adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the results for the periods ended June 30, 1994 and
1993.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations, although SOUTHERN believes that the disclosures are adequate to
make the information presented not misleading.  It is suggested that these
condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and the notes thereto included in SOUTHERN's latest annual report on
Form 10-K and, with  respect to nuclear decommissioning, the March 31, 1994
quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

                 THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS
SOUTHERN's earnings for the second quarter of 1994 were slightly higher than
earnings recorded in the same period of 1993 primarily because of lower capital
costs.  Consolidated net income was $256 million for the second quarter of
1994, compared to $250 million for the second quarter of 1993.  Earnings per
share were $0.39 in the second quarter of both 1994 and 1993.  Also, refer to
"Other Income" later in this discussion for details of the gains recorded from
the sales of a portion of Plant Scherer Unit 4 in June of 1993 and 1994.

REVENUES
Retail energy sales increased 4.0% primarily because of an increase in the
number of customers served and the improvement in the economy.  Energy sales to
residential, commercial and industrial customers increased 3.8%, 6.5% and 2.5%,
respectively.  Wholesale energy sales decreased 41.6% due to reduced demand and
scheduled reductions in off-system contracts.  As a result, total energy sales
decreased 4.9%.  Capacity revenues for the second quarter of 1994 were $20
million less than in the second quarter of 1993.  The capacity revenues
decreased as scheduled, coinciding with GEORGIA completing the second and third
sales of a portion of Plant Scherer Unit 4 in June 1993 and 1994.  The final
sale in a series of four transactions for the sale of this generating unit is
scheduled for June 1995.  The generation from this unit has been dedicated to
unit power sales.

EXPENSES
Fuel expense for the second quarter of 1994, compared to the corresponding
period of 1993, was lower due primarily to a decrease in the average cost of
coal.  Purchased power expense decreased because of the reduction in capacity
buyback payments by GEORGIA to the co-owners of plants Vogtle and Scherer and
lower demand from wholesale customers.  See Note (F) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for information regarding the Georgia PSC's retail rate order
that required the levelization of capacity buyback expense for Plant Vogtle.

    The Southern electric system has instituted a number of initiatives to curb
the growth of expenses, including workforce reduction programs.  Disregarding
the one-time cost of these programs, they are projected to yield pre-tax
savings of approximately $26 million in 1994 and approximately $51 million in
each succeeding year.  See Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for further information on these programs.  Maintenance expenses
decreased due to the timing of scheduled maintenance on generating units.

    Taxes other than income taxes were higher primarily because of increased
investment in plant.  The increase in income tax expense was due to higher
earnings and the enactment of a federal income tax rate increase in August
1993.

                 THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

    The settlement of an IRS audit for the tax years 1983 through 1987 in May
1993 resulted in an increase in depreciation and amortization in the second
quarter of 1993 due to the reversal of the amortization of certain investment
tax credits.  The settlement also resulted in interest charges and a reduction
in tax expense applicable to other income due to the recognition of tax credits
previously deferred.  While the settlement resulted in the payment of
additional taxes during the second quarter of 1993, there was no material
effect on net income.

INTEREST CHARGES AND DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED STOCK
The decrease in interest on long-term debt and dividends on preferred stock
reflects the SOUTHERN system's efforts to decrease its capital costs.  In
response to the low interest rate levels prevailing during 1992 and 1993, the
SOUTHERN system refinanced a significant portion of its long-term debt and
preferred stock.  To the extent it is economically feasible, efforts to reduce
capital costs will continue.  Other interest charges for the second quarter of
1993 reflect the accrual of interest on the settlement of an IRS audit in May
1993.

OTHER INCOME
On June 1 of 1993 and 1994, GEORGIA completed the second and third sales in a
series of four separate transactions to sell Plant Scherer Unit 4.  The second
sale for 31.44% of the unit was made for $253 million and resulted in a pre-tax
gain of $35.1 million ($18.4 million, after taxes).  The latter sale for 16.55%
of the unit was made for $133 million and resulted in a pre-tax gain of $21.7
million ($11.3 million, after taxes).  Additionally, income taxes applicable to
other income in the second quarter of 1993 were reduced as a result of the tax
effect of the interest charges in the settlement of an IRS audit and the
recognition of tax credits previously deferred.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction and not included in rate base.  The equity portion represents
non-cash income.  However, when facilities are completed and included in rate
base, previously capitalized amounts significantly increase cash flow because
revenues are higher as a result of the increased rate base and additional
depreciation expense.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings is contingent upon
numerous factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.

filed against GULF related to fuel transportation; the outcome of a proceeding
initiated by the FERC to determine the appropriate return on equity on
wholesale power and transmission contracts; and complaints filed by MEAG and
OPC seeking to recover from GEORGIA an aggregate of $22.8 million (including
interest) in alleged partial requirements rates overcharges.

    Pursuant to an Integrated Resource Plan approved by the Georgia PSC,
GEORGIA has implemented various demand-side option programs and had been
authorized by the Georgia PSC to recover associated program costs through rate
riders.  A superior court judge s ruling that recovery of these costs through
rate riders was unlawful was reversed by the Georgia Court of Appeals in July
1994.  GEORGIA has ceased collection of the rate riders and the Georgia PSC has
allowed the deferral of program costs pending the final outcome of this matter.
For additional information on this matter, see Note (H) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein.

    The IRS has notified SOUTHERN that its tax accounting for the sale by
GEORGIA of a portion of Plant Vogtle in 1984 was improper.  The potential tax
deficiency and interest arising from this issue amount to approximately $30
million and $33 million, respectively.  The tax deficiency relates to a timing
issue as to when taxes are paid, therefore only the interest could impact
future income.  See Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
further discussion of this matter.

    Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
increased costs cannot be offset.  The Clean Air Act is discussed under
"Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
SOUTHERN's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Also see Note (M) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for information regarding a list of sites,
including a number of sites owned by GEORGIA, compiled by the State of Georgia
that may require environmental remediation.

    Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, and the rate of economic growth in SOUTHERN's service area.  The
enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the electric utility
industry.  A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy Act and
particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SOUTHERN's 1993
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition,
measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating
stations in financial statements.  In response to these questions, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board has decided to review the accounting for
nuclear decommissioning.  If current electric utility industry accounting
practices for such decommissioning costs are changed: (1)

annual provisions for decommissioning could increase and (2) the total
estimated cost for decommissioning may be required to be recorded as a
liability on the balance sheet.  ALABAMA and GEORGIA do not believe that such
changes, if required, would have a significant adverse effect on results of
operations due to their current and expected future ability to recover
decommissioning costs through rates.  Further discussion of nuclear
decommissioning costs is made in Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first half of
1994 were the addition of approximately $696 million to utility plant, the
commercial operation of seven combustion turbine generating units having an
aggregate nameplate capacity of approximately 635 megawatts, the sale of a
portion of Plant Scherer Unit 4, recognition of the liability associated with
the implementation of workforce reduction programs and the sale of SOUTHERN's
common stock for $122 million.  The funds for gross property additions and
other capital requirements were derived primarily from operations, the sale of
a portion of Plant Scherer, an increase in other long-term debt and security
sales.  See SOUTHERN's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.
Additionally, SOUTHERN's board of directors declared a two-for-one common
stock split in the form of a stock distribution for each share issued and
outstanding as of February 7, 1994.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE
One of SOUTHERN's goals is to maintain common equity as a percent of total
capitalization, including short-term debt and the current portion of
capitalization, within a range of 40 to 45%.  This ratio was 43.7% at June 30,
1994, compared to 43.8% at December 31, 1993.  The market price of SOUTHERN's
common stock at June 30, 1994, was $18.75 per share, compared to a book value
of $12.06.  This represents a market-to-book value ratio of 155%.  The
quarterly dividend for the second quarter of 1994 was 29.5 cents per share.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION
The construction program of the Southern electric system is budgeted at $4.3
billion for the three years 1994 through 1996 ($1.5 billion in 1994, $1.3
billion in 1995 and $1.5 billion in 1996). Actual construction costs may vary
from this estimate because of such factors as changes in business conditions;
changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulations; changes in environmental
regulations; revised load growth projections; increasing costs of labor,
equipment and materials; and the cost of capital.

    Current energy demand forecasts do not require any additional baseload
generating facilities until well into the future.  However, the construction of
combustion turbine peaking units of approximately 1,700 megawatts is planned by
1996, including those that began commercial operation in 1994, to

FINANCIAL CONDITION  (Continued)

meet the increased peak-hour demands.  In addition, significant construction
will continue related to transmission and distribution facilities and the
upgrading and extension of the useful lives of generating plants.  GEORGIA and
OPC have entered into a joint ownership agreement for the latter to assume
responsibility for the construction and completion of the Rocky Mountain
project.  This agreement is described further in Note 4 to the financial
statements in Item 8 of SOUTHERN's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the
Southern electric system's capital requirements and operating costs.  The acid
rain compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will have a significant impact
on the Southern electric system.  This legislation, as well as other
legislation and regulations, are described under "Environmental Matters" in
Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SOUTHERN's 1993 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.  The full impact of these requirements cannot be determined at
this time, pending the development and implementation of applicable
regulations.

OTHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
In addition to the funds needed for the construction program, approximately $86
million, excluding those funds on deposit with trustees and which are
specifically designated for called redemptions, will be required by June 30,
1995, for present sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt
and preferred stock.  Also, the operating subsidiaries plan to continue, to the
extent possible, a program to retire high-cost debt and preferred stock and
replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

SOURCES OF FUNDS
In addition to the sale of common stock in the first half of 1994, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year.  The
amounts and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 1994, as well
as in subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment
opportunities.  The operating subsidiaries plan to obtain the funds required
for construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the
past.  However, the type and timing of financings will depend on market
conditions, maintenance of adequate earnings, and regulatory approval.
Additionally, GEORGIA expects to receive approximately $130 million in 1995
from the sale of its remaining ownership interest in Plant Scherer Unit 4.
These property sales are discussed further in Note 7 to the financial
statements in Item 8 in SOUTHERN's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
June 30, 1994, approximately $205 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $1.2 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks.

    At June 30, 1994, the system companies had outstanding $622 million of
notes payable and $310 million of commercial paper.  The level of short-term
indebtedness is seasonal and by the conclusion

of summer such levels of short-term debt should be greatly pared.  The
short-term lines of credit may not be utilized in their entirety without
additional regulatory approval.  Since the construction program with respect to
major generating projects has been completed, management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

    In order to issue additional long-term debt and preferred stock, the
operating subsidiaries must comply with certain earnings coverage requirements
outlined in their respective mortgage indentures and corporate charters.  The
coverage ratios of SOUTHERN's operating subsidiaries are sufficiently high to
permit, at present interest rate levels, any foreseeable security sales.  The
amount of securities which they will be permitted to issue in the future will
depend upon market conditions and other factors prevailing at that time.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
                                       
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ALABAMA's financial performance during the second quarter of 1994 improved,
compared to the same period of 1993, due primarily to higher retail revenues
and lower financing costs.  Net income after dividends on preferred stock was
$98.7 million during the second quarter of 1994, compared to $91.4 million in
the corresponding period of 1993.

REVENUES
Operating revenues in the second quarter of 1994 increased over the
corresponding period of 1993 due to higher energy sales to retail customers.
The 4.6% increase in retail energy sales is attributable primarily to an
increase in customers served, weather and the improving economy in Alabama.
Revenues from non-affiliated wholesale customers also increased, including a
$6.6 million increase in capacity revenues.  Total energy sales increased 3.4%.

    Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company.  These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

EXPENSES
Fuel expense increased because of a 12.5% increase in coal-fired generation.
Coal-fired generation increased due to greater demand and lower nuclear
generation.  ALABAMA accrues estimated operation and maintenance expenses
related to nuclear refueling outages during the period between outages.  During
the second quarter of 1994, ALABAMA reduced the accrual to reflect actual
incurred costs.  As a result, both other operation expenses and maintenance
expenses were lower than the amounts recorded in the second quarter of 1993.
The increase in depreciation and amortization reflects the additions to utility
plant.

    Taxes other than income taxes increased because of higher revenues and the
addition of new facilities.  The increase in income tax expense reflected the
improvement in earnings and an increase in the federal income tax rate enacted
in August 1993.

OTHER INCOME AND ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
The change in "Other, net" is primarily attributable to increases in
contributions to non-profit organizations.  AFUDC represents the estimated debt
and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the
construction of new facilities.  While cash is not realized currently from such
allowance, it is realized over the service life of the plant through increased
revenues resulting from a higher rate base and higher depreciation expense.

INTEREST CHARGES AND DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED STOCK
The decrease in interest on long-term debt and dividends on preferred stock
reflects ALABAMA's efforts to decrease its capital costs.  ALABAMA, in response
to the low interest rate levels prevailing

during 1992 and 1993, refinanced a significant portion of its long-term debt
and preferred stock.  Other interest charges for the second quarter of 1993
include interest accrued on the settlement of the IRS audit for the years 1983
through 1987.  The settlement of this audit had minimal impact on earnings.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.

    Discussed in the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein are
certain regulatory and legal proceedings that may impact ALABAMA's future
earnings.  The issues include a civil suit related to financing agreements and
proceedings concerning the reasonableness of the Southern electric system's
wholesale rate schedules and contracts.

    Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
cost increases cannot be offset.  The Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues are discussed under "Environmental Issues" in Item 7 - Management's
Discussion and Analysis in ALABAMA's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    Future earnings will also depend upon growth in electric sales which are
subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors have included
changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced
by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather, competition, and the rate of
economic growth in ALABAMA's service area.  The enactment of the Energy Act
will have a profound effect on the future of the electric utility industry.  A
discussion of the potential impact of the Energy Act and particularly its
effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 -
Management's Discussion and Analysis in ALABAMA's 1993 Annual Report on Form
10-K.

      The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition,
measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating
stations in financial statements.  In response to these questions, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board has decided to review the accounting for
nuclear decommissioning.  If current electric utility industry accounting
practices for such decommissioning costs are changed: (1) annual provisions for
decommissioning could increase and (2) the total estimated cost for
decommissioning may be required to be recorded as a liability on the balance
sheet.  ALABAMA does not believe that such changes, if required, would have a
significant adverse effect on results of operations due to its current and
expected future ability to recover decommissioning costs through

rates.  Further discussion of nuclear decommissioning costs is made in Note (C)
to the Condensed Financial Statements herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The principal change in ALABAMA's financial condition in the first six months
of 1994 was gross property additions of $218 million to utility plant.  The
funds for gross property additions were derived from operating activities and
an increase in short-term debt.  See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash
Flows herein for further details.

    During the first six months of 1994, ALABAMA refinanced $78.1 million of
pollution control bonds.  ALABAMA's common equity as a percent of total
capitalization was 47.7% at June 30, 1994, compared to 47.4% at year-end 1993.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
ALABAMA has regulatory approval for short-term borrowings of up to $450
million.  At June 30, 1994, ALABAMA had outstanding $161 million of commercial
paper and $22 million of notes payable and had $539 million of committed lines
of credit available.

   Capital expenditures are estimated to total $1.7 billion for the three years
1994 through 1996 ($588 million in 1994, $572 million in 1995 and $531 million
in 1996).  Current energy demand forecasts do not require any additional
baseload generating facilities until well into the future.  However, the
construction of combustion turbine peaking units of approximately 720 megawatts
of capacity is planned by 1996 to meet increased peak-hour demands.  In
addition, significant construction of transmission and distribution facilities
and upgrading of generating plants will continue.

    The capital budget is subject to periodic review and revision and capital
costs incurred may vary from estimates because of several factors, including
changes in business conditions; revised load growth projections; changes in
environmental regulations; changes in existing nuclear plant to meet new
regulatory requirements; increasing costs of labor, equipment and materials;
and the cost of capital.

   In addition to the funds needed for the capital budget, approximately $101.8
million will be required by June 30, 1995, for debt maturities.  This amount
includes $53.7 million for pollution control bonds that have been refinanced.
The funds for these redemptions are on deposit with the Trustee and are
specifically designated for only that purpose.  Also, ALABAMA plans to continue
to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these obligations
with lower-cost capital.

FINANCIAL CONDITION (Continued)

    It is anticipated that the funds required will be derived from sources
similar to those used in the past.  In order to issue additional first mortgage
bonds and preferred stock, ALABAMA must comply with certain earnings coverage
requirements contained in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter.
ALABAMA's coverages are at a level that would permit necessary amounts of
security sales at current interest and dividend rates.

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS





TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

    We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of June 30, 1994, and the related condensed statements of income for
the three-month, six-month and twelve-month periods ended June 30, 1994 and
1993, and condensed statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended
June 30, 1994 and 1993.  These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management.

    We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of
which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken
as a whole.  Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

    Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

   We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1993
(not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 16, 1994, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement.  In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                             GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
             MANAGEMENT'S OPINION AS TO FAIR STATEMENT OF RESULTS


      The condensed financial statements of GEORGIA included herein have been
prepared by GEORGIA, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the SEC.  As more fully discussed in Note (G) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein, an uncertainty exists with respect to the actions of the
regulators regarding the recoverability of GEORGIA's investment in the Rocky
Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project.  In the opinion of GEORGIA's
management, subject to the effect of such adjustments, if any, as might have
been required had the outcome of the uncertainty been known, the information
regarding GEORGIA furnished herein reflects all adjustments (which, except for
the provision for separation benefits recorded in 1994, included only normal
recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results for the periods
ended June 30, 1994 and 1993. Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC
rules and regulations, although GEORGIA believes that the disclosures regarding
GEORGIA are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  It is
suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and the notes thereto included in GEORGIA's latest
annual report on Form 10-K and, with respect to nuclear decommissioning, the 
March 31, 1994 quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

    The condensed financial statements of GEORGIA included herein have been
reviewed by GEORGIA's independent public accountants as set forth in their
report included herein as Exhibit 1.

                             GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS
GEORGIA's earnings for the second quarter of 1994 declined slightly compared to
the corresponding quarter of 1993.  Net income after dividends on preferred
stock was $139.4 million in the second quarter of 1994 and $141.2 million in
the second quarter of 1993.  The decline is due primarily to the gain recorded
from the sale of Plant Scherer Unit 4 in June of 1993, partially offset by
lower financing costs.  See "Other Income" later in this discussion for further
details.

REVENUES
Total operating revenues decreased compared to the second quarter of 1993
because of the decrease in energy sales to non-affiliated wholesale customers
and the impact of a new rate tariff for territorial wholesale customers.
Excluding fuel clause revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses and do not affect income, operating revenues for the second quarter of
1994 decreased $10.1 million, compared to the corresponding period of 1993.

    Retail - Retail energy sales for the second quarter of 1994 increased 3.1%
primarily because of continued improvement in Georgia's economy and an increase
in customers served.  Residential, commercial and industrial energy sales
increased 0.1%, 5.3% and 3.3%, respectively.  Total non-fuel retail revenues
increased $11.3 million.

    Wholesale - Energy sales to non-affiliated wholesale customers for the
second quarter of 1994 decreased almost 70%, compared to the corresponding
period of 1993.  Capacity revenues from non-affiliated utilities outside the
service area, which do affect earnings, were down $25.2 million.  These
capacity revenues decreased as scheduled, coinciding with GEORGIA completing
the second and third sales in a series of four transactions for the sale of
Plant Scherer Unit 4 in June of 1993 and 1994.  The final transaction for the
sale of this unit is scheduled for June 1995 and coincides with scheduled
reductions in capacity revenues of approximately $19 million in 1995.  Energy
revenues from non-affiliated utilities outside the service area decreased $12
million.  The energy component of contract sales is priced at approximately the
variable production cost and does not materially affect earnings.  

    Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric 
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period 
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at 
each company.  These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

OPERATING EXPENSES
Fuel and Purchased Power - Fuel expense decreased primarily because of lower
generation and the displacement of coal-fired generation with lower cost
nuclear generation.  Purchased power expense for the second quarter of 1994
decreased primarily due to scheduled reductions

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

in capacity buyback payments to the co-owners of plants Vogtle and Scherer and,
as discussed earlier, due to a new rate tariff for territorial wholesale
customers which also resulted in decreased purchased power from these
customers.  See Note (F) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the levelization of capacity buyback expense for Plant
Vogtle.  In addition, GEORGIA purchased less energy from affiliated companies
because of lower wholesale energy demands.

   Other - Other operation and maintenance expenses remained relatively
constant compared to the second quarter of 1993.  See Note (K) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for information regarding workforce reduction
programs instituted in the first quarter of 1994 by GEORGIA and SCS.

   The decrease in depreciation and amortization is due to the settlement of an
IRS audit in May 1993.  The settlement resulted in an increase in depreciation
and amortization in the second quarter of 1993 due to the reversal of the
amortization of certain investment tax credits.  The settlement also resulted
in interest charges and a reduction in tax expense applicable to other income
due to the recognition of tax credits previously deferred.  While the
settlement resulted in GEORGIA paying additional taxes during the second
quarter of 1993, there was no effect on net income.

On June 1 of 1993 and 1994, GEORGIA completed the second and third sales in a
series of four separate transactions to sell Plant Scherer Unit 4.  The 1993
sale for 31.44% of the unit was made for $253 million and resulted in a pre-tax
gain of $35.1 million ($18.4 million, after taxes).  The 1994 sale for 16.55%
of the unit was made for $133 million and resulted in a pre-tax gain of $21.7
million ($11.3 million, after taxes).  Income taxes applicable to other income
in the second quarter of 1993 were reduced as a result of the tax effect of the
interest charges in the IRS settlement and the recognition of tax credits
previously deferred.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction and is included in rate base.  The equity portion of AFUDC
represents non-cash income.  The amount of AFUDC has increased because of
GEORGIA's increased investment in the construction of combustion turbine
peaking units scheduled for completion in 1994 and 1995.  Four of these units
began commercial operation in 1994.  Based upon GEORGIA's construction budget,
AFUDC is estimated to total $19 million in 1994 and $27 million in 1995.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

INTEREST CHARGES AND DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED STOCK
Interest charges and preferred stock dividends have declined due to refinancing
efforts over the past twelve months.  Also, GEORGIA used the proceeds from the
Plant Scherer sales in 1993 and 1994 to redeem high cost securities.  As
discussed earlier, the higher amount of other interest charges in the second
quarter of 1993 was due to the interest charges incurred from the settlement of
the IRS audit.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings.  The level of future earnings is contingent upon numerous
factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.  Growth in
energy sales is subject to a number of factors which traditionally have
included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation
practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather, competition, and the
rate of economic growth in GEORGIA s service area.

    Pursuant to an Integrated Resource Plan approved by the Georgia PSC,
GEORGIA has implemented various demand-side option programs and had been
authorized by the Georgia PSC to recover associated program costs through rate
riders.  In October 1993, a superior court judge ruled that recovery of these
costs through rate riders was unlawful.  GEORGIA ceased collection of the rate
riders and the Georgia PSC allowed the deferral of program costs pending the
final outcome of this matter.  In July 1994, the Georgia Court of Appeals
reversed the lower court's ruling concerning the rate riders.  For additional
information on this matter, see Note (H) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein.

    The IRS has notified SOUTHERN that its tax accounting for the sale by
GEORGIA of a portion of Plant Vogtle in 1984 was improper.  The potential tax
deficiency and interest arising from this issue amount to approximately $30
million and $33 million, respectively.  The tax deficiency relates to a timing
issue as to when taxes are paid, therefore only the interest could impact
future income.  See Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
further discussion of this matter.

    In compliance with the recently enacted Georgia Hazardous Site Response
Act, the State of Georgia was required to compile an inventory of all sites
where hazardous wastes, constituents or substances have been disposed or
released in quantities deemed reportable by the State.  In developing this
list, the State of Georgia identified several hundred properties throughout the
State, including 23 sites which may require environmental remediation by
GEORGIA.  If all sites were required to be remediated, GEORGIA could incur
expenses of up to $25 million in additional clean-up costs and construction
expenditures of up to $100 million.  See Note (M) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for further information on this matter.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

    The addition of new peaking capacity in 1994 and 1995, as well as the Rocky
Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project in 1995, will result in increased
operation, maintenance and depreciation expense.  GEORGIA is scheduled to sell
its remaining ownership interest (16.55%) in Plant Scherer Unit 4 to Florida
Power & Light and the Jacksonville Electric Authority in June 1995.  This
transaction will generate approximately $130 million in cash, including an
estimated after-tax gain of approximately $10 million.  This transaction
coincides with scheduled reductions in capacity sales to these utilities under
wholesale power contracts.

    OPC and MEAG have filed joint complaints in two separate venues seeking to
recover from GEORGIA approximately $16.5 million in alleged overcharges, plus
approximately $6.3 million in interest.  See Note (L) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for further discussion of this matter.

    The enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the future
of the electric utility industry.  A discussion of the potential impact of the
Energy Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future
Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis in GEORGIA
s 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    The FERC has initiated a proceeding concerning the equity returns on
wholesale power and transmission contracts.  Management does not believe that
the final outcome of this proceeding will have a material adverse effect on
earnings.  See Note 3 to GEORGIA's financial statements in Item 8 to GEORGIA s
1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on this proceeding.

    As described in Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein,
GEORGIA faces an uncertainty with respect to the actions of regulators
regarding the recovery of GEORGIA's investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped
storage hydroelectric project.

    The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition,
measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating
stations in financial statements.  In response to these questions, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board has decided to review the accounting for
nuclear decommissioning.  If current electric utility industry practices for
such decommissioning costs are changed: (1) annual provisions for
decommissioning could increase and (2) the total estimated cost for
decommissioning may be required to be recorded as a liability on the balance
sheet.  GEORGIA does not believe that such changes, if required, would have a
significant adverse effect on results of operations due to its current and
expected future ability to recover decommissioning costs through rates.
Further discussion of nuclear decommissioning costs is made in Note (C) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The principal changes in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first six
months of 1994 were additions of $284 million to utility plant, the commercial
operation of four 80-megawatt combustion turbine peaking units, the sale of a
portion of Plant Scherer Unit 4 and recognition of the liability associated
with the implementation of workforce reduction programs.  The funds needed for
gross property additions are currently provided from operations.  See GEORGIA's
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
Estimated construction expenditures for the years 1994 through 1996 are $688
million, $555 million and $629 million, respectively.  These estimated
expenditures reflect planned but unidentified reductions of $63 million in 1995
and $85 million in 1996 under GEORGIA's business stategy to curtail growth in
costs.  Additionally, based on GEORGIA s preliminary energy and demand forecast
for 1995 and beyond, GEORGIA has canceled the construction of eight combustion
turbine generating units originally scheduled for completion by 1997.  As a
result, estimated construction expenditures will be reduced by $4 million in
1995 and $140 million in 1996 from the estimates shown above.

    The Clean Air Act will have a significant impact on the capital
requirements of the Southern electric system.  This legislation, as well as
other legislation and regulations are described under "Environmental Issues" in
Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in GEORGIA's 1993 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

    As a result of requirements by the NRC, GEORGIA has established external
sinking funds for the purpose of funding nuclear decommissioning costs.  For
1994 through 1996, the amount to be funded for GEORGIA totals $16 million
annually.  For additional information concerning nuclear decommissioning costs,
see Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein.

    Cash requirements for long-term debt maturities and redemptions total
approximately $144.0 million for the twelve months ending June 30, 1995.
However, of this amount, $133.6 million is on deposit with trustees and
specifically designated to redeem certain securities.

SOURCES OF FUNDS
GEORGIA expects to meet future capital requirements primarily using funds from
operations and, if needed, by the issuance of new debt and equity securities,
term loans and short-term borrowings.  Cash from operations for the first six
months of 1994 decreased, as compared to the corresponding period in 1993,
primarily because of the receipt in 1993 of cash payments from Gulf States as
partial settlement of litigation and higher estimated income tax payments in
1994.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  (Continued)

    GEORGIA must comply with coverage requirements of its mortgage indenture
and corporate charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.
GEORGIA's ability to satisfy all coverage requirements is such that it could
issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock to provide sufficient funds
for all anticipated requirements.

    To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had approximately
$393 million of unused credit arrangements with banks at the beginning of the
third quarter of 1994.  Additionally, the completion of the remaining
transaction for the sale of Plant Scherer Unit 4 will generate approximately
$130 million in 1995.

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

    We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of June 30, 1994, and the related condensed
statements of income for the three-month, six-month and twelve-month periods
ended June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the condensed statements of cash flows for
the six-month periods ended June 30, 1994 and 1993.  These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management.

    We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of
which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken
as a whole.  Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

    Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

    As more fully discussed in Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements,
an uncertainty exists with respect to the actions of the regulators regarding
the recoverability of the Company's investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped
storage hydroelectric project.  The outcome of this uncertainty cannot
presently be determined.  Accordingly, no provision for any writedown of the
costs associated with the Rocky Mountain facility resulting from the potential
actions of the Georgia Public Service Commission has been made in the
accompanying Condensed Financial Statements.

    We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1993
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 16, 1994, we included
an explanatory paragraph which describes an uncertainty with respect to the
actions of the regulators regarding the recoverability of the Company's
investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project.  In our
opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet
as of December 31, 1993, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
relation to the balance sheet from which it has been derived.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS
GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter of
1994 was $8.9 million, compared to $7.3 million for the same period of 1993.
The improvement in earnings was primarily due to increased revenues and lower
capital costs.

REVENUES
Retail energy sales for the second quarter of 1994 increased 2.0% over the
corresponding period of 1993 due primarily to the mild temperatures experienced
during the second quarter of 1993 and an increase in the number of customers
served.  However, this increase in retail energy sales was reduced because
GULF's formerly largest industrial customer began operating its co-generation
facility in August 1993.  Wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates decreased
slightly with capacity revenues $0.3 million lower, compared to the second
quarter of 1993.

EXPENSES
Fuel expenses for the second quarter of 1994 increased over the same period of
1993 due to a 17.6% increase in generation.  However, because GULF
renegotiated, bought out or otherwise terminated various coal supply contracts,
the average cost of fuel consumed decreased.  Purchased power transactions
(both sales and purchases) among the affiliated companies within the Southern
electric system will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company.  Other operation
expenses increased because of the recognition of higher costs associated with
the buyouts and renegotiation of coal supply contracts.  The expenses
recognized are based, in part, on the amount of fuel consumed at the generating
plants.  These costs are recoverable through the fuel clause and, thus, have no
impact on earnings.  Also, other operation expenses were increased due to the
recognition of higher employee benefit costs.  Maintenance expenses increased
because of the scheduling of maintenance on production facilities.  Taxes other
than income taxes rose because of higher revenues and additions to plant.  The
increase in income tax expense is attributable to the federal tax rate increase
enacted in August 1993 and higher earnings.

INTEREST CHARGES AND DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED STOCK
The decrease in interest on long-term debt reflects GULF's efforts to decrease
its capital costs.  GULF, in response to the low interest rate levels
prevailing during 1992 and 1993, refinanced a significant portion of its
long-term debt and preferred stock.  To the extent it is economically feasible,
GULF will continue its efforts to lower its capital costs.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

    Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, customer growth, and the rate of economic growth in GULF's service
area.  The enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the
future of the electric utility industry.  A discussion of the potential impact
of the Energy Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under
"Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
GULF's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    See Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 in GULF's 1993 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the hearings ordered by the FERC
regarding the reasonableness of the return on common equity on certain of the
Southern electric system's wholesale rate schedules and contracts.  Also, see
Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for a discussion of a
suit filed against GULF concerning the transportation of coal by barge.

    Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could reduce earnings if such
increased costs are not fully recovered.  The Clean Air Act is discussed
further under  "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in GULF's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  See Note 3 to the
financial statements in Item 8 in GULF's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Environmental Cost Recovery clause which provides for the
expected recovery of such costs.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The major change in GULF's financial condition during the first six months of
1994 was gross property additions of $47.3 million.  The principal sources of
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were provided from
operations and an increase in notes payable.  See the Condensed Statements of
Cash Flows for further details.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION
GULF's gross property additions, including those amounts related to
environmental compliance, are estimated to total approximately $200 million for
the three years 1994 through 1996 ($77 million in 1994, $55 million in 1995 and
$68 million in 1996).  The estimates of property additions for the three-year
period include $25 million committed to meeting the requirements of the Clean
Air Act, the cost of which is expected to be recovered through the
Environmental Cost Recovery clause.  Actual construction costs may vary from
these estimates because of factors such as the granting of timely and adequate
rate increases, changes in environmental regulations, revised load projections,
the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials, and
the cost of capital.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION (Continued)

    Various environmental legislation and other related regulations are
described in "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in GULF's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The full impact of these
requirements cannot be determined at this time, pending the development and
implementation of applicable regulations.

    In addition to the funds required for the construction program, $13.9
million will be required by June 30, 1995, in connection with maturities and
redemptions of long-term debt and preferred stock subject to mandatory
redemption.  This amount includes approximately $9.0 million of long-term notes
payable issued to refinance the termination of a coal supply contract.

    At June 30, 1994, GULF had $0.8 million of cash and $38 million of unused
credit arrangements with banks to meet its short-term cash needs.  GULF had
$49.5 million of short-term bank borrowings outstanding at June 30, 1994.  The
increase in short-term indebtedness is seasonal and the amount outstanding at
the end of summer should be appreciably lower.

    It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be derived
from operations, the sale of additional first mortgage bonds and preferred
stock, and capital contributions from SOUTHERN.  GULF is required to meet
certain coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate
charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.  GULF's coverage
ratios are sufficient to permit, at present interest rate levels, any
foreseeable security sales.  The amount of securities which GULF will be
permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market conditions and other
factors prevailing at that time.

                           MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NET INCOME
MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second
quarter of 1994 was $13.7 million, compared to $11.9 million for the
corresponding period of 1993.  Net income rose primarily because of higher
retail and territorial wholesale energy sales, retail rate increases under PEP
and the ECO Plan and a wholesale rate increase.

REVENUES
Revenues for the second quarter of 1994 increased, compared to the same period
of 1993, because of an increase of 10.2% in retail energy sales, a 15.6%
increase in territorial wholesale energy sales, the retail rate increases
granted under PEP effective July 1993 and the ECO Plan effective in April 1994,
and a wholesale rate increase effective in April 1994.  The increase in retail
energy sales was due to an improving economy in Southeast Mississippi, an
increase in the number of customers served and weather influences.  Energy
sales to residential customers increased by 8.0% and to commercial customers by
12.9%, with the latter reflecting sales to an increasing number of casinos
within MISSISSIPPI's service area.  Energy sales to industrial customers
increased 9.9%.

EXPENSES
Fuel expenses decreased and purchased power expenses increased in the second
quarter of 1994, compared to the corresponding period of 1993, because of lower
generation, which stemmed from the timing of maintenance on generating
facilities.  Purchased power transactions (both sales and purchases) among the
affiliated companies within the Southern electric system will vary from period
to period depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources at each company.

    Taxes other than income taxes increased because of additions to utility
plant and higher revenues.  The increase in income tax expense reflects the
increase in earnings and the federal tax rate increase enacted in August 1993.

    The increase in interest expense was due to the sale or issuance of
additional debt instruments.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction.  The equity portion of AFUDC represents non-cash income.
However, when facilities are completed and included in rate base, previously
capitalized amounts increase cash flow because revenues are higher as a result
of the increased rate base and additional depreciation expense.  In May 1994,
MISSISSIPPI began commercial operation of a 74.6-megawatt combustion turbine
unit whose entire output is dedicated to a single industrial customer.  The
recording of AFUDC for a construction project ceases upon commercial operation
of the project.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings is contingent upon
numerous factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.
Operating revenues will be affected by changes in rates under the PEP and ECO
plans.  The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force on electric rates, with
only moderate changes in rates taking place.  Also see Note (B) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for information regarding FERC's review
of equity returns.

    MISSISSIPPI's 1994 annual filing under the ECO Plan with the Mississippi
PSC resulted in an approved annual revenue requirement increase of $7.6
million, effective in April 1994.  The FERC approved MISSISSIPPI's wholesale
rate increase petition for $3.6 million, effective April 1994.

    MISSISSIPPI initiated an early retirement incentive program in April 1994.
The costs associated with this program, as well as MISSISSIPPI's pro rata share
of a similar program at SCS, have been deferred.  For further information on
these programs and the accounting treatment, see Note (K) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein.

    Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors
have included the rate of economic growth in MISSISSIPPI's service area,
customer growth, competition, weather, changes in contracts with neighboring
utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, and the elasticity of
demand.  The enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the
future of the electric utility industry.  A discussion of the potential impact
of the Energy Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under
"Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
MISSISSIPPI's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
During the first six months of 1994, gross property additions were $58.6
million.  The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were
derived primarily from internal sources, the sale of $35 million of first
mortgage bonds, the issuance of $50 million of long-term notes payable and the
receipt of $25 million in capital contributions.  See the Condensed Statements
of Cash Flows for further details.

    At June 30, 1994, cash totaled approximately $3.1 million and MISSISSIPPI
had $96 million of unused credit arrangements with banks to meet short-term
cash needs.  MISSISSIPPI had $43 million of notes payable outstanding at
quarter-end.  It is MISSISSIPPI s strategy to maintain a permanent

layer of short-term debt, approximately $40 million through the end of 1994,
consistent with its overall risk capital strategy.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
MISSISSIPPI's gross property additions for the next three years are estimated
to be $256 million ($96 million in 1994, $62 million in 1995 and $98 million in
1996).  The major emphasis within the construction program will be on complying
with Clean Air Act regulations and upgrading existing facilities.  Revisions
may be necessary because of factors such as revised load projections, the
availability and cost of capital and changes in environmental regulations.

    In addition to the funds required for the construction program,
approximately $10.9 million will be required by June 30, 1995, for maturities
of long-term debt.  It is anticipated that the funds required for construction
and other purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will
be derived from operations, the sale of additional first mortgage bonds,
pollution control bonds and preferred stock and the receipt of additional
capital contributions from SOUTHERN.  MISSISSIPPI is required to meet certain
coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter
to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.  MISSISSIPPI's coverage
ratios are sufficiently high to permit, at present interest rate levels, any
foreseeable security sales.  The amount of securities which MISSISSIPPI will be
able to issue in the future will depend upon market conditions and other
factors prevailing at that time.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the Southern
electric system's capital requirements and operating costs.  The acid rain
compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will have a significant impact on the
Southern electric system.  This legislation, as well as other legislation and
regulations, are described under "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 -
Management's Discussion and Analysis in MISSISSIPPI's 1993 Annual Report on
Form 10-K.  The full impact of these requirements cannot be determined at this
time pending the development and implementation of applicable regulations.
MISSISSIPPI's management believes that the ECO Plan will provide for retail
recovery of the Clean Air Act costs.

    MISSISSIPPI must comply with environmental laws and regulations that cover
the handling and disposal of hazardous waste.  Under these various laws and
regulations, MISSISSIPPI could incur costs to clean up properties currently or
previously owned.  Upon identifying potential sites MISSISSIPPI conducts
studies to determine the extent of any required clean-up costs.  Sites with
potential for remediation are being investigated, but no prediction can
presently be made regarding the extent, if any, of contamination or possible
cleanup.  Should remediation be determined to be probable, reasonable estimates
of costs to clean up such sites are developed and recognized in the financial
statements.

                      SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS
SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
of 1994 dipped to $6.1 million, compared to $6.2 million in the corresponding
period of 1993.  The decrease in net income was primarily due to higher
interest costs because of a greater amount of debt outstanding and the increase
in the federal income tax rate.

REVENUES
Revenues for the second quarter of 1994 increased, compared to the
corresponding period in 1993, due to higher retail energy sales.  Energy sales
to retail customers increased 2.6% due to an improving economy in SAVANNAH's
service territory and an increase in the number of customers served.  Wholesale
energy sales to non-affiliated companies decreased, however, only the capacity
revenues of such sales have any measurable effect on earnings.  Capacity
revenues fell $133,000.

EXPENSES
Fuel expenses during the second quarter of 1994 decreased, compared to those
recorded in the second quarter of 1993, because of a 22.1% drop in generation.
This was partially offset by an increase in the average cost of coal on the
spot market (SAVANNAH has no long-term coal supply contracts) due to a coal
miners strike and higher freight charges.  Purchased power transactions (both
sales and purchases) among the affiliated companies within the Southern
electric system will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company.  These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.  Other operation
expenses increased due, in part, to the costs incurred to restore electric
service which was interrupted by a severe storm in June 1994.  Income taxes
increased because of the higher federal income tax rates enacted in August
1993.

    The increases in interest on long-term debt and dividends on preferred
stock reflect the sale by SAVANNAH in 1993 of $45 million of first mortgage
bonds and $35 million of preferred stock.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction and is included in rate base.  The equity portion of AFUDC
represents non-cash income.  In addition, when facilities are completed and
included in rate base, previously capitalized amounts increase cash flow
because revenues are higher as a result of the increased rate base and
additional depreciation expense.  The amount of AFUDC recorded has risen
because of SAVANNAH's investment in the construction of two 80-megawatt
combustion turbine peaking units.  These units were placed in service in April
and May 1994.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.

   Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
increased costs cannot be offset.  The Clean Air Act is discussed under
"Capital Requirements for Construction" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in SAVANNAH's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, and the rate of economic growth in SAVANNAH's service area.  The
enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the future of the
electric utility industry.  A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy
Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SAVANNAH's 1993
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
During the first six months of 1994, SAVANNAH made gross property additions to
utility plant of $17.3 million.  The funds for these additions and other
capital requirements came from an increase in short-term and long-term debt and
from operating activities, principally from earnings and noncash charges to
income such as depreciation.  See the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION
SAVANNAH's construction program is budgeted at $98 million for the three years
1994 through 1996 ($33 million in 1994, $32 million in 1995 and $33 million in
1996).  Actual construction costs may vary from this estimate because of such
factors as changes in environmental regulations; the cost and efficiency of
construction labor, equipment and materials; revised load projections and the
cost of capital.  The largest project during this period is the addition of two
80-megawatt combustion turbine units, which were placed in service in April and
May 1994.

Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the
Southern electric system's capital requirements and operating costs.  The acid
rain compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will have a significant impact
on the Southern electric system.  This legislation, as well as other
legislation and regulations, are described under "Environmental Matters" in
Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SAVANNAH's 1993 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.  The full impact of these

FINANCIAL CONDITION  (Continued)

requirements cannot be determined at this time, pending the development and
implementation of applicable regulations.  There can be no assurance that
compliance costs will be recovered through corresponding increases in rates.

SOURCES OF CAPITAL
At June 30, 1994, SAVANNAH had $5.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and
$20 million of unused credit arrangements with banks to meet its short-term
cash needs.  SAVANNAH had $12 million of short-term debt outstanding at
quarter-end.  The increase in short-term indebtedness is primarily seasonal and
the amount outstanding is expected to be reduced by the end of the summer.
SAVANNAH has received the authority from the SEC to have outstanding at any one
time an amount of up to $70 million in short-term borrowings.

    It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be derived
from operations and the sale of additional first mortgage bonds and preferred
stock and capital contributions from SOUTHERN.  SAVANNAH is required to meet
certain coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate
charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.  SAVANNAH's
coverage ratios are sufficiently high to permit, at present interest rate
levels, any foreseeable security sales.  The amount of securities which
SAVANNAH will be permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market
conditions and other factors prevailing at that time.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)  Reference is made to Item 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS in the SOUTHERN system's
     combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993
     for a description of the proceedings related to a derivative action filed
     against certain current and former directors and officers of SOUTHERN.  In
     April 1994, the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded the
     case to the trial court, finding that allegations by the plaintiffs
     created a reasonable doubt that the board validly exercised its business
     judgment in refusing the earlier demand.

(B)  Reference is made to Note 3 to each of the registrant's, except SAVANNAH's
     notes to the financial statements in Item 8 in the SOUTHERN system's
     combined 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the hearings
     ordered by the FERC regarding the reasonableness of the return on common
     equity on certain of the Southern electric system's wholesale rate
     schedules and contracts.

(C)  For information regarding the expected costs of decommissioning nuclear
     facilities reference is made to Note (C) to the Condensed Financial
     Statements in the SOUTHERN system s combined Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
     for March 31, 1994.

(D)  For information regarding nuclear insurance reference is made to Notes 13,
     11 and 4 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA,
     respectively, in Item 8 in the SOUTHERN system s combined 1993 Annual
     Report on Form 10-K and Note (D) to the Condensed Financial Statements in
     the SOUTHERN system s combined Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for March 31,
     1994.  During the second quarter of 1994, the by-laws of Nuclear Mutual
     Limited were amended whereby a member cannot receive a refund in the event
     insurance coverage is terminated.

(E)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
     ALABAMA in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1993 Annual Report on
     Form 10-K for information with respect to a civil complaint filed
     regarding ALABAMA's financing of heat pumps and other merchandise.

(F)  Pursuant to orders from the Georgia PSC, GEORGIA deferred financing and
     depreciation costs under phase-in plans for Plant Vogtle units 1 and 2
     until the allowed investment was fully reflected in rates as of October
     1991.  In addition, the Georgia PSC issued two separate accounting orders
     that required GEORGIA to defer substantially all operating and financing
     costs related to both units until rate orders addressed these costs.  The
     Georgia PSC orders provide for recovery of deferred costs within 10 years.
     The Georgia PSC also ordered GEORGIA to levelize declining capacity
     buyback expense from the co-owners of the plant over a six-year period
     beginning


                                      69

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued)

     October 1991.  The unamortized balance of these deferred costs at June 30,
     1994, was $479 million.

(G)  Reference is made to Note 4 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1993 Annual Report on
     Form 10-K for information concerning the uncertainty related to the
     actions of regulatory authorities with respect to the recovery of costs of
     the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project.  The ultimate
     outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

(H)  In October 1993, a Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, judge ruled
     that rate riders previously approved by the Georgia PSC for recovery of
     GEORGIA's costs incurred in connection with demand-side conservation
     programs were unlawful.  The judge held that the Georgia PSC lacked
     statutory authority to approve such rate riders except through general
     rate case proceedings and that those procedures had not been followed.
     GEORGIA suspended collection of the demand-side conservation costs and
     appealed to the Georgia Court of Appeals, which reversed the court s
     decision as described below.  In December 1993, the Georgia PSC approved
     GEORGIA's request for an accounting order allowing GEORGIA to defer all
     current unrecovered and future costs related to these programs until the
     court s decision is reversed or until the next general rate case
     proceeding.  An association of industrial customers has filed a petition
     for review of such accounting order in the Superior Court of Fulton
     County, Georgia.  GEORGIA's costs related to these conservation programs
     through June 1994 were $90 million of which $15 million has been collected
     and the remainder deferred.  The estimated costs are $21 million for the
     remainder of 1994 and $43 million in 1995.

        In July 1994, the Georgia Court of Appeals, reversing the superior
     court decision discussed above, ruled that the Georgia PSC could lawfully
     provide for recovery of demand-side conservation program costs through
     rate riders.  The opposing parties have filed notices of their intention
     to appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.  GEORGIA is continuing to defer
     program costs pending final resolution of this matter.

        The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined; however, in
     management's opinion, the final outcome will not have a material adverse
     effect on SOUTHERN's or GEORGIA's Condensed Financial Statements.

(I)  In June 1994, a tax deficiency notice was received from the IRS for the
     years 1984 through 1987 in regards to the tax accounting by GEORGIA for a
     1984 property transaction.  The potential tax deficiency arising from this
     issue would amount to approximately $30 million of tax plus an additional
     $33 million of interest.  The tax deficiency relates to a timing issue as
     to when taxes are paid, therefore only the interest portion could impact
     future income.  Management believes that the IRS position is incorrect and
     will file a petition with the United States Tax Court to appeal the IRS
     position.  The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined;
     however, in management s opinion, the final outcome will not have a
     material adverse effect on SOUTHERN's or GEORGIA's Condensed Financial
     Statements.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued)

(J)  In August 1993, a complaint against GULF and SCS was filed in federal
     district court in Ohio by two companies with which GULF has contracted for
     the transportation by barge of certain of GULF's coal supplies.  The
     complaint alleges breach of the contract by GULF and seeks damages
     estimated by the plaintiffs to be in excess of $85 million.  The final
     outcome of this matter cannot now be determined; however, in management's
     opinion the final outcome will not have a material adverse effect on
     SOUTHERN's or GULF's Condensed Financial Statements.

(K)  During 1994, GEORGIA and SCS, the system service company, instituted work
     force reduction programs.  The costs related to these programs amounted to
     approximately $75.9 million for GEORGIA and $25.7 million for SCS.  The
     costs of the SCS work force reduction program were apportioned among the
     various entities that together form the Southern electric system.
     MISSISSIPPI instituted an early retirement incentive program in April 1994
     and deferred the related costs of approximately $13.3 million.
     MISSISSIPPI has received authority from the Mississippi PSC to defer these
     costs, as well as its portion of the costs of a similar SCS program, and
     to amortize over a period not to exceed 60 months, beginning no later than
     January 1995.  Additionally, SAVANNAH instituted a work force reduction
     program in late 1993 and incurred related charges of approximately $4.5
     million.

(L)  In July 1994, OPC and MEAG filed a joint complaint with the FERC seeking
     to recover from GEORGIA an aggregate of approximately $16.5 million in
     alleged partial requirements rates overcharges, plus approximately $6.3
     million in interest.  OPC and MEAG claim that GEORGIA improperly reflected
     in such rates costs associated with capacity that had previously been sold
     to Gulf States pursuant to a unit power sales contract or, alternatively,
     that they should be allocated a portion of the proceeds received by
     GEORGIA as the result of a settlement with Gulf States of litigation
     arising out of such contract.  (For information concerning the Gulf States
     settlement, see Note 8 and Note 3, respectively, to the financial
     statements of SOUTHERN and GEORGIA in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system s
     combined 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  In August 1994, OPC and MEAG
     also filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia,
     urging substantially the same claims and asking the court to hear the
     matter in the event the FERC declines jurisdiction.  GEORGIA intends to
     contest the complaints filed against it.  While the outcome of this matter
     cannot be determined, in management's opinion it will not have a material
     adverse effect on SOUTHERN's or GEORGIA's financial condition.

(M)  In compliance with the recently enacted Georgia Hazardous Site Response
     Act, the State of Georgia was required to compile an inventory of all
     known or suspected sites where hazardous wastes, constituents or
     substances have been disposed of or released in quantities deemed
     reportable by the State.  In developing this list, the State of Georgia
     identified several hundred properties throughout the State, including 23
     sites which may require environmental remediation by GEORGIA.  The
     majority of these sites are electrical power substations and power
     generation facilities.  GEORGIA has recognized $2 million in expenses for
     the anticipated clean-up cost for one site that GEORGIA plans to
     remediate.  GEORGIA will conduct studies at each of the remaining sites to
     determine the extent of remediation and associated clean-up costs, if any,
     that may be required.  GEORGIA has recognized $3 million in expenses for
     the anticipated cost of completing such studies.  Any cost of remediating
     the remaining sites cannot presently be

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued)

     determined until such studies are completed for each site, and the State
     of Georgia determines whether remediation is required.  If all sites were
     required to be remediated, GEORGIA could incur expenses of up to $25
     million in additional clean-up costs, and construction expenditures of up
     to $100 million to develop new waste management facilities or install
     additional pollution control devices.  The final outcome of this matter
     cannot now be determined; however, in management s opinion the final
     outcome will not have a material adverse effect on SOUTHERN's or GEORGIA's
     Condensed Financial Statements.

PART II       -    OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.            Legal Proceedings.

              (1)  Reference is made to the Notes to Condensed Financial
                   Statements herein for information regarding certain legal
                   and administrative proceedings in which SOUTHERN and its
                   reporting subsidiaries are involved.

              (2)  In May 1994, GEORGIA received a notice of violation from the
                   NRC proposing a civil penalty in the amount of $200,000
                   based upon allegedly inaccurate and incomplete information
                   relating to Plant Vogtle reported to the NRC in 1990.  The
                   NRC also issued demands for information regarding alleged
                   performance failures by six individual employees to enable
                   the NRC to determine whether additional enforcement actions
                   are necessary.

                       In its responses to the notice of violation, submitted
                   to the NRC in August 1994, GEORGIA denied certain of the 
                   NRC's allegations and admitted others.  GEORGIA further
                   requested reconsideration of the level of the proposed civil
                   penalty.  GEORGIA has also furnished various information to
                   the NRC in response to the demands described above.

Item 4.            Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

                   SOUTHERN
                   SOUTHERN held its annual meeting of stockholders on May 25,
                   1994.  The following resolutions were voted upon at this
                   meeting.

              (1)  A proposal requiring additional disclosure of executive
                   compensation was defeated by a vote of 379,571,936 shares
                   against; 87,991,908 shares for; and 13,986,686 shares
                   abstaining.

              (2)  A proposal seeking to limit executive compensation was 
                   defeated by a vote of 370,102,931 shares against; 
                   95,431,564 shares for; and 16,016,838 shares abstaining.

              (3)  A proposal to approve SOUTHERN's Outside Directors Stock
