           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

     This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking and historical
information. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by
terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates,"
"believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative
of these terms or other comparable terminology. The registrants caution that
there are various important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements; accordingly,
there can be no assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These
factors include the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory
change, including legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation
and restructuring of the electric utility industry and also changes in
environmental and other laws and regulations to which SOUTHERN and its
subsidiaries are subject, as well as changes in application of existing laws and
regulations; current and future litigation, including the pending EPA civil
action against certain of the integrated Southeast utilities and the race
discrimination litigation against certain of SOUTHERN's subsidiaries; the
effects, extent and timing of additional competition in the markets of
SOUTHERN's subsidiaries; potential business strategies, including acquisitions
or dispositions of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured to be completed
or beneficial; internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may be
pursued by SOUTHERN; state and federal rate regulation in the United States;
political, legal and economic conditions and developments in the United States;
financial market conditions and the results of financing efforts; the impact of
fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and customer demand; weather
and other natural phenomena; the performance of projects undertaken by the
non-traditional business and the success of efforts to invest in and develop new
opportunities; the timing and acceptance of SOUTHERN's new product and service
offerings; the ability of SOUTHERN to obtain additional generating capacity at
competitive prices; and other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in other
reports (including Form 10-K) filed from time to time with the SEC.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                  SECOND QUARTER 2001 vs. SECOND QUARTER 2000
                                       AND
                     YEAR-TO-DATE 2001 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 2000

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Effective April 2, 2001, SOUTHERN completed a spin off of
its remaining ownership of 272 million Mirant shares to SOUTHERN's shareholders
in a tax free distribution. Shares from the spin off were distributed at a rate
of approximately 0.4 share of Mirant common stock for every share of SOUTHERN
common stock held at the record date. As a result of the spin off, SOUTHERN's
financial statements reflect Mirant as discontinued operations.

     SOUTHERN is now focusing on three main businesses in the Southeast: its
traditional business, represented by its five integrated Southeast utilities
providing electric service in four states; a growing competitive generation
business in the eight state "Super Southeast" region; and energy-related
products and services for its retail customers.

Earnings

SOUTHERN's second quarter and year-to-date 2001 earnings from continuing
operations were $270 million ($0.40 per share) and $450 million ($0.66 per
share), respectively, compared with $256 million ($0.39 per share) and $407
million ($0.62 per share) in the second quarter and year-to-date 2000. The
increases in earnings for the second quarter and year-to-date 2001 are primarily
due to several factors, including growth in the competitive wholesale generation
business, higher other operating revenues and lower interest expense, partially
offset by the impact of unusually mild weather in the Southeast.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue was down by $44 million or 2.9% in the second
quarter of 2001 and up by approximately $4 million or 0.1% year-to-date 2001
compared to the same periods in the prior year. The second quarter 2001 decrease
is primarily due to milder weather in this period as compared to the second
quarter 2000. Total retail energy sales were down by 3.1% in the second quarter
of 2001. The year-to-date 2001 increase is primarily due to increased energy
sales to residential and commercial customers due to a 1.7% growth in the
average number of customers served when compared to the same period in the prior
year.

     Sales for resale. The second quarter and year-to-date 2001 increases are
mostly due to increased demand for energy by non-affiliated companies. Also
reflected in these revenues are sales from Plant Dahlberg which went into
service in the second quarter of 2000.

     Other revenues. During the second quarter and year-to-date 2001, other
revenues increased due to several factors including increased revenues from
gas-fueled cogeneration steam facilities, transmission of electricity for
others, pole attachments and distribution systems equipment rentals, as well as
fuel clause adjustments. However, cogeneration revenues and fuel clause
adjustments generally have no material effect on net income since they are
generally equal to related fuel expenses.

     Fuel expense. For the second quarter 2001, fuel expense increased when
compared to the same period in 2000 primarily due to higher natural gas prices.
The increase in the second quarter 2001 was partially offset by decreased
generation resulting from lower demand for energy in some of the areas served by
the integrated Southeast utilities due in part to the unusually mild weather.
The year-to-date 2001 increase in fuel expense is mainly attributed to increased
generation resulting from higher demand for energy and higher natural gas
prices. Since energy expenses are usually offset by energy revenues, these
expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power expense. In the second quarter and year-to-date 2001, this
expense increased above amounts recorded in the corresponding periods of 2000
due in large part to increased demand for energy by wholesale customers and
increased prices for natural gas. Since energy expenses are usually offset by
energy revenues, these expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Maintenance expense. These expenses were higher in the second quarter and
year-to-date 2001 when compared to the same periods in 2000 due mostly to
scheduled work performed on power generating facilities and transmission and
distribution facilities.

     Depreciation and amortization. This item was lower in the second quarter
and year-to-date 2001 as compared to the same periods in 2000 in accordance with
GEORGIA's 1998 rate plan, as authorized by the Georgia PSC. Reference is made to
Note (G) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein and Item 7
- - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA
in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. The second quarter and
year-to-date 2001 decreases in this item primarily relate to the investment by
SOUTHERN, in April 2001, in a partnership producing alternative fuel products.

     Interest expense, net. During the second quarter and year-to-date 2001,
interest on long-term debt and interest on notes payable decreased when compared
to the same periods in 2000. Reasons for these decreases include the redemption
of first mortgage bonds and the repayment of other long-term debt in the first
half of 2001 and declining short-term debt and lower interest rates on
outstanding notes payable.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors. The two major factors are the ability of the integrated Southeast
utilities to achieve energy sales growth while containing cost in a more
competitive environment; and the profitability of the new competitive
market-based wholesale generating facilities being added. For additional
information relating to the other businesses, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Other
Business" in the Form 10-K. Also, reference is made to Note (B) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for information relating to the spin
off of Mirant.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     On March 14, 2001, the FERC rejected certain elements of SOUTHERN's RTO
proposal. For additional information on the FERC's response to SOUTHERN's
proposal, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Integrated Southeast
Utilities" in the Form 10-K. Following the March 14, 2001 order, SOUTHERN
submitted a series of status reports informing the FERC of progress toward the
development of a Southeastern RTO. In these status reports, SOUTHERN explained
that it has entered into memoranda of understanding to develop an RTO with eight
non-jurisdictional cooperative and public power entities. In addition, SOUTHERN
has entered into a memorandum of understanding with TVA to address coordination
issues between their transmission systems. On July 12, 2001, the FERC issued an
order on the status reports of SOUTHERN, as well as GridSouth and
Entergy/Southwest Power Pool. In those orders, the FERC indicated that it
favored a single RTO for the Southeast. The FERC initiated a mediation process,
directed the parties to participate in the mediation for 45 days and ordered the
mediator to file a report within 10 days following the end of the mediation.
These discussions are ongoing and it is expected that the mediator will make a
report by mid-September 2001.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in
the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) through (K), (N) and (O) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries adopted FASB Statement
No. 133, as amended, and changed the method of accounting for derivative
instruments. All derivatives are now reflected on the Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheet at fair market value. Reference is made to Note (C) in the "Notes
to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information on the
adoption of Statement No. 133.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations,"
which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for business
combinations and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16.
All business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 must now be accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting.

     Also in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17.
It addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a
group of other assets (but not those acquired in a business combination) should
be accounted for upon acquisition and on an ongoing basis. Goodwill and
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but
rather will be tested at least annually for impairment. Intangible assets that
have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives,
which are no longer limited to 40 years. The provisions of Statement No. 142
must be adopted in 2002. SOUTHERN has not yet quantified the impact of adopting
Statement No. 142 on its financial statements; however, the impact is not
expected to be material.

     Additionally in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset
Retirement Obligations," which establishes new accounting and reporting
standards for legal obligations associated with retiring assets, including
decommissioning nuclear plants. The fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation must be recorded in the period in which it is incurred,
with the cost capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting
from the passage of time will be recognized as operating expenses. Statement No.
143 must be adopted by 2003. SOUTHERN has not yet quantified the impact of
adopting Statement No. 143 on its financial statements. Reference is made to
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN,
ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial statements of
SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA under "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning"
in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first six months of
2001 included $1.4 billion used for gross property additions to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were from
operations and other long-term debt. See SOUTHERN's Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Financing Activities

In February 2001, GEORGIA issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of
senior notes consisting of $200 million of Series F 5.75% Senior Notes due
January 31, 2003 and $150 million Series G 6.20% Senior Notes due February 1,
2006. The proceeds of the sale were applied to redeem $200 million of GEORGIA's
First Mortgage Bonds, 6 5/8% Series due April 2003 and to repay a portion of
GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness. Also in February 2001, GEORGIA
issued $100 million of Series H 6.70% Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due March
1, 2011. The proceeds of this sale were used to repay an additional portion of
GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     In April 2001, ALABAMA sold, through a public authority, $10 million of
variable rate demand revenue bonds due April 1, 2031. In May 2001, GEORGIA
issued $150 million of Series I 5.25% Senior Notes due May 8, 2003. The proceeds
of this sale were used in May 2001 to repurchase $47 million aggregate principal
amount of GEORGIA's First Mortgage Bonds, 7.70% Series due May 1, 2025, $1.9
million aggregate principal amount of GEORGIA's First Mortgage Bonds, 6 7/8%
Series due April 1, 2008 and $8.1 million aggregate principal amount of
GEORGIA's First Mortgage Bonds, 6.07% Series due December 1, 2005, and to redeem
in June 2001 $75 million outstanding principal amount of GEORGIA's First
Mortgage Bonds, 6.35% Series due August 1, 2003. The remainder was used to repay
a portion of GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness. Also in May 2001,
SAVANNAH issued $65 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes
consisting of $20 million of Series B 5.12% Senior Notes due May 15, 2003 and
$45 million of Series C 6.55% Senior Notes due May 15, 2008. The proceeds of the
sale were used to redeem in June 2001 the $20 million outstanding principal
amount of SAVANNAH's First Mortgage Bonds, 6 3/8% Series due July 1, 2003 and to
repay $30 million in bank loans and a portion of SAVANNAH's outstanding
short-term indebtedness.

     In July 2001, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, an aggregate
principal amount of $58,845,000 of pollution control revenue bonds due July 1,
2031. Also in July 2001, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, $67 million
of pollution control revenue bonds due July 1, 2016. The proceeds of these sales
will be used to redeem various series of outstanding pollution control revenue
bonds. On August 3, 2001, GULF issued $60 million of Series C 4.69% Senior Notes
due August 1, 2003. The proceeds of the sale will be used to redeem $30 million
outstanding principal amount of GULF's First Mortgage Bonds, 6 1/8% Series due
July 1, 2003 and to repay a portion of GULF's short-term indebtedness.

     The market price of SOUTHERN's common stock at June 30, 2001 was $23.25 per
share and the book value was $10.94 per share, representing a market-to-book
ratio of 213%, compared to $33.25, $15.69 and 212%, respectively, at the end of
2000. The decreases in market price and book value per share reflect the impact
of the Mirant spin off. The dividend for the second quarter of 2001 was $0.335
per share.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements", "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Matters" of
SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for a description of the SOUTHERN system's capital
requirements for its construction program, sinking fund requirements, maturing
debt and environmental compliance efforts. Approximately $562 million will be
required by June 30, 2002 for redemptions and maturities of long-term debt.
Also, the integrated Southeast utilities plan to continue, to the extent
possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 2001, as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
integrated Southeast utilities plan to obtain the funds required for
construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past.
The amount, type and timing of any financings--if needed--will depend upon
market conditions and regulatory approval. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
June 30, 2001 approximately $200 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $5.1 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. These
unused credit arrangements also provide liquidity support to variable rate
pollution control bonds and commercial paper programs. SOUTHERN's integrated
Southeast utilities may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for
the benefit of each of the integrated Southeast utilities. At June 30, 2001, the
SOUTHERN system had short-term notes payable outstanding of $324 million and
commercial paper outstanding of $2.2 billion. Management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
and year-to-date 2001 was $75.4 million and $145.4 million, respectively,
compared to $103.2 million and $170.7 million for the corresponding periods of
2000. The decreases in the second quarter and year-to-date 2001 of $27.8 million
or 26.9% and $25.3 million or 14.8%, respectively, were primarily due to lower
retail sales revenue and higher operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue was lower by $19.8 million or 3.7% for the second
quarter 2001 and $15.5 million or 1.6% year-to-date 2001 when compared to the
corresponding periods in 2000 due mainly to decreased energy sales to retail
customers. As a result of milder weather, energy sales to residential customers
decreased 4.2% during the second quarter of 2001. Energy sales to industrial
customers were down for the second quarter and year-to-date 2001 by 4.2% and
8.0%, respectively, due to a slower economy.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. Increased demand for energy by
non-affiliates during the second quarter and year-to-date 2001 translated to
higher revenues from sales for resale to non-affiliates. These transactions did
not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is usually sold at
variable cost.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies within the SOUTHERN system, as
well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. Increased steam sales in conjunction with the operation of
cogeneration facilities was the primary reason for the increase in other
revenues for the second quarter and year-to-date 2001 when compared to the same
periods in 2000. Since cogeneration steam revenues are generally offset by fuel
expenses, these revenues did not have a significant impact on earnings.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Fuel expense. Increased generation by gas-fueled plants resulted in higher
fuel expense for the second quarter and year-to-date 2001 when compared to the
corresponding periods in 2000. Since energy expenses are generally offset by
energy revenues, these expenses did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. Increases in purchased power from
non-affiliates in the second quarter and year-to-date 2001 when compared to the
same periods in 2000 are primarily due to higher costs associated with these
energy purchases. These expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings
since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues.

     Maintenance expense. These increases during the second quarter and
year-to-date 2001 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2000 are a result
of higher expenses related to the maintenance of transmission and distribution
lines.

     Depreciation and amortization. The increases for the second quarter and
year-to-date 2001 as compared to the same periods in 2000 are primarily due to
increased depreciation expenses associated with recent generating capacity
additions.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, ALABAMA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     On March 14, 2001, the FERC rejected certain elements of SOUTHERN's RTO
proposal. For additional information on the FERC's response to SOUTHERN's
proposal, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Integrated Southeast
Utilities" in the Form 10-K. Following the March 14, 2001 order, SOUTHERN
submitted a series of status reports informing the FERC of progress toward the
development of a Southeastern RTO. In these status reports, SOUTHERN explained
that it has entered into memoranda of understanding to develop an RTO with eight
non-jurisdictional cooperative and public power entities. In addition, SOUTHERN
has entered into a memorandum of understanding with TVA to address coordination
issues between their transmission systems. On July 12, 2001, the FERC issued an
order on the status reports of SOUTHERN, as well as GridSouth and
Entergy/Southwest Power Pool. In those orders, the FERC indicated that it
favored a single RTO for the Southeast. The FERC initiated a mediation process,
directed the parties to participate in the mediation for 45 days and ordered the
mediator to file a report within 10 days following the end of the mediation.
These discussions are ongoing and it is expected that the mediator will make a
report by mid-September 2001.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of ALABAMA in the
Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     Reference is made to Notes (C) through (F), (K) and (N) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, ALABAMA adopted FASB Statement No. 133, as amended,
and changed the method of accounting for derivative instruments. All derivatives
are now reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair market
value. Reference is made to Note (C) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information on the adoption of Statement No.
133.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations,"
which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for business
combinations and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16.
All business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 must now be accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting.

     Also in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17.
It addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a
group of other assets (but not those acquired in a business combination) should
be accounted for upon acquisition and on an ongoing basis. Goodwill and
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but
rather will be tested at least annually for impairment. Intangible assets that
have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives,
which are no longer limited to 40 years. The provisions of Statement No. 142
must be adopted in 2002. ALABAMA has not yet quantified the impact of adopting
Statement No. 142 on its financial statements; however, the impact is not
expected to be material.

     Additionally in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset
Retirement Obligations," which establishes new accounting and reporting
standards for legal obligations associated with retiring assets, including
decommissioning nuclear plants. The fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation must be recorded in the period in which it is incurred,
with the cost capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting
from the passage of time will be recognized as operating expenses. Statement No.
143 must be adopted by 2003. ALABAMA has not yet quantified the impact of
adopting Statement No. 143 on its financial statements. Reference is made to
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN,
ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial statements of
SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA under "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning"
in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first six months of
2001 included the addition of approximately $341 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities and the sale of additional common stock to and capital
contributions from SOUTHERN. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
for further details.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Financing Activities

In April 2001, ALABAMA sold, through a public authority, $10 million of variable
rate demand revenue bonds due April 1, 2031. The proceeds of the sale were used
to pay certain costs incurred in connection with the acquisition, construction,
installation and equipping of certain local district heating and cooling
facilities and sewage and solid waste facilities at ALABAMA's Theodore
Congeneration Plant. ALABAMA has called for redemption in August 2001 the $131.5
million outstanding principal amount of its First Mortgage Bonds, 9% Series due
February 1, 2024. ALABAMA plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program
to retire higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost
capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of ALABAMA
under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital requirements
for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental compliance
efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at June 30,
2001 approximately $15 million of cash and cash equivalents, unused committed
lines of credit of approximately $962 million (including $429 million of such
lines under which borrowings may be made only to fund purchase obligations
relating to variable rate pollution control bonds) and an extendible commercial
note program. ALABAMA may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for
the benefit of ALABAMA and other SOUTHERN subsidiaries. ALABAMA has regulatory
authority for up to $750 million of short-term borrowings. At June 30, 2001,
ALABAMA had outstanding $136 million in notes payable, $309 million of
commercial paper and $61 million of extendible commercial notes.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
and year-to-date 2001 was $163.1 million and $270.8 million, respectively,
compared to $148.5 million and $242.2 million for the corresponding periods in
2000. Earnings increased by $14.6 million or 9.8% for the second quarter 2001
and $28.5 million or 11.8% year-to-date 2001 when compared to the same periods
in 2000 due primarily to increased operating revenues that were partially offset
by increased operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

</TABLE>

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue decreased in the second quarter of 2001 by $22.1
million or 2.8% and increased year-to-date 2001 by $12.1 million or 0.8% when
compared to the respective periods in 2000. The decrease for the second quarter
2001 is primarily due to a 5% decrease in energy sales to residential customers
as a result of milder weather in this quarter compared to the same period in the
prior year and an 8.8% decrease in energy sales to industrial customers due to a
continued slowdown in manufacturing activity that is occurring in the State of
Georgia, partially offset by a 2.4% increase in commercial energy sales due to
increased number of commercial customers. The year-to-date 2001 retail sales
revenue was higher due primarily to a 4.9% increase in energy sales to
commercial customers partially offset by the milder weather in the second
quarter.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. During the second quarter and
year-to-date 2001, sales for resale to non-affiliates was higher when compared
to the corresponding periods in 2000 primarily due to increased demand for
energy which was in large part offset by energy expenses. Also, reflected in
these revenues are sales from Plant Dahlberg which went into service in the
second quarter of 2000.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. For the second quarter and year-to-date 2001, other
revenues increased when compared to the same periods in 2000 due mainly to
higher revenues from transmission of electricity for others and distribution
systems equipment rentals.

     Fuel expense. During the second quarter of 2001, fuel expense went down
when compared to the same period in 2000 due primarily to decreased generation
due to reduced demand for energy by retail customers. Fuel costs year-to-date
2001 remained relatively flat when compared to the corresponding period in 2000.
Since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues, these expenses do
not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. For the second quarter and year-to-date
2001, the costs associated with purchased power from non-affiliates were higher
due to increased demand for energy by wholesale customers and increased prices
for natural gas and oil. These expenses do not have a significant impact on
earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues.

     Maintenance expense. The primary reason for the second quarter and
year-to-date 2001 increases when compared to the corresponding periods in 2000
is work performed on power generating facilities and transmission and
distribution facilities.

     Depreciation and amortization. The second quarter and year-to-date 2001
decreases result from lower depreciation charges under the 1998 rate plan.

Statements" herein and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K for additional information.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GEORGIA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form
10-K.

     Pursuant to GEORGIA's existing rate order approved by the Georgia PSC,
GEORGIA was required to file a general rate case with the Georgia PSC by July 1,
2001. Accordingly, on June 29, 2001, GEORGIA filed a rate plan with the Georgia
PSC. Reference is made to Note (G) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K for additional information.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     On July 31, 2001, GEORGIA transferred ownership of the Plant Dahlberg
generating units at net book value to Southern Power Company, an affiliated
company.

     On March 14, 2001, the FERC rejected certain elements of SOUTHERN's RTO
proposal. For additional information on the FERC's response to SOUTHERN's
proposal, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Integrated Southeast
Utilities" in the Form 10-K. Following the March 14, 2001 order, SOUTHERN
submitted a series of status reports informing the FERC of progress toward the
development of a Southeastern RTO. In these status reports, SOUTHERN explained
that it has entered into memoranda of understanding to develop an RTO with eight
non-jurisdictional cooperative and public power entities. In addition, SOUTHERN
has entered into a memorandum of understanding with TVA to address coordination
issues between their transmission systems. On July 12, 2001, the FERC issued an
order on the status reports of SOUTHERN, as well as GridSouth and
Entergy/Southwest Power Pool. In those orders, the FERC indicated that it
favored a single RTO for the Southeast. The FERC initiated a mediation process,
directed the parties to participate in the mediation for 45 days and ordered the
mediator to file a report within 10 days following the end of the mediation.
These discussions are ongoing and it is expected that the mediator will make a
report by mid-September 2001.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings. For additional information, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the
Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (C) through (H), (K) and (M) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, GEORGIA adopted FASB Statement No. 133, as amended,
and changed the method of accounting for derivative instruments. All derivatives
are now reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair market
value. Reference is made to Note (C) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information on the adoption of Statement No.
133.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations,"
which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for business
combinations and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16.
All business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 must now be accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting.

     Also in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17.
It addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a
group of other assets (but not those acquired in a business combination) should
be accounted for upon acquisition and on an ongoing basis. Goodwill and
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but
rather will be tested at least annually for impairment. Intangible assets that
have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives,
which are no longer limited to 40 years. The provisions of Statement No. 142
must be adopted in 2002. GEORGIA has not yet quantified the impact of adopting
Statement No. 142 on its financial statements; however, the impact is not
expected to be material.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Additionally in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset
Retirement Obligations," which establishes new accounting and reporting
standards for legal obligations associated with retiring assets, including
decommissioning nuclear plants. The fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation must be recorded in the period in which it is incurred,
with the cost capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting
from the passage of time will be recognized as operating expenses. Statement No.
143 must be adopted by 2003. GEORGIA has not yet quantified the impact of
adopting Statement No. 143 on its financial statements. Reference is made to
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN,
ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial statements of
SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA under "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning"
in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first six months of
2001 was the addition of approximately $740.2 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. See GEORGIA's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

In February 2001, GEORGIA issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of
senior notes consisting of $200 million of Series F 5.75% Senior Notes due
January 31, 2003 and $150 million of Series G 6.20% Senior Notes due February 1,
2006. The proceeds of the sale were applied to redeem $200 million outstanding
principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds, 6 5/8% Series due April 2003 and to
repay a portion of GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness. Also in
February 2001, GEORGIA issued $100 million of Series H 6.70% Senior Insured
Quarterly Notes due March 1, 2011. The proceeds of this sale were used to repay
an additional portion of GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     In May 2001, GEORGIA issued $150 million of Series I 5.25% Senior Notes due
May 8, 2003. The proceeds of this sale were used in May 2001 to repurchase $47
million aggregate principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds, 7.70% Series due May
1, 2025, $1.9 million aggregate principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds, 6 7/8%
Series due April 1, 2008 and $8.1 million aggregate principal amount of First
Mortgage Bonds, 6.07% Series due December 1, 2005, and to redeem in June 2001
$75 million outstanding principal amount of GEORGIA's First Mortgage Bonds,
6.35% Series due August 1, 2003. The remainder was used to repay a portion of
GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     In July 2001, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, an aggregate
principal amount of $58.8 million of pollution control revenue bonds due July 1,
2031. Also in July 2001, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, $67 million
of pollution control revenue bonds due July 1, 2016. The proceeds of these sales
are being used to redeem various series of outstanding pollution control revenue
bonds.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Issues" in the
Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital requirements for its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at June 30,
2001 approximately $15.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$1.765 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. The credit arrangements
provide liquidity support to GEORGIA's obligations with respect to variable rate
pollution control bonds and its commercial paper program. GEORGIA may also meet
short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to issue and sell
commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of GEORGIA and other
SOUTHERN subsidiaries. At June 30, 2001, GEORGIA had outstanding $86.2 million
of notes payable and $711.2 million of commercial paper. Management believes

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter and
year-to-date 2001 was $14.8 million and $25.0 million, respectively, compared to
$12.9 million and $17.6 million for the same periods in 2000. The second quarter
2001 earnings were higher by $1.8 million or 14.3% due primarily to a reduction
in interest expense, an increase in allowance for equity funds used during
construction and the discontinuance of the appliance sales division.
Year-to-date 2001 earnings increased by $7.4 million or 42% due primarily to
higher operating revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

     Retail sales. Excluding the recovery of fuel expense and certain other
expenses that do not affect net income, retail sales decreased slightly $0.2
million or 0.2% for the second quarter 2001 and increased $6.3 million or 4.1%
year-to-date 2001. The year-to-date 2001 increase in retail sales revenue was
primarily due to a 6.2% increase in retail energy sales which is attributed to
favorable weather conditions and growth in the number of customers served by
GULF.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. In the second quarter and year-to-date
2001, sales for resale to non-affiliates increased primarily as a result of
increased unit power energy sales. These transactions do not have a significant
impact on earnings since the energy is usually sold at variable cost.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. The second quarter and year-to-date 2001 increases resulted
from fuel clause adjustments made to other operating revenues to reflect the
difference between recoverable costs and the amounts actually reflected in
current rates. The recovery provisions generally equal the related expenses and
have no material effect on net income.

     Fuel expense. Fuel expense in the second quarter of 2001 was down due to
less generation related to reduced demand for energy by retail customers when
compared to the same period in 2000. The year-to-date 2001 fuel expense increase
is a result of increased fuel prices for the first half of 2001 compared to 2000
and increased generation during the first quarter 2001 that was partially offset
in the second quarter 2001 by reduced generation. Since energy expenses are
generally offset by energy revenues, these expenses do not have a significant
impact on net income.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. The increases for the second quarter and
year-to-date 2001 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2000 are
primarily attributed to an increase in energy purchases to meet the demand for
energy by wholesale customers. Since energy expenses are generally offset by
energy revenues, these expenses do not have a significant impact on net income.

     Maintenance expense. For the second quarter and year-to-date 2001,
maintenance expense was down when compared to the same periods in 2000 due
primarily to higher turbine outage expenses and special projects performed in
the first half of 2000.

     Other, net. The second quarter and year-to-date 2001 increases when
compared to the corresponding periods in 2000 are mainly due to higher allowance
for equity funds used during construction for the current year related to the
construction of GULF's new combined cycle unit, partially offset by higher
expenses related to the discontinuance of GULF's appliance sales division for
the same periods in 2000.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GULF is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     In 1999, the Florida PSC approved GULF's plan to reduce its authorized rate
of return, reduce retail base rates and share revenues with its customers. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     On March 14, 2001, the FERC rejected certain elements of SOUTHERN's RTO
proposal. For additional information on the FERC's response to SOUTHERN's
proposal, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Integrated Southeast
Utilities" in the Form 10-K. Following the March 14, 2001 order, SOUTHERN
submitted a series of status reports informing the FERC of progress toward the
development of a Southeastern RTO. In these status reports, SOUTHERN explained
that it has entered into memoranda of understanding to develop an RTO with eight
non-jurisdictional cooperative and public power entities. In addition, SOUTHERN
has entered into a memorandum of understanding with TVA to address coordination
issues between their transmission systems. On July 12, 2001, the FERC issued an
order on the status reports of SOUTHERN, as well as GridSouth and
Entergy/Southwest Power Pool. In those orders, the FERC indicated that it
favored a single RTO for the Southeast. The FERC initiated a mediation process,
directed the parties to participate in the mediation for 45 days and ordered the
mediator to file a report within 10 days following the end of the mediation.
These discussions are ongoing and it is expected that the mediator will make a
report by mid-September 2001.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of GULF in the
Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     Reference is made to Notes (C) through (F) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, GULF adopted FASB Statement No. 133, as amended, and
changed the method of accounting for derivative instruments. All derivatives are
now reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair market value.
Reference is made to Note (C) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information on the adoption of Statement No.
133.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations,"
which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for business
combinations and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16.
All business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 must now be accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting.

     Also in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17.
It addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a
group of other assets (but not those acquired in a business combination) should
be accounted for upon acquisition and on an ongoing basis. Goodwill and
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but
rather will be tested at least annually for impairment. Intangible assets that
have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives,
which are no longer limited to 40 years. The provisions of Statement No. 142
must be adopted in 2002. GULF has not yet quantified the impact of adopting
Statement No. 142 on its financial statements; however, the impact is not
expected to be material.

     Additionally in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset
Retirement Obligations," which establishes new accounting and reporting
standards for legal obligations associated with retiring assets, including
decommissioning nuclear plants. The fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation must be recorded in the period in which it is incurred,
with the cost capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting
from the passage of time will be

recognized as operating expenses.  Statement No. 143 must be adopted by 2003.
GULF has not yet quantified the impact of adopting Statement No. 143 on its
financial statements.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first six months of 2001
included the addition of approximately $163 million to utility plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations, capital contributions from SOUTHERN and short-term indebtedness. See
GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

On August 3, 2001, GULF issued $60 million of Series C 4.69% Senior Notes due
August 1, 2003. The proceeds of the sale will be used to redeem $30 million
outstanding principal amount of GULF's First Mortgage Bonds, 6 1/8% Series due
July 1, 2003 and to repay a portion of GULF's short-term indebtedness. GULF
plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt
and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital Requirements for Construction" and "Environmental Matters" in the Form
10-K for a description of GULF's capital requirements for its construction
program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at June 30, 2001
approximately $2.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $123 million of
unused committed lines of credit with banks. The credit arrangements provide
liquidity support to GULF's obligations with respect to variable rate pollution
control bonds and commercial paper. GULF may also meet short-term cash needs
through a SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at
the request and for the benefit of GULF and other SOUTHERN subsidiaries. At June
30, 2001, GULF had $58 million of notes payable to banks and $58.2 million of
commercial paper. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

2000. The increases in earnings of $4.3 million or 35.5% and $7.4 million or

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue was down by $1.2 million or 1.6% in the second
quarter 2001 and $0.3 million or 0.3% year-to-date 2001 when compared to the
corresponding periods in 2000 due to lower retail energy sales. Decreases in
retail energy sales of 2.7% in the second quarter of 2001 and 1.9% year-to-date
2001 are largely due to mild weather.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. This item increased during the second
quarter and year-to-date 2001 when compared to the same periods in 2000 as a
result of increased demand for energy by non-affiliates and additional power
sales as a result of the commercial operation of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. For the second quarter and year-to-date 2001, fuel expense
was higher when compared to the same periods in 2000 due mostly to increased
generation to meet energy demands and higher cost of fuel.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. This expense increased during the second
quarter and year-to-date 2001 primarily as a result of the need to meet higher
demand for energy. These transactions do not have a significant impact on net
income since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues.

     Other operation expense. The second quarter and year-to-date 2001 increases
are related to the commercial operation of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4.

     Maintenance expense. This expense decreased in the second quarter and
year-to-date 2001 due primarily to the timing of maintenance work to be
performed during 2001.

     Taxes other than income taxes. For the second quarter and year-to-date
2001, taxes other than income taxes decreased when compared to the same periods
in 2000 due primarily to lower ad valorem taxes.

     Other income. For the second quarter and year-to-date 2001, other, net
increased when compared to the same periods in 2000 as a result of project work
completed in the second quarter 2001.

     Interest expense, net. Interest expenses are lower for the second quarter
and year-to-date as a result of lower interest rates on debt outstanding.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters, the effect of weather, and the economy on
energy sales. On August 3, 2001, MISSISSIPPI filed a request with the
Mississippi PSC to increase annual retail rate revenues by approximately $46.4
million. The requested increase would take effect in January 2002. As a result
of the filing, the Mississippi PSC suspended the operation of MISSISSIPPI's
formula rate plan until an order is issued on MISSISSIPPI's request. The
Mississippi PSC is required to rule on MISSISSIPPI'S request in December 2001.
For additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, MISSISSIPPI is positioning
the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form
10-K.

     MISSISSIPPI's 2001 ECO Plan filing was approved, as filed, by the
Mississippi PSC on March 7, 2001 and resulted in a slight increase in customer
prices. Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if
such costs cannot be recovered. For additional information about the Clean Air
Act and other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     On March 14, 2001, the FERC rejected certain elements of SOUTHERN's RTO
proposal. For additional information on the FERC's response to SOUTHERN's
proposal, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Integrated Southeast
Utilities" in the Form 10-K. Following the March 14, 2001 order, SOUTHERN
submitted a series of status reports informing the FERC of progress toward the
development of a Southeastern RTO. In these status reports, SOUTHERN explained
that it has entered into memoranda of understanding to develop an RTO with eight
non-jurisdictional cooperative and public power entities. In addition, SOUTHERN

has entered into a memorandum of understanding with TVA to address coordination
issues between their transmission systems. On July 12, 2001, the FERC issued an
order on the status reports of SOUTHERN, as well as GridSouth and
Entergy/Southwest Power Pool. In those orders, the FERC indicated that it
favored a single RTO for the Southeast. The FERC initiated a mediation process,
directed the parties to participate in the mediation for 45 days and ordered the
mediator to file a report within 10 days following the end of the mediation.
These discussions are ongoing and it is expected that the mediator will make a
report by mid-September 2001.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in
the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     Reference is made to Notes (C) through (F) and (L) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, MISSISSIPPI adopted FASB Statement No. 133, as
amended, and changed the method of accounting for derivative instruments. All
derivatives are now reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at
fair market value. Reference is made to Note (C) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for additional information on the adoption of
Statement No. 133.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations,"
which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for business
combinations and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16.
All business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 must now be accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting.

     Also in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17.
It addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a
group of other assets (but not those acquired in a business combination) should
be accounted for upon acquisition and on an ongoing basis. Goodwill and
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but
rather will be tested at least annually for impairment. Intangible assets that
have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives,
which are no longer limited to 40 years. The provisions of Statement No. 142
must be adopted in 2002. MISSISSIPPI has not yet quantified the impact of
adopting Statement No. 142 on its financial statements; however, the impact is
not expected to be material.

     Additionally in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset
Retirement Obligations," which establishes new accounting and reporting
standards for legal obligations associated with retiring assets, including
decommissioning nuclear plants. The fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation must be recorded in the period in which it is incurred,
with the cost capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting
from the passage of time will be recognized as operating expenses. Statement No.
143 must be adopted by 2003. MISSISSIPPI has not yet quantified the impact of
adopting Statement No. 143 on its financial statements.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first six months
of 2001 included the addition of approximately $23 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations and financing activities. See MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Statements
of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Financing
Activity" and Note 4 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in the Form
10-K. Effective May 4, 2001, in connection with commercial operation of a
1,064-megawatt natural gas combined cycle facility, MISSISSIPPI entered into the
initial 10-year lease term with Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership. The
final completion cost will be approximately $370 million. Reference is made to
Note (L) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for
additional information.

     MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" and Note 3 to the financial statements
in the Form 10-K for a description of MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its
construction program, environmental compliance efforts, sinking fund
requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at June
30, 2001 approximately $10.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $124.3 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks.
The credit arrangements provide liquidity support to MISSISSIPPI's obligation
with respect to variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper.
MISSISSIPPI may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit
of MISSISSIPPI and other SOUTHERN subsidiaries. At June 30, 2001, MISSISSIPPI
had outstanding $23.0 million of notes payable to banks and $55.7 million of
commercial paper. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income for the second quarter and year-to-date 2001 was $6.2
million and $7.7 million, respectively, as compared to $6.3 million and $7.9
million for the corresponding periods of 2000. Earnings were flat in the second
quarter 2001 and down slightly year-to-date 2001, reflecting higher operating
revenues that were fully offset by higher operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which do not affect net income,
retail sales revenue decreased by $0.3 million or 0.8% for the second quarter of
2001 and increased by $1.1 million or 1.5% year-to-date 2001 when compared to
the same periods in 2000. For the second quarter 2001, retail sales revenue
decreased primarily due to a 6.6% decrease in energy sales in the industrial
sector. Industrial energy sales were affected by reduced demand from one
industrial customer in the second quarter of 2001. The year-to-date 2001
increase in retail sales revenue is attributed to a 2.9% increase in energy
sales to retail customers spurred by growth in the number of customers served by
SAVANNAH, offset somewhat by the decrease in industrial sales.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. The second quarter and year-to-date 2001
increases are primarily due to more energy sales to non-affiliated wholesale
customers than were recorded in the same periods in 2000. These transactions do
not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is usually sold at
variable cost.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. Fuel expense was lower in the second quarter and year-to-date
2001 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2000 as a result of reduced
generation and lower average cost of fuel consumed.

                       SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power - non-affiliates. The second quarter and year-to-date 2001
increases are due primarily to higher costs associated with these energy
purchases. These transactions do not have a significant impact on net income
since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues.

     Maintenance expense. During the second quarter of 2001, this expense was
lower due mainly to an unscheduled maintenance outage and a boiler outage during
the same period in 2000. The year-to-date 2001 increase is attributed to a
scheduled major maintenance outage at one of SAVANNAH's plants.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SAVANNAH is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     On March 14, 2001, the FERC rejected certain elements of SOUTHERN's RTO
proposal. For additional information on the FERC's response to SOUTHERN's
proposal, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Integrated Southeast
Utilities" in the Form 10-K. Following the March 14, 2001 order, SOUTHERN
submitted a series of status reports informing the FERC of progress toward the
development of a Southeastern RTO. In these status reports, SOUTHERN explained
that it has entered into memoranda of understanding to develop an RTO with eight
non-jurisdictional cooperative and public power entities. In addition, SOUTHERN
has entered into a memorandum of understanding with TVA to address coordination
issues between their transmission systems. On July 12, 2001, the FERC issued an
order on the status reports of SOUTHERN, as well as GridSouth and
Entergy/Southwest Power Pool. In those orders, the FERC indicated that it
favored a single RTO for the Southeast. The FERC initiated a mediation process,
directed the parties to participate in the mediation for 45 days and ordered the
mediator to file a report within 10 days following the end of the mediation.
These discussions are ongoing and it is expected that the mediator will make a
report by mid-September 2001.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, SAVANNAH adopted FASB Statement No. 133, as amended,
and changed the method of accounting for derivative instruments. All derivatives
are now reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair market
value. Reference is made to Note (C) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information on the adoption of Statement No.
133.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations,"
which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for business
combinations and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16.
All business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 must now be accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting.

     Also in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17.
It addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a
group of other assets (but not those acquired in a business combination) should
be accounted for upon acquisition and on an ongoing basis. Goodwill and
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but
rather will be tested at least annually for impairment. Intangible assets that
have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives,
which are no longer limited to 40 years. The provisions of Statement No. 142
must be adopted in 2002. SAVANNAH has not yet quantified the impact of adopting
Statement No. 142 on its financial statements; however, the impact is not
expected to be material.

     Additionally in June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Asset
Retirement Obligations," which establishes new accounting and reporting
standards for legal obligations associated with retiring assets, including
decommissioning nuclear plants. The fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation must be recorded in the period in which it is incurred,
with the cost capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
depreciated over the asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting
from the passage of time will be recognized as operating expenses. Statement No.
143 must be adopted by 2003. SAVANNAH has not yet quantified the impact of
adopting Statement No. 143 on its financial statements.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first six months of
2001 included the addition of approximately $18 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations, credit arrangements with banks and financings. See SAVANNAH's
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Financing Activities

In May 2001, SAVANNAH issued $65 million aggregate principal amount of senior
notes consisting of $20 million of Series B 5.12% Senior Notes due May 15, 2003
and $45 million of Series C 6.55% Senior Notes due May 15, 2008. The proceeds of
the sale were used to redeem in June 2001 the $20 million outstanding principal
amount of SAVANNAH's First Mortgage Bonds, 6 3/8% Series due July 1, 2003 and to
repay $30 million in bank loans and a portion of SAVANNAH's outstanding
short-term indebtedness.

     SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at June 30,
2001 approximately $4.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$65.5 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks. The credit
arrangements provide liquidity support to SAVANNAH's obligation with respect to
variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper. SAVANNAH may also
meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to issue and
sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of SAVANNAH and other
SOUTHERN subsidiaries. At June 30, 2001, SAVANNAH had outstanding $20.8 million
of notes payable to banks and $30.1 million of commercial paper. Since SAVANNAH
has no major generating plants under construction, management believes that the
need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)   The condensed financial statements of the registrants included herein
      have been prepared by each registrant, without audit,
      pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.  In the opinion of
      each registrant's management, the information regarding
      such registrant furnished herein reflects all adjustments necessary to
      present fairly the results of operations for the periods
      ended June 30, 2001 and 2000.  Certain information and footnote
      disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
      in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
      United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such
      rules and regulations, although each registrant believes that the
      disclosures regarding such registrant are adequate to make the
      information presented not misleading.  It is suggested that these
      condensed financial statements of each registrant be read in
      conjunction with the financial statements of such registrant and the
      notes thereto included in the Form 10-K.  Certain prior
      period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period
      presentation.  Due to seasonal variations in the demand for
      energy, operating results for the periods presented do not necessarily
      indicate operating results for the entire year.

(B)   Reference is made to Note 11 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in
      Item 8 and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Overview of
      Consolidated Earnings" and "Discontinued Operations" of SOUTHERN in Item 7
      of the Form 10-K for information on the spin off of Mirant.

      On April 2, 2001, SOUTHERN completed the spin off of Mirant with a tax
      free distribution to SOUTHERN's shareholders of its remaining ownership of
      272 million Mirant shares. Shares from the spin off were distributed at a
      ratio of approximately 0.4 share of Mirant common stock for every share of
      SOUTHERN common stock held at the record date. The distribution resulted
      in charges of approximately $3,323 million and $260 million to SOUTHERN's
      paid-in capital and retained earnings, respectively.

      As a result of the spin off, SOUTHERN's financial statements reflect
      Mirant as discontinued operations. All historical financial statements
      presented and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to this
      presentation, with the historical assets and liabilities of Mirant
      presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as net assets of
      discontinued operations.

(C)   On January 1, 2001, SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries adopted FASB Statement
      No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"
      as amended. Statement No. 133 requires that certain derivative instruments
      be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured
      at fair value and that changes in the fair value be recognized currently
      in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

      SOUTHERN utilizes financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes
      in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Such financial
      instruments are generally structured so that their terms are substantially
      identical to (and their changes in market value are highly correlated to)
      those of SOUTHERN's recorded liabilities or unrecorded firm commitments.
      Thus, these instruments generally qualify as hedges under Statement No.
      133.


                                       67

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


      The integrated Southeast utilities also enter into commodity related
      forward and option contracts to limit exposure to changing prices on
      certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales. Substantially
      all of the integrated Southeast utilities' bulk energy purchases and sales
      meet the definition of a derivative under Statement No. 133. In many
      cases, these transactions meet Statement No. 133's normal purchase and
      sale exception and the related contracts are accounted for under the
      accrual method. Certain of these contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of
      anticipated transactions, resulting in the deferral of related gains and
      losses in other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur.
      Any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in net income. Certain other
      contracts do not meet the hedge requirements and are marked to market
      through current period income.

      The cumulative effect of adoption was a reduction of approximately $300
      million in comprehensive income, which was all related to discontinued
      operations. The impact on net income was immaterial and less than $0.01
      per share to each of the integrated Southeast utilities individually, as
      well as to SOUTHERN on a consolidated basis. The mark to market
      adjustments recorded during the second quarter of 2001 were also
      immaterial. However, the application and interpretation of Statement No.
      133's requirements are still evolving and further guidance from the FASB
      is expected, which could further impact the financial statements of
      SOUTHERN and the integrated Southeast utilities. Also, as wholesale energy
      markets mature, the accounting for future transactions could be
      significantly impacted by Statement No. 133, resulting in more volatility
      in net income and comprehensive income.

      Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Market Price
      Risk" of SOUTHERN and the integrated Southeast utilities in Item 7 for
      each of the registrants in the Form 10-K, and Note 1 to the financial
      statements of SOUTHERN under the caption "Financial Instruments for
      Non-Trading Activities" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)   SOUTHERN, ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH engage in price
      risk management activities. Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
      AND ANALYSIS - "Market Price Risk" in SOUTHERN; and "Exposure to Market
      Risks," in ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH. Reference is
      also made to Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a discussion of these activities.

      In May 2001, the Georgia PSC ordered that SAVANNAH implement a natural
      gas/oil hedging program to become effective June 1, 2001. In June 2001,
      the Mississippi PSC approved MISSISSIPPI's Energy Cost Management Clause
      to become effective June 1, 2001. These programs have been designed as a
      means to mitigate the effects of volatile fuel prices and to better match
      the cost recovery of fuel and energy related transactions.

(E)   The integrated Southeast utilities are subject to the provisions of FASB
      Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
      Regulation. In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no
      longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
      off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
      recoverable, and determine if any other assets have been impaired. For
      additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements of each
      registrant in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(F)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN,
      ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for information on EPA litigation.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(G)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information concerning a
      three-year rate order approved by the Georgia PSC effective
      January 1, 1999. The order decreased annual retail rates by $262 million
      effective January 1, 1999 and by an additional $24 million effective
      January 1, 2000.  The order further provides for $85 million each year,
      plus up to $50 million annually of any earnings above a 12.5% retail
      return on common equity during the second and third years, to be applied
      to accelerated amortization or depreciation of assets.  In May 2000, the
      Georgia PSC ordered that these funds be maintained in a regulatory
      liability account and that interest be accrued on the account
      at the prime rate.  These amounts are reflected on the balance sheets in
      deferred credits and other liabilities, other.  Two-thirds of any
      additional earnings above the 12.5% return will be applied to rate
      reductions and the remaining one-third retained by GEORGIA.  Pursuant to
      this provision, GEORGIA recognized accelerated amortization of  $11.6
      million in the second quarter of 2001 and $51.3 million in the second
      quarter of 2000 and $49.2 million year-to-date 2001 and $87.9 million
      year-to-date 2000.

      Pursuant to GEORGIA's existing rate order, GEORGIA was required to file a
      general rate case with the Georgia PSC by July 1, 2001. Accordingly, on
      June 29, 2001, GEORGIA filed a rate plan with the Georgia PSC. GEORGIA's
      filing showed a base rate revenue deficiency of $103 million for the test
      period. GEORGIA's rate plan proposal waives the base rate increase in
      favor of a five-year plan that includes several modifications to the
      existing rate order. GEORGIA requested to continue operating within an
      earnings band, but requested that the mid-point of the band be increased
      by 100 basis points, to a range of between 11% and 13.5 % return on
      equity. As part of the proposal, GEORGIA also requested a continuation of
      the sharing mechanism that was approved in 1998. The new proposal would
      allow customers to keep two-thirds of any amount above the earnings range
      that can be attributed to weather, while GEORGIA would keep one-third.
      GEORGIA and its customers would each keep half of all other earnings above
      the range. GEORGIA also proposed a certified capacity cost recovery clause
      that would become effective on June 1, 2002. The Georgia PSC is expected
      to issue its decision by December 20, 2001 to be effective January 1,
      2002. There can be no assurance that the plan, as submitted by GEORGIA,
      will be approved by the Georgia PSC.

(H)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
      designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
      Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
      environmental contingencies.

(I)   SOUTHERN has made separate guarantees to certain counterparties regarding
      performance of contractual commitments by Mirant's trading and marketing
      subsidiaries. At June 30, 2001, the total notional amount of guarantees
      was $96 million and the estimated fair value of net contractual
      commitments outstanding was approximately $17.3 million. Based upon a
      statistical analysis of credit risk, SOUTHERN's potential exposure under
      these contractual commitments would not materially differ from the
      estimated fair value. Subsequent to the spin off, Mirant began paying
      SOUTHERN a monthly fee of 1 percent on the average aggregate maximum
      principal amount of all guarantees outstanding until they are replaced or
      expire. Mirant must use reasonable efforts to release SOUTHERN from all
      such support arrangements and will indemnify SOUTHERN for any obligations
      incurred.

      Reference is made to Note 9 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN under
      the caption "Guarantees" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(J)   With respect to Mobile Energy, reference is made to Note 3 to the
      financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 and to Legal Proceedings in
      Item 3 of the Form 10-K for information relating to (i) petitions for
      Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief which were filed in the U. S. Bankruptcy
      Court for the Southern District of Alabama and (ii) proposed settlement
      discussions among the affected parties.

(K)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in
      Item 8 and to Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of the Form 10-K for
      information relating to various lawsuits.

(L)  Effective  May 4, 2001,  in  connection  with  commercial  operation of the
     1,064-megawatt  natural gas combined cycle facility at MISSISSIPPI's  Plant
     Daniel (the "Facility"), MISSISSIPPI entered into the initial 10-year lease
     term under its lease  arrangement for the Facility with Escatawpa  Funding,
     Limited  Partnership.  The final completion cost will be approximately $370
     million.  The lease provides for a residual value guarantee  (approximately
     71% of the acquisition cost) by MISSISSIPPI that is due upon termination of
     the lease in certain  circumstances.  The lease also includes  purchase and
     renewal options.  Upon  termination of the lease, at MISSISSIPPI's  option,
     MISSISSIPPI  may either exercise its purchase option or the facility can be
     sold to a third  party.  MISSISSIPPI  expects the fair market  value of the
     leased facility to substantially reduce or eliminate  MISSISSIPPI's payment
     under the residual  value  guarantee.  The annual amount of future  minimum
     operating lease payments exclusive of any payment related to this guarantee
     will approximate $30 million during the initial term.

(M)  In April 2001,  SAVANNAH  received  an order from the Georgia PSC  allowing
     SAVANNAH to set the fuel cost  recovery  rate to recover its  approximately
     $40  million  deferred  fuel  balance  over  three  years  and  to  recover
     approximately  $137 million in projected  annual fuel and  purchased  power
     costs,  for a total  recovery  of about $150  million  per year.  The order
     "capped"  energy  strip  purchases  at  $100  per  megawatt.  Any  purchase
     agreement for summer  energy strips priced in excess of the "cap"  requires
     that the amount  above $100 per  megawatt  be  "imputed"  as  capacity  and
     recovered  through  non-fuel  rates. In a  reconsideration  of the SAVANNAH
     order,  decided in a June 11, 2001 Administrative  Session, the Georgia PSC
     ordered that all costs for energy  purchases  contracted for prior to April
     30, 2001 may be recovered through the fuel clause. In May 2001, the Georgia
     PSC  approved  an  increase  to the retail  fuel rate  allowing  GEORGIA to
     recover $87 million of unrecovered fuel costs over the next 24 months.

(N)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to retail rate
      adjustment procedures. Effective July 2001, retail rates were adjusted
      under Rate CNP, Certificated New Plant, which allows ALABAMA to begin to
      recover costs for a new generating plant after it goes into commercial
      operation. ALABAMA placed Plant Barry, Unit 7 into commercial operation on
      May 1, 2001.

Item 5.          Other Information.

                 Historically, the price for shares purchased from SOUTHERN
                 under the Southern Investment Plan was calculated as the
                 average of the high and low sale prices as reported on the NYSE
                 Composite Transactions as published by The Wall Street Journal.
                 On April 30, 2001, The Wall Street Journal ceased reporting
                 such high and low sales prices. Accordingly, effective April
                 30, 2001, the price for shares purchased under the Southern
                 Investment Plan is calculated as the average of the high and
                 low sales prices on the NYSE Composite Transactions as reported
                 to SOUTHERN by the NYSENET or, if the NYSENET is unavailable to
                 SOUTHERN for any reason, as reported to SOUTHERN by the New
                 York Stock Exchange or by such other sources as SOUTHERN deems
                 accurate.

                                                         (SOUTHERN COMPANY LOGO)
                                                                   April 6, 2001

                       IMPORTANT U. S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
                         INFORMATION FOR MIRANT SPIN-OFF

To Southern Company Stockholders of Record as of March 21, 2001:

    Owners of Southern Company ("Southern Company") common stock on the March
21, 2001 Record Date received a distribution of 0.397614 shares of Mirant
Corporation ("Mirant") common stock for each share of Southern Company common
stock owned on the Record Date. The distribution was made on April 2, 2001, at
5:00 p.m., Eastern Time.

    Southern Company has received a private letter ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service stating that, based on representations made by Southern Company,
the distribution of whole shares of Mirant common stock will be tax-free for U.
S. federal income tax purposes for Southern Company stockholders who are United
States citizens or residents. The tax basis of your Southern Company common
stock WILL, however, have to be apportioned between your Southern Company common
stock and your Mirant common stock.

TAX BASIS

    To properly account for the distribution, you should determine the tax basis
of your current Southern Company shares, if you have not already done so.

    - If you acquired your Southern Company shares by purchasing them, tax basis
      refers to the sum of: (1) the amount of your initial purchase (including
      commissions); (2) the amount of dividends reinvested (including
      commissions); and (3) the amount of optional cash payments (including
      commissions). This type of information can be found on bank or brokerage
      statements, dividend reinvestment statements, purchase confirmations, or
      your personal records.

    - If you did not actually purchase your Southern Company shares, such as
      receiving the shares as a gift or an inheritance, consult with your tax
      advisor to determine your tax basis.

TAX BASIS ALLOCATION BETWEEN SOUTHERN COMPANY AND MIRANT

    Your tax basis for the Mirant common stock received in the spin-off will be
determined based on your tax basis in the Southern Company common stock with
respect to which your distribution of Mirant common stock was made. After you
determine your tax basis, you should allocate it between Southern Company common
stock and the Mirant common stock received in the distribution.

    One such method is to allocate the tax basis in your shares of Southern
Company common stock immediately prior to the spin-off between your Southern
Company common stock and Mirant common stock in proportion to the fair market
value of Southern Company common stock and Mirant common stock at market close
on April 2, 2001, the last trading day before the distribution. The closing
price per share for Southern Company WI (without the distribution) on April 2,
2001 was $21.60. The closing price per share for Mirant WI on April 2, 2001 was
$34.60.

    Using this methodology, and the 0.397614 distribution ratio, 61.09% of your
basis would be allocated to Southern Company common stock, and the remaining
38.91% would be allocated to the shares of Mirant common stock you received in
the distribution (including any fractional share interest). You should consult
your tax advisor regarding the application of this calculation to your
particular circumstances. See the example that follows.

EXAMPLE:

    100 shares of Southern Company common stock were purchased at $20 per share,
resulting in a tax basis of $2,000. Because the spin-off distribution ratio was
0.397614, the owner was entitled to 39.7614 Mirant shares for the 100 shares of
Southern Company owned. The owner received 39 full shares of Mirant in
book-entry form and a check for the sale of the 0.7614 fractional share. The tax
basis of a fractional share is proportional to the basis of a whole share. Using
the tax basis allocation percentages, 61.09% of the $2,000 is allocated to
Southern Company common stock and 38.91% to Mirant common stock. See the chart
that follows.

EXAMPLE:

    The per share tax basis would then be obtained by dividing the new tax basis
by the number of shares, as follows:

          $1,221.80                          100                            $12.22
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        MIR TAX BASIS                  NUMBER OF SHARES              MIR PER SHARE BASIS
           $778.20                         39.7614                          $19.57
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</Table>

    If you acquired Southern Company shares on more than one occasion, you will
need to perform this calculation separately for each group of shares.

FRACTIONAL SHARE SALE

    The receipt of cash resulting from the sale of a fractional share will
result in the recognition of gain or loss for U. S. federal income tax purposes.
This is measured by the difference between the cash you receive for such
fractional share and your tax basis in such fractional share.

    The following illustration uses the information in the example above. Assume
the fractional share of 0.7614 was sold for $35.00 net per share and you
received a check for $26.65 (0.7614 times $35.00 = $26.65).

                           (FRACTIONAL SHARE GRAPHIC)

HOLDING PERIOD

    The holding period for capital gains purposes of shares of Mirant common
stock received in the distribution will include the holding period of Southern
Company common stock on which the distribution was made, provided the
stockholder holds the Southern Company common stock as a capital asset on the
Distribution Date.

RETAIN THIS INFORMATION

    You should retain this information to support the determination of your tax
basis in your Southern Company and Mirant shares. Tax regulations require that
you attach to your U.S. federal income tax return for the year in which the
Mirant shares were received -- 2001 -- a statement setting forth certain
prescribed information about the distribution. In order to assist you in
complying with this tax requirement, we are attaching a sample form of a
statement to be completed by you and filed with your 2001 federal income tax
return.

CONSULT TAX ADVISOR

    The information in this letter represents our understanding of existing U.S.
federal income tax law and does not constitute tax advice. It does not purport
to address all tax considerations relating to the distribution or to describe
tax consequences that may apply to particular categories of stockholders. You
should consult your tax advisor as to the particular tax consequences to you of
the distribution, including the applicability and effect of any state, local and
foreign tax laws.

                                                                   April 6, 2001
