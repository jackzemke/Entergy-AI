RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

     SOUTHERN's  consolidated net income for the second quarter and year-to-date
1997 was $215  million  ($0.31 per share) and $402  million  ($0.59 per  share),
respectively, compared to $287 million ($0.43 per share) and $520 million ($0.78
per share) for the corresponding  periods of 1996. This 25.2% and 22.7% decrease
in earnings for the quarter and year-to-date 1997, respectively,  was mainly due
to  the   milder-than-normal   weather  in  the  operating   companies'  service
territories.  

     SOUTHERN's  traditional core business is primarily  represented by
its five domestic electric utility operating  companies,  which provide electric
service in four Southeastern  states.  Another significant portion of SOUTHERN's
business  is its  non-traditional  business  primarily  represented  by Southern
Energy,  which  owns and  manages  international  and  domestic  businesses  for
SOUTHERN.  Businesses  acquired  by Southern  Energy  have been  included in the
consolidated statements of income since the date of acquisition. Certain changes
in operating  revenues and expenses from the prior period are the result of such
acquisitions.  

     Significant  income  statement  items  appropriate for discussion

                 THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Operating revenues. Operating revenues for the traditional core business
for the second quarter decreased $159 million or 7.2% and year-to-date decreased
$240 million or 5.7%, compared to the same periods of 1996. Operating revenues
for non-traditional business were up $312 million or 85.6% for the quarter and
$549 million or 69.2% for year-to-date. The decrease in traditional core
revenues was mainly due to decreases of 4.8% and 3.1% for the quarter and
year-to-date, respectively, in the amount of energy sold as a result of
milder-than-normal temperatures. Energy sales to residential customers showed a
15.0% decrease for the quarter and a 12.3% decrease year-to-date, as further
evidence of the effect of milder weather. The increase in non-traditional
operating revenues was primarily attributable to increased sales by Southern
Energy's energy marketing organization. These revenues were $273 million and
$430 million for the current quarter and year-to-date 1997, respectively.

     Purchased power expense. For the traditional core business, purchased power
expenses were down 31.1% and 33.1% for the quarter and year-to-date,
respectively, as a result of the milder temperatures throughout the Southern
electric system. For the non-traditional business, purchased power expenses were
up 145.6% and 115.9% for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, due
primarily to increases on purchases in connection with Southern Energy's energy
marketing activities. These purchases increased $266 million and $422 million
for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. 

     Depreciation and amortization expense. The increases in depreciation and 
amortization expense of the traditional core business for the quarter and 
year-to-date compared to the same periods in 1996, can be attributed primarily
to an $8 million and $28 million charge for the quarter and year-to-date 1997 
pursuant to GEORGIA's retail accounting order as discussed in Note (L) in the 
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein. Further, additions to 
utility plant contributed to the increase in depreciation and amortization for 
the quarter and year-to-date 1997. For the non-traditional business, 
depreciation and amortization increased by $22.3 million and $39.4 million fo
the quarter and year-to-date, compared to the corresponding periods of 1996, 
primarily because of the acquisition of CEPA in January 1997. 

     Taxes other than  income  taxes.  Taxes  other than income  taxes for the
second quarter and year-to-date of 1997 when compared to the  corresponding  
periods of 1996  decreased  primarily  due to reductions of $18 million for the
quarter and $34 million year-to-date attributable to SWEB. These decreases 
resulted from the lowering,  in November  1996,  of the taxes on  electricity  
sales in the United Kingdom from 10% to 3.7%.

     Interest  income.  The  increase  in  interest  income for the  quarter and
year-to-date  as  compared to the same  periods of 1996,  is due to a $9 million
increase  for the quarter and a $19 million  increase  year-to-date  in interest
income for the non-traditional business, primarily CEPA.

     Interest on long-term debt. Interest on long-term debt for the quarter and
year-to-date 1997 compared to the same periods of 1996, increased primarily due
to non-traditional business activities, primarily CEPA. Southern Energy's
interest on long-term debt increased $45.1 million for the quarter and $65.2
million year-to-date 1997 compared to the corresponding periods in 1996, mainly
as a result of the CEPA acquisition. 

Interest on notes payable. Interest on notes payable for the quarter and 
year-to-date 1997 compared to the same periods of 1996, decreased primarily
due to a reduction in the amount of notes payable outstanding for the 
non-traditional business.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Minority interest. The increase in minority interest for the quarter and
year-to-date 1997 compared to the same periods in the previous year was due
primarily to the 20% minority interest in CEPA and to the sale in July 1996 of a
25% share of SWEB.

     Distributions on capital and preferred securities of subsidiaries. This
increase for the quarter and year-to-date 1997 resulted from the sales of
securities in 1996 and the first half of 1997. See Note (I) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information.

     Preferred dividends of subsidiary companies. The decrease in this item for
the quarter and year-to-date compared to the same periods in the previous year
is due to redemptions of preferred stock, including redemptions during the first
and second quarters of 1997. See "Financing Activities" herein for additional
information. 

Future Earnings Potential

     The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment, with non-traditional business becoming more significant.

     In May 1997, SOUTHERN announced that, through Southern Energy, it had
agreed to purchase 25% of the outstanding common stock of Berliner Kraft und
Licht AG (Bewag), the vertically integrated electric utility that serves Berlin,
Germany, for approximately $830 million. The purchase is subject to approval by
European regulators.

     On July 2, 1997, the new Labor government in the United Kingdom introduced
its first budget which included a windfall profit tax on privatized utilities.
Based on the proposed method of calculating this tax, SWEB estimates its
liability to be approximately $160 million. The tax is proposed to be payable in
two equal installments on or before December 1, 1997, and December 1, 1998. The
budget became effective on July 31, 1997.

     In July 1997, Southern Energy entered into an agreement to acquire Hopewell
Holdings Limited's (Hopewell) 19.99% share of CEPA. Under this agreement,
Southern Energy will buy from Hopewell its CEPA shares in exchange for $150
million and CEPA's 80% interest in the Tanjung Jati B Project. The Tanjung Jati
B Project is a 1,320 megawatt coal-fired power station in Central Java,
Indonesia. As a result of the transaction, Southern Energy will own over 99.9%
of CEPA's shares.

     In August 1997, a subsidiary of SOUTHERN entered into an agreement with
Vastar Resources Inc. (Vastar) providing for the organization of a limited
partnership to which the parties are to contribute their gas and power trading
and marketing businesses. SOUTHERN and Vastar will initially acquire indirect
ownership interests of 60% and 40%, respectively, of the new entity. In
addition, the SOUTHERN subsidiary will pay $40 million to Vastar in connection
with the partnership's formation, which is expected to occur in early September
1997.

     For additional information relating to non-traditional business activities,
including information relating to the acquisition in January 1997 of Southern
Energy's 80% interest in CEPA, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "New Business
Development" in the Form 10-K.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     In February, 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share.
The standard simplifies the computation of earnings per share (EPS) required by
existing rules. SOUTHERN will adopt this standard on December 31, 1997. If EPS
amounts were computed as specified by Statement No. 128, basic EPS and diluted
EPS would be equal, and would equal the amounts currently reported in the
"Condensed Statements of Income."

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of "comprehensive
income," which is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in
stockholders' equity, and its components. SOUTHERN will adopt the standard in
1998.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information. Statement No. 131, which supersedes
Statement Nos. 14, 18, 24 and 30, establishes new standards for segment
reporting, using the "management approach," in which reportable segments are
based on the same criteria on which management disaggregates a business for
making operating decisions and assessing performance. SOUTHERN is in the process
of evaluating Statement No. 131 and its impact and will adopt the standard by
1998.

(P) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion
of various contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings
potential. Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings"

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first six months of
1997 included the addition of approximately $790 million to utility plant and
the acquisition of CEPA. The funds for these additions and other capital
requirements were from operations and sales of securities. See SOUTHERN's
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first six months of 1997, retirements of the operating companies'
first mortgage bonds totaled $80 million and redemptions of preferred stock
totaled $270 million. Subsidiaries of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF and
MISSISSIPPI have formed statutory business trusts which sold, during the first
half of 1997, an aggregate of $1.3 billion of trust preferred or capital
securities. See Note (I) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements"
herein for further details.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     During the first six months of 1997, SOUTHERN raised $168 million from the
issuance of new common stock under SOUTHERN's various stock plans. The market
price of SOUTHERN's common stock at June 30, 1997 was $21.875 per share and the
book value was $13.64 per share, representing a market-to-book ratio of 160%,
compared to $22.625, $13.61 and 166%, respectively, at the end of 1996. The
dividend for the second quarter of 1997 was $0.325 per share.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of SOUTHERN
under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and
"Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern
electric system's capital requirements for its construction program,
environmental compliance efforts, sinking fund requirements and maturing debt.
Approximately $735 million will be required by June 30, 1998, for present
sinking fund requirements, redemption of preferred stock and redemptions and
maturities of long-term debt. Also, the operating companies plan to continue, to
the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock
and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 1997, as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
Currently, each of the operating companies expects to have adequate earnings
coverage ratios for any anticipated security sales through at least 1999. See
Item 1 BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
June 30, 1997, approximately $383 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $3,965 million of unused credit arrangements with banks (including
$962 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made only to
fund purchase obligations of the operating companies relating to variable rate
pollution control bonds). At June 30, 1997, the system companies had outstanding
approximately $319 million of short-term notes payable and $1.4 billion of
commercial paper. Since SOUTHERN's construction program with respect to major
generating projects in the traditional core business has been completed,
management believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by
utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

         See Note (D) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements"
herein for discussion of financial derivative contracts entered into by
SOUTHERN.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
and year-to-date 1997 was $63.1 million and $120.9 million, respectively,
compared to $95.8 million and $168.9 million for the corresponding periods of
1996. Earnings decreased 34.1% for the quarter and 28.4% year-to-date due
primarily to extremely mild weather and a decrease in prices charged to
commercial and industrial customers.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses and do not affect net income, revenues for the second quarter and
year-to-date 1997 decreased $40.4 million and $56.6 million, respectively,
compared to the corresponding periods of 1996. The decrease in revenues was due
to a reduction in the sale of energy to retail customers and a reduction in the
rates charged to industrial and commercial customers. Retail energy sales were
down by 4.1% for the quarter and 2.7% year-to-date primarily due to a 15.5%
decrease for the quarter and a 12.5% decrease year-to-date in energy sales to
residential customers. This decrease in energy sales to residential customers is
primarily a result of much milder-than-normal temperatures.

     Revenues from affiliates. Revenues from sales to affiliated companies
within the Southern electric system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary
from period to period depending on demand, the availability, and cost of
generating resources at each company. These transactions did not have a
significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. This decrease for the quarter and
year-to-date 1997 resulted from reduced demand for energy due to mild
temperatures.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Other operation expense. The decrease in other operation expense for both
the current quarter and year-to-date 1997 is primarily due to lower
administrative and general expenses compared to the same periods of 1996.

     Maintenance expense. Maintenance expense increased for the second quarter
and year-to-date 1997 compared to the same periods of 1996 primarily due to an
increase in the accrual of estimated maintenance expenses related to nuclear
refueling outages.

     Income taxes applicable to other income. The primary reason for this change
is attributable to ALABAMA's donation in June 1996 of certain nonutility
property which resulted in a reduction of income taxes applicable to other
income of approximately $10.6 million.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. The change in
this item resulted primarily from the issuance of additional mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities. For additional information, see Item 7
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital Structure" of ALABAMA in the
Form 10-K.

     Dividends on preferred stock. The decrease for the quarter and year-to-date
1997, compared to the corresponding periods of 1996, is due to redemptions
during the first half of 1997.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in
the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of "comprehensive
income," which is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in
stockholders' equity, and its components. ALABAMA will adopt the standard in
1998.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about 
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.  Statement No. 131, which 
supersedes Statement Nos. 14, 18, 24 and 30, establishes new standards for
segment reporting, using the "management approach," in which reportable 
segments are based on the same criteria on which management disaggregates a 
business for making operating decisions and assessing performance.  ALABAMA is 
in the process of evaluating Statement No. 131 and its impact and will adopt
the standard by 1998.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (G), (H), (J) and (K) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first six months of
1997 included the addition of approximately $193.6 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Financing Activities

During the first half of 1997, redemptions of first mortgage bonds and preferred
stock of ALABAMA totaled $131.8 million. Also, Alabama Power Capital Trust II, a
statutory business trust established for the purpose of holding ALABAMA's junior
subordinated notes and issuing trust preferred securities and common securities,
sold $200.0 million of its 7.60% trust originated preferred securities which are
guaranteed by ALABAMA. Additionally, ALABAMA redeemed $50 million of 7.60%
preferred stock (Second 1992 Series) in July 1997. For additional information,
see Note (I) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital Structure" of ALABAMA in the
Form 10-K.

     ALABAMA will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and
replace these securities with lower-cost capital, if market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of ALABAMA
under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital requirements
for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental compliance
efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
ALABAMA expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any anticipated
security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at June 30,
1997, approximately $6.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and had unused
committed lines of credit of approximately $814 million (including $208 million
of such lines under which borrowings may be made only to fund purchase
obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds) with regulatory
authority for up to $750 million of short-term borrowings. At June 30, 1997,
ALABAMA had outstanding $94.0 million of short-term notes payable to banks and
$418.9 million of commercial paper. Since ALABAMA has no major traditional
generating plants under construction, management believes that the need for
working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of June 30, 1997, and the related condensed statements of income and
cash flows for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 1997 and
1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1996
(not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 12, 1997, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1996 is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                     YEAR-TO-DATE 1997 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 1996


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
and year-to-date 1997 was $130.5 million and $236.5 million, respectively,
compared to $154.3 million and $268.7 million for the corresponding periods in
1996. Earnings decreased by 15.4% for the quarter and 12.0% year-to-date
primarily as a result of decreased revenues due to milder-than-normal weather
experienced during both periods.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses and do not affect income, revenues for the second quarter of 1997
decreased $77 million and for year-to-date 1997 decreased $108 million, compared
to the corresponding periods of 1996. Retail revenues, excluding fuel revenues,
decreased 9.1%, or $72 million for the current quarter and 7.0%, or $105 million
year-to-date as compared to the corresponding periods of 1996. The decrease in
retail revenues is primarily due to a decrease in residential and commercial
kilowatt-hours sold. Retail energy sales to residential and commercial customers
decreased 16.1% and 2.4%, respectively, for the second quarter 1997 and 12.9%
and 2.0%, respectively, for year-to-date 1997 when compared to the corresponding
periods in 1996, as a result of milder-than-normal temperatures. Additionally,
although industrial sales remained relatively constant for the second quarter of
1997 and increased 1.6% year-to-date 1997 when compared to the corresponding
periods in 1996, industrial revenues decreased primarily as a result of more
customers taking advantage of load management rates.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The decrease in purchased power from
non-affiliates for the second quarter and year-to-date 1997 compared to the
corresponding periods of 1996 resulted from a decrease in energy purchases due
to milder-than-normal temperatures.

     Other operation expense. The decrease in other operation expense for the
current quarter and year-to-date is primarily due to an adjustment in 1996 to a
deferred regulatory asset as a result of changes in GEORGIA's retiree benefits
plan and lower administrative and general expenses compared to corresponding
periods of 1996.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in depreciation and
amortization for the current quarter and year-to-date compared to the same
period of 1996 is primarily due to additional depreciation charges of $8 million
and $28 million, respectively, pursuant to a Georgia PSC retail accounting order
discussed below. See "Future Earnings Potential" below and Note (L) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further details.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary companies. The increase
in this item resulted primarily from the issuance of additional mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities in August 1996, January 1997 and June 1997. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Financing Activities" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K, and Note (I) in the "Notes
to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein.

     Dividends on preferred stock. The decline in dividends on preferred stock
in each period reflects the redemption of various issues of such securities.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in
the Form 10-K.

     Effective January 1, 1996, GEORGIA began operating under a three-year
retail accounting order. Under the order, GEORGIA's earnings are evaluated
against a retail return on common equity range of 10% to 12.5%. GEORGIA is
required to absorb cost increases of approximately $29.0 million annually during
the order's three-year operation, including $14.0 million annually of
accelerated depreciation of electric plant. Reference is made to Note (L) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information.

     The staff of the Georgia PSC has issued a report regarding its prudence
review of the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric plant. Reference is
made to Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for
additional information.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of "comprehensive
income," which is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in
stockholders' equity, and its components. GEORGIA will adopt the standard in
1998.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about 
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.  Statement No. 131, which 
supersedes Statement Nos. 14, 18, 24 and 30, establishes new standards for
segment reporting, using the "management approach," in which reportable 
segments are based on the same criteria on which management disaggregates a 
business for making operating decisions and assessing performance.  GEORGIA is 
in the process of evaluating Statement No. 131 and its impact and will adopt 
the standard by 1998.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (G) and (L) through (P) in the "Notes
to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first six months of
1997 was the addition of approximately $229 million to utility plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations. See GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

During the first half of 1997, maturities and redemptions of first mortgage
bonds and preferred stock by GEORGIA totaled $193 million. In January 1997,
Georgia Power Capital Trust II, a statutory business trust established for the
purpose of holding GEORGIA's junior subordinated notes and issuing trust
preferred securities and common securities, sold $175.0 million of its 7.60%
trust preferred securities, which are guaranteed by GEORGIA. (See Note (I) in
the " Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Financing Activities" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K for
further details.)

     In April 1997, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, $90.0 million of
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds due 2032. The proceeds were
applied to the redemption on July 1, 1997 of $90.0 million outstanding principal
amount of 8.375% pollution control revenue bonds.

     In June 1997, Georgia Power Capital Trust III , a statutory business trust
established for the purpose of holding GEORGIA's junior subordinated notes and
issuing trust preferred securities and common securities, sold $189.3 million of
its 7.75% quarterly income preferred securities, which are guaranteed by
GEORGIA. (See Note (I) in the " Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" for
further details.)

     GEORGIA plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Issues" in the
Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital requirements for its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
GEORGIA expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any anticipated
security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at June 30,
1997, approximately $19.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$946.1 million of unused credit arrangements with banks (including $681.1
million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made only to fund
purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds). At June
30, 1997, GEORGIA had outstanding $1.3 million of short-term notes payable to
banks and $100.6 million of commercial paper. Since GEORGIA has no major
generating plants under construction, management believes that the need for
working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of June 30, 1997, and the related condensed
statements of income and cash flows for the three-month and six-month periods
ended June 30, 1997 and 1996. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1996
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 12, 1997, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1996, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter and
year-to-date 1997 was $10.4 million and $21.1 million, respectively, compared to
$12.6 million and $23.8 million for the corresponding periods of 1996. The
earnings decrease of 17.4% and 11.4% for the quarter and year-to-date,
respectively, was primarily due to milder-than-normal temperatures.

     Revenues. Excluding fuel and other revenues which represent the
pass-through of fuel expense and certain other expenses and do not affect net
income, revenues for the second quarter and year-to-date 1997 decreased $3.4
million or 3.8% and $9.8 million or 5.6%, respectively, compared to the
corresponding periods of 1996. Retail revenues decreased 5.2% for the quarter
and 5.5% year-to-date due primarily to a decrease in the amount of energy sold
to residential customers. Sales to residential customers for the quarter and
year-to-date decreased 8.9% and 10.4%, respectively, due to the
milder-than-normal temperatures. Energy sales to industrial customers increased
8.1% and 3.3% for the quarter and year-to-date 1997, respectively, however
revenues from this sector had only a slight increase of 0.7% for the quarter and
a 1.6% decrease year-to-date 1997 primarily due to the participation of these
customers in the Real-Time-Pricing program. See Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K for
information on initiatives to remain competitive and to meet conservation goals
set by the Florida PSC.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Purchased
power from affiliates year-to-date compared to the corresponding period of 1996
was lower due to maintenance outages at Plant Crist and Plant Daniel during the
first half of 1996. Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the
Southern electric system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from period
to period depending on demand and the availability

and cost of generating resources at each company.  These transactions do not 
have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. The decrease in fuel expense for the second quarter and
year-to-date 1997 was primarily due to decreased generation as a result of the
milder-than-normal temperatures and a lower cost of fuel.

     Other operation expense. The increase in other operation expense was
primarily due to an increase in amortization costs related to the buyout and
renegotiation of a coal supply contract.

     Maintenance expense. The decrease in maintenance expense for the second
quarter and year-to-date is primarily due to the scheduled maintenance on
production facilities which occurred in the first half of 1996 at Plant Crist
and Plant Daniel.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trust. See "Financing
Activities" herein for details relating to the January 1997 issuance by Gulf
Power Capital Trust I of its 7.625% trust preferred securities.

     Dividends on preferred stock. This decrease for the second quarter and
year-to-date 1997 when compared to the corresponding periods of 1996 is due to
preferred stock redemptions in the first quarter of 1997.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a potentially less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the
Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of "comprehensive
income," which is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in
stockholders' equity, and its components. GULF will adopt the standard in 1998.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about 
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.  Statement No. 131, which
supersedes Statement Nos. 14, 18, 24 and 30, establishes new standards for
segment reporting, using the "management approach," in which reportable 
segments are based on the same criteria on which management disaggregates a
business for making operating decisions and assessing performance.  GULF is in
the process of evaluating Statement No. 131 and its impact and will adopt the 
standard by 1998.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (G) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first six months of 1997
included the addition of approximately $21.5 million to utility plant. The funds
for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first quarter of 1997, Gulf Power Capital Trust I, a statutory
business trust established for the purpose of holding GULF's junior subordinated
notes and issuing trust preferred securities and common securities, sold $40
million of its 7.625% trust preferred securities which are guaranteed by GULF.
For additional information, see Note (I) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Sources of Capital" of GULF in the Form 10-K. A portion of these proceeds was
used to redeem $5 million of 7.88% cumulative preferred stock, $5 million of
7.52% cumulative preferred stock and $14.5 million of 7.00% cumulative preferred
stock during the first quarter of 1997 and $15 million of 7.30% cumulative
preferred stock in August 1997.

     On July 1, 1997, GULF sold, through public authorities, $40.93 million of
variable rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds due July 1, 2022. The
proceeds were used to redeem $32 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25%
pollution control revenue refunding bonds; $5 million aggregate principal amount
of 6.75% pollution control revenue refunding bonds; and $3.93 million aggregate
principal amount of 6.75% pollution control revenue refunding bonds.

     Also, on August 1, 1997, GULF sold $20 million of Series B 7.50% Junior
Subordinated Notes due June 30, 2037. The proceeds were used to pay a portion of
the scheduled maturity of $25 million of 5.875% first mortgage bonds that were
due on August 1, 1997.

     GULF plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.


Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and "Other
Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of GULF's capital
requirements for its construction program, environmental compliance efforts and
maturing debt.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
GULF expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any anticipated
security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at June 30, 1997,
approximately $0.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $95.9 million of
unused committed lines of credit with banks (including $61.9 million liquidity
support for variable rate pollution control bonds). At June 30, 1997, GULF had
outstanding $19.5 million of short-term notes payable to banks. Since GULF has
no major generating plants under construction, management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second
quarter and year-to-date 1997 was $12.6 million and $23.3 million, respectively,
compared to $11.4 million and $23.1 million for the corresponding periods of
1996. Earnings for the current quarter increased by 10.7% primarily as a result
of lower operating expenses. For the year-to-date period, earnings were
relatively flat as evidenced by the slight 0.7% increase.

     Revenues. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a 7.8% decrease for
the quarter and a 4.8% decrease for year-to-date in the amount of energy sold.
Total retail energy sales decreased 2.9% and 2.1% for the quarter and
year-to-date, respectively, primarily due to a 13.4% and 10.3% decrease in the
amount of energy sold to residential customers. Retail revenues, excluding those
revenues which represent the recovery of fuel expense and certain other expenses
and do not affect income, decreased $0.8 million for the quarter and $4.4
million for year-to-date 1997 primarily due to milder temperatures experienced
during these periods as compared to 1996. Second quarter and year-to-date
revenues from territorial wholesale customers, excluding fuel revenues which do
not affect income, decreased $0.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively,
compared to the same periods of 1996, with a decrease in energy sales of 4.5%
and 4.0%, respectively.

     Fuel expense. The second quarter and year-to-date 1997 decreases can be
attributed to the lower cost of fuel and to decreases in generation of 12.0% for
the quarter and 4.4% year-to-date 1997. Generation decreased due to the reduced
demand for energy resulting from milder temperatures.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. In addition, the
second quarter and year-to-date 1997 periods reflect adjustments in affiliated
billings. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operation expense. This decrease for the quarter and year-to-date
1997 as compared to the corresponding periods of 1996 is primarily due to lower
administrative and general expenses.

     Maintenance expense. Maintenance expenses will vary from period to period
depending on the timing and scheduling of maintenance outages and other
projects.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment. Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in rates under
the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force on electric
rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking place. MISSISSIPPI's 1997
annual filing under the ECO Plan with the Mississippi PSC resulted in an
approved annual revenue requirement increase of $0.9 million, effective April
1997.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. For additional information about the Clean Air Act
and other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of "comprehensive
income," which is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in
stockholders' equity, and its components. MISSISSIPPI will adopt the standard in
1998.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about 
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.  Statement No. 131, which 
supersedes Statement Nos. 14, 18, 24 and 30, establishes new standards for
segment reporting, using the "management approach," in which reportable 
segments are based on the same criteria on which management disaggregates a 
business for making operating decisions and assessing performance.  MISSISSIPPI
is in the process of evaluating Statement No. 131 and its impact and will adopt
the standard by 1998.

     Employees of MISSISSIPPI, in certain areas, including finance,
environmental quality and external affairs, are being offered a Career
Transition Plan. This voluntary plan is an effort to find appropriate ways to
reduce employees, while at the same time providing employees with choices about
their future. The costs to be incurred in connection with this plan are unknown
at the present time.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (G) and (H) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential. Reference is also made to
Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first six months
of 1997 included the addition of approximately $26.7 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
for further details.

Financing Activities

During the first quarter of 1997, Mississippi Power Capital Trust I, a statutory
business trust established for the purpose of holding MISSISSIPPI's junior
subordinated notes and issuing trust preferred securities and common securities,
sold $35 million of its 7.75% trust originated preferred securities which are
guaranteed by MISSISSIPPI. For additional information, see Note (I) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Sources of Capital" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.


Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of
MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its construction program, environmental
compliance efforts, sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
MISSISSIPPI expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any
anticipated security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS -
"Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at June
30, 1997, approximately $12.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $76.3 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks
(including $10.8 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made
only to fund purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control
bonds). At June 30, 1997, MISSISSIPPI had no short-term borrowings outstanding.
Since MISSISSIPPI has no major generating plants under construction, management
believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing
lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                     YEAR-TO-DATE 1997 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 1996


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second quarter
and year-to-date 1997 was $5.1 million and $7.7 million, as compared to $5.9
million and $8.6 million for the corresponding periods of 1996. Earnings
decreased 12.3% for the quarter and 10.7% for year-to-date due to a decrease in
operating revenues caused primarily by milder-than-normal temperatures.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>

         Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of
fuel expenses and do not affect income, revenues for the quarter and
year-to-date decreased $2.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively, compared to
the corresponding periods of 1996. Revenues decreased as a result of decreased
energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers of 14.7%, 4.3%,
9.4%, respectively, for the quarter and 11.6%, 1.8% and 1.8%, respectively, for
year-to-date. The decreases were primarily due to milder-than-normal
temperatures during the quarter and year-to-date for the residential and
commercial sectors. The decreases in the industrial class were due to a decrease
in the energy requirements of one of SAVANNAH's major industrial customers.

     Fuel expenses. The decreases for the quarter and year-to-date can be
attributed to a decrease in the average cost of fuel and the overall lower
demand for energy.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. In addition, the
second quarter and year-to-date 1997 reflect an adjustment in affiliated
billings. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Taxes other than income taxes. The decreases for the quarter and
year-to-date 1997 were due to a true-up of property tax accrual to actual tax
expense in 1996 and lower franchise taxes.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH
in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of "comprehensive
income," which is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in
stockholders' equity, and its components. SAVANNAH will adopt the standard in
1998.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about 
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.  Statement No. 131, which
supersedes Statement Nos. 14, 18, 24 and 30, establishes new standards for
segment reporting, using the "management approach," in which reportable 
segments are based on the same criteria on which management disaggregates a
business for making operating decisions and assessing performance.  SAVANNAH is
in the process of evaluating Statement No. 131 and its impact and will adopt 
the standard by 1998.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (Q) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first six months of
1997 included the addition of approximately $10.4 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See SAVANNAH's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

In April 1997, SAVANNAH sold, through a public authority, $13.87 million of
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds due 2037. The proceeds were
applied to the redemption in May 1997 of $13.87 million of 6 3/4% pollution
control revenue bonds.

     SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. Currently,
SAVANNAH expects to have adequate earnings coverage ratios for any anticipated
security sales through at least 1999. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at June 30,
1997, approximately $3.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$32.5 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. At June 30, 1997,
SAVANNAH had $8.0 million of short-term notes payable to banks. Since SAVANNAH
has no major generating plants under construction, management believes that the
need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)   The condensed financial  statements of the registrants included herein
      have been prepared by each registrant,  without audit, pursuant to the
      rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of each  registrant's
      management, the information regarding such registrant furnished herein
      reflects  all  adjustments   (which  included  only  normal  recurring
      adjustments)  necessary to present  fairly the results for the periods
      ended  June 30,  1997  and  1996.  Certain  information  and  footnote
      disclosures  normally  included in  financial  statements  prepared in
      accordance  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles have been
      condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations,  although
      each  registrant   believes  that  the   disclosures   regarding  such
      registrant  are  adequate  to  make  the  information   presented  not
      misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements
      be read in  conjunction  with the financial  statements  and the notes
      thereto  included in each  registrant's  latest  annual report on Form
      10-K. Certain  prior-period  amounts have been reclassified to conform
      with current-period presentation.

          The condensed financial statements of ALABAMA and GEORGIA included
      herein have been reviewed by ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's independent public
      accountants as set forth in their reports included herein as Exhibit 1 to
      ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)   SOUTHERN's operating affiliates are subject to the provisions of FASB
      Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
      Regulation. In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no
      longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
      off related regulatory assets and liabilities, and determine if any other
      assets have been impaired. For additional information, see Note 1 to the
      financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(C)   The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
      practices of the electric utility industry--including
      SOUTHERN's--regarding the recognition, measurement and classification of
      decommissioning costs for nuclear generating facilities in the financial
      statements. In response to these questions, the FASB has decided to review
      the accounting for liabilities related to closure and removal of
      long-lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
      SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial
      statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA under "Depreciation and
      Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)   SOUTHERN engages in price risk management activities for trading and
      non-trading purposes. Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial
      statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a discussion of
      these activities. Activities for non-trading purposes consist of
      transactions that are employed to mitigate SOUTHERN's risk related to
      interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. At June 30, 1997, the
      status of outstanding non-trading related derivative contracts was as
      follows:

       Net unrealized gains and losses on outstanding positions with respect to
       trading activities were not material at June 30, 1997.

(E)   On January 29, 1997, Southern Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
      SOUTHERN, completed the acquisition of an 80% interest in CEPA for a total
      net investment of approximately $2.0 billion. (Reference is made to the
      Current Report on Form 8-K of SOUTHERN dated October 9, 1996 for a more
      detailed description of the acquisition. In addition, reference is also
      made to "Management's Discussion and Analysis - Future Earnings Potential"
      of SOUTHERN herein for information relating to the proposed acquisition by
      Southern Energy of an additional 19.99% interest in CEPA.)

         The acquisition of CEPA was accounted for as a purchase with the $1.5
      billion excess of the acquisition cost over the preliminary estimate of
      the fair value of CEPA's net assets being assigned to goodwill. The
      allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and may be revised at a
      later date. Goodwill will be amortized on a straight-line basis over 40
      years. Results of operations of CEPA are included in the condensed
      consolidated financial statements subsequent to January 29, 1997.

         The following unaudited pro forma combined results of operations for
      the three months ended June 30, 1997 and 1996 and the six months ended
      June 30, 1997 and 1996 have been prepared assuming the acquisition of CEPA
      had occurred at the beginning of each period. The pro forma results assume
      acquisition financing of $764 million of short-term borrowings, $792
      million of long-term notes and $400 million of capital securities and
      SOUTHERN's assumed effective composite interest rate on these obligations
      for each period presented was 6.70%. Eventually, the existing borrowing
      may be replaced by some other combination of long-term debt and equity.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(J)   In June 1995, the Alabama PSC issued a rate order granting ALABAMA's
      request for gradual adjustments to move toward parity among customer
      classes. This order also calls for a moratorium on any periodic retail
      rate increases (but not decreases) until July 2001. In December 1995, the
      Alabama PSC issued an order authorizing ALABAMA to reduce balance sheet
      items--such as plant and deferred charges--at any time ALABAMA's actual
      base rate revenues exceed the budgeted revenues. Reference is made to Note
      3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the
      Form 10-K for additional information. In April 1997, the Alabama PSC
      issued an additional order authorizing ALABAMA to reduce balance sheet
      asset items. This order authorizes the reduction of such items up to an
      amount equal to 5 times the total estimated annual revenue reduction
      resulting from future rate reductions.

(K)   In 1996, legal actions against ALABAMA were filed in several counties in
      Alabama charging ALABAMA with fraud and non-compliance with regulatory
      statutes relating to the offer, sale and financing of "extended service
      contracts" in connection with the sale of electric appliances. See Note 3
      to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for additional information.

(L)   In February 1996, the Georgia PSC approved a three-year accounting order,
      effective January 1, 1996, which is currently under appeal.  GEORGIA is 
      continuing to recognize expenses in accordance with the accounting order 
      while it is under appeal.  Under the order, earnings in excess of a 12.5%
      retail return on common equity will be used to accelerate the 
      amortization of regulatory assets or depreciation of electric plant.  
      Accordingly, for earnings in excess of the 12.5% return, GEORGIA recorded
      charges of $8 million and $28 million, respectively, for the three
      months and six months ended June 30, 1997 (presented in the accompanying 
      financial statements as depreciation expense and as an addition to the 
      reserve for depreciation).  For additional information, reference is made
      to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and GEORGIA in Item 8 
      of the Form 10-K.

(M)   In 1987 and 1989, the Georgia PSC ordered that the allowed costs of Plant
      Vogtle, a two-unit nuclear facility of which GEORGIA owns 45.7%, be phased
      into rates. Pursuant to the orders, GEORGIA recorded a deferred return
      under phase-in plans until October 1991 when the allowed investment was
      fully reflected in rates. In 1991, the Georgia PSC levelized the remaining
      Plant Vogtle declining capacity buyback expenses over a six-year period.
      In addition, GEORGIA deferred certain Plant Vogtle operating expenses and
      financing costs under accounting orders issued by the Georgia PSC. These
      Georgia PSC orders provide for the recovery of deferred costs within 10
      years. The unamortized balance of these deferred costs at June 30, 1997,
      was $95.8 million.

(N)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and 
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information concerning the 
      recovery by GEORGIA of its costs associated with the Rocky Mountain 
      pumped storage hydroelectric plant.  At June 30, 1997, GEORGIA's net 
      investment in the plant was approximately $167 million.  In
      August 1997, the staff of the Georgia PSC issued a report regarding its 
      prudence review of the plant.  The report recommends that of GEORGIA's 
      initial $202 million investment in the plant, approximately $79 million
      be allowed in rate base, with a disallowance of approximately 
      $123 million.  The report also concludes that GEORGIA should be
      allowed to retain the benefits of the plant's lower fuel costs (as 
      compared to alternative sources of generation).  The report states that
      as an alternative, it may be reasonable to provide a larger allowance in 
      rate base and allow customers to receive the benefit of the fuel savings. 
      GEORGIA estimates the present value of the fuel benefits over the life of
      the plant to be in the range of approximately $50 million to $70 million.
      The Georgia PSC intends to conclude hearings on this matter in December 
      1997, at which time the Georgia PSC will take the matter under advisement
      for future action.  While GEORGIA disagrees with the Georgia PSC staff's 
      conclusions, the outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

                        On July 24, 1997, ALABAMA, GEORGIA, MISSISSIPPI and
                        other plaintiffs entered into an agreement with TVA that
                        will settle the action filed in April 1997, which sought
                        to enjoin TVA from violating a 1959 act that prohibits
                        TVA from selling power outside the area that was being
                        served by it in 1957. In the settlement agreement, TVA
                        agrees that it will enter into exchange power
                        arrangements only with authorized entities to which it
                        may lawfully sell such power under the 1959 act, and
                        that it will not knowingly engage in such transactions
                        where the authorized entity is reselling that power to
                        unauthorized entities.
