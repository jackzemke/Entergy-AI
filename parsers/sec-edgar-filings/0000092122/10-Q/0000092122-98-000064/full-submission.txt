                 THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   FIRST QUARTER 1998 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1997

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SOUTHERN's consolidated net income for the first quarter 1998 was $242 million
($0.35 per share) compared to $187 million ($0.28 per share) for the
corresponding period of 1997. Earnings from non-traditional operations
positively impacted net income during the first quarter.

     SOUTHERN's traditional core business is primarily represented by its five
domestic electric utility operating companies, which provide electric service in
four Southeastern states. Another significant portion of SOUTHERN's business is
its non-traditional business primarily represented by Southern Energy, which
owns and manages international and domestic businesses for SOUTHERN. Businesses
acquired by Southern Energy have been included in the consolidated statements of
income since the date of acquisition. Certain changes in operating revenues and
expenses from the prior period are the result of such acquisitions. 

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the 
following:

</TABLE>

     Operating revenues. Operating revenues for the traditional core business
for the first quarter increased $47 million or 2.5% compared to the
corresponding period of 1997. Operating revenues for non-traditional business
were down $117 million or 17.3% for the quarter due primarily to a change in the
method of reporting for Southern Energy's energy marketing organization. (See
Note (D) in the "Notes to Condensed Financial Statements" herein.) The increase
in first quarter traditional core revenues was mainly due to a 4.4% increase in
energy sales during the quarter. Energy sales to the residential, commercial and
industrial sectors increased by 8.1%, 2.3% and 3.3%, respectively.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Purchased power expense. For the first quarter, purchased power expenses
for the traditional core business rose by $41.4 million or 130.1%. The increase
for the quarter was primarily due to increased energy sales to residential,
commercial and industrial customers. For non-traditional business, purchased
power expenses declined by $192 million, or 44.9%, as compared to the
corresponding period of 1997. As stated above, the primary reason for this
decline is due to a change in the method of reporting for the power purchasing
activities of Southern Energy's energy marketing organization.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization
expense of the traditional core business for the quarter increased compared to
the corresponding period in 1997. This increase can be attributed primarily to
additions to utility plant and to additional depreciation charges of $12.2
million for the quarter pursuant to GEORGIA's retail accounting order as
discussed in Note (M) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements"
herein.

     Amortization of deferred Plant Vogtle costs. The costs decreased for the
quarter due to the completion in September 1997 of the amortization of levelized
buybacks and Plant Vogtle Unit 1 cost deferrals under the 1987 Georgia PSC
order. See Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements", herein
for further details.

     Interest income. The increase in interest income for the quarter as
compared to the corresponding period of 1997, is due to a $7.5 million increase
in interest income for the non-traditional business, primarily CEPA.

     Income taxes applicable to other income. The increase for the quarter when
compared to the same period in 1997 is primarily due to certain acquisitions by
Southern Energy, specifically BEWAG and an energy-related alternative fuel
company.

     Interest on long-term debt. Interest on long-term debt for the quarter
compared to the same period of 1997, increased primarily due to the CEPA and
BEWAG acquisitions. Southern Energy's interest on long-term debt increased $23.0
million for the quarter compared to the corresponding period in 1997, mainly as
a result of those acquisitions. 

     Distributions on capital and preferred securities of subsidiaries. This 
increase for the quarter resulted from the sales of capital and preferred 
securities in 1997 and the first quarter of 1998.

     Preferred dividends of subsidiary companies. The decrease in this item for
the quarter when compared to the corresponding period in 1997 is due to
redemptions of preferred stock. See "Financing Activities" herein for additional
information.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future  earnings  potential.  The level of future  earnings  depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated,  more  competitive
environment,  with  non-traditional  business  becoming  more  significant.  For
information  relating  to  non-traditional  business  activities,  see  Item 1 -
BUSINESS - "Non-Traditional Business" in the Form 10-K.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     In March 1998, The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued a new Statement of Position (SOP), Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The SOP, which must be adopted
by 1999, requires capitalization of costs of internal-use software. Adoption of
the SOP is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.

through (P) and (R) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for discussion of various contingencies and other matters which may affect
future earnings potential. Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal
Proceedings" herein.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first three months of
1998 included the addition of approximately $438 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were from operations
and sales of securities. See SOUTHERN's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Financing Activities

During the first three months of 1998, retirements of the operating companies'
first mortgage bonds totaled $235 million. A subsidiary of GULF formed a
statutory business trust which sold, during the first three months of 1998, $45
million of trust preferred securities. See Note (J) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further details. Also during the
first quarter of 1998, ALABAMA issued $200.0 million of 7% senior notes and
GEORGIA issued $145.0 million of 6 7/8% senior notes, both due December 31,
2047.

     During the first three months of 1998, SOUTHERN raised $89 million from the
issuance of new common stock under SOUTHERN's various stock plans. The market
price of SOUTHERN's common stock at March 31, 1998 was $27.6875 per share and
the book value was $13.98 per share, representing a market-to-book ratio of
198%, compared to $25.875, $13.91 and 186%, respectively, at the end of 1997.
The dividend for the first quarter of 1998 was $0.335 per share.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of SOUTHERN
under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and
"Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern
electric system's capital requirements for its construction program,
environmental compliance efforts, sinking fund requirements and maturing debt.
Approximately $935 million will be required by March 31, 1999, for present
sinking fund requirements, redemption of preferred stock and redemptions and
maturities of long-term debt. Also, the operating companies plan to continue, to
the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock
and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 1998, as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
operating companies plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
March 31, 1998, approximately $477 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $4.5 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks (including
$1,160 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made only to
fund purchase obligations of the operating companies relating to variable rate
pollution control bonds). At March 31, 1998, the system companies had
outstanding approximately $652 million of short-term notes payable and $1,160
million of commercial paper. Management believes that the need for working
capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining
large cash balances.

     See Note (D) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein
for discussion of financial derivative contracts entered into by SOUTHERN.

                    FIRST QUARTER 1998 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1997


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter
1998 was $66.0 million compared to $57.8 million for the corresponding period of
1997. Earnings for this quarter increased 14.2% when compared to the same period
in 1997 due to increased revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

            Dividends on preferred stock......................       (2,370)            (41.6)
</TABLE>

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses and do not affect net income, revenues for the first quarter increased
$11.2 million compared to the corresponding period of 1997. The increase in
first quarter revenues when compared to the same period of 1997 was due to a
4.5% increase in retail energy sales, primarily to residential customers. Energy
sales to residential customers increased 7.5% due to relatively normal
temperatures during the first quarter of 1998 as compared to temperatures that
were much milder than normal during the first quarter of 1997.

     Revenues from affiliates. Revenues from sales to affiliated companies
within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on
demand, the availability, and cost of generating resources at each company.
These transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increase for the quarter compared
to the corresponding period of 1997 resulted primarily from increased purchases
related to power marketing activities, a majority of which were resold to
non-affiliated third parties. These transactions had no significant effect on
net income.

     Maintenance expense. The decrease during this quarter when compared to the
same period in 1997 is attributable to lower nuclear maintenance expenses.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     Dividends on preferred stock. The decrease for the current quarter compared
to the same period of 1997 resulted from redemptions of preferred stock during
1997.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of ALABAMA in
the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of ALABAMA in the Form 10-K.

     In March 1998, The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued a new Statement of Position (SOP), Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The SOP, which must be adopted
by 1999, requires capitalization of costs of internal-use software. Adoption of
the SOP is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (F), (G), (H), (K) and (L) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
Reference is also made to Part II - Item 1 - "Legal Proceedings" herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first three months of
1998 included the addition of approximately $132.8 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Financing Activities

During the first three months of 1998, redemptions and maturities of first
mortgage bonds of ALABAMA totaled $74.3 million. In February 1998, ALABAMA
issued $200.0 million of 7% senior notes due December 31, 2047. The proceeds
were used to repay a portion of ALABAMA's short-term indebtedness. In April
1998, ALABAMA issued $190.0 million of 7% senior notes due March 31, 2048. The
proceeds will be used to redeem $124.2 million of ALABAMA's First Mortgage
Bonds, 8 3/4% Series due December 1, 2021 and to repay a portion of outstanding
short-term indebtedness.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     ALABAMA will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and
replace these securities with lower-cost capital as market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
ALABAMA under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital
requirements for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental
compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at March 31,
1998, approximately $18.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and had unused
committed lines of credit of approximately $813.6 million (including $208.2
million of such lines under which borrowings may be made only to fund purchase
obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds) with regulatory
authority for up to $750 million of short-term borrowings. At March 31, 1998,
ALABAMA had no outstanding short-term notes payable to banks and $259.0 million
of commercial paper.

                                                                    Exhibit 1





                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of March 31, 1998, and the related condensed statements of income and
cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 1998 and 1997. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1997
(not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 11, 1998, we expressed

                    FIRST QUARTER 1998 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1997


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter
1998 was $105.9 million, essentially unchanged from $106.0 million for the same
period in 1997.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>

     Revenues. Excluding fuel and demand-side program revenues, which represent
the pass-through of fuel and demand-side program expenses and generally do not
affect income, revenues for the first quarter of 1998 increased $16.7 million
compared to the corresponding period of 1997. Retail revenues, excluding fuel
and demand-side program revenues, increased 3.5%, or $23.1 million for the
current quarter as compared to the corresponding period of 1997 primarily due to
a 5.0% increase in retail energy sales. Energy sales increased by 10.2%, 5.2%
and 1.8% to residential, commercial and industrial customers, respectively, due
primarily to milder-than-normal weather in the first quarter of 1997. Wholesale
revenues, excluding fuel revenues, decreased $7.7 million compared to the
corresponding period of 1997 primarily due to a decrease in capacity revenues
under a power supply agreement with OPC.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increase for the current quarter
is primarily due to an increase in energy purchases related to power marketing
activities, a majority of which were resold to non-affiliated third parties.
These transactions had no significant effect on net income.

     Other operation expense. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to
higher expenses associated with a new customer service system implemented in
January 1998, and modification of certain information systems for year 2000
compliance. For additional information on the year 2000 issue, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in
the Form 10-K.

     Maintenance expense. The increase in the current quarter from the
corresponding period of 1997 is primarily due to higher costs associated with
steam plant and transmission and distribution line maintenance.

     Depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in depreciation and
amortization for the current quarter compared to the same period of 1997 is
primarily due to an increase in additional depreciation charges of $12.2
million, pursuant to a Georgia PSC retail accounting order discussed below, and
an increase in plant-in-service. See "Future Earnings Potential" below and Note
(M) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for further
details regarding the retail accounting order.

     Amortization of deferred Plant Vogtle costs. The costs decreased for the
quarter due to the completion in September 1997 of the amortization of levelized
buybacks and Plant Vogtle Unit 1 cost deferrals under the 1987 Georgia PSC
order. See Note (N) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements", herein
for further details.

     Interest on long-term debt and Dividends on preferred stock. The decreases
in these items for the current quarter result from the refinancing of long-term
debt and redemption of various issues of such securities.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary companies. The increase
in this item resulted primarily from the issuance of additional mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities in June 1997. For additional information, see
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Financing Activities" of
GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in
the Form 10-K.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Effective January 1, 1996, GEORGIA began operating under a three-year
retail accounting order. Under the order, GEORGIA's earnings are evaluated
against a retail return on common equity range of 10% to 12.5%. GEORGIA is
required to absorb cost increases of approximately $29.0 million annually during
the order's three-year operation, including $14.0 million annually of
accelerated depreciation of electric plant. Reference is made to Note (M) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information.

     On January 14, 1998, the Georgia PSC ordered that GEORGIA be allowed
approximately $108 million of its $143 million investment in the Rocky Mountain
pumped storage hydroelectric plant in rate base as of December 31, 1998.
Reference is made to Note (O) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the Form 10-K.

     In March 1998, The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued a new Statement of Position (SOP), Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The SOP, which must be adopted
by 1999, requires capitalization of costs of internal-use software. Adoption of
the SOP is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (C), (F), (H) and (M) through (P) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first three months
of 1998 was the addition of approximately $80.3 million to gross plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See GEORGIA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

During the first three months of 1998, redemptions of first mortgage bonds by
GEORGIA totaled $120.5 million. In January 1998, GEORGIA issued $145.0 million
of 6 7/8% senior notes due December 31, 2047. The proceeds from this issuance
were used to repay a portion of GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     In March 1998, GEORGIA sold, through public authorities, $89.99 million
aggregate principal amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds with
$72.99 million aggregate principal amount due in 2024 and $17.0 million
aggregate principal amount due in 2025. The proceeds were used in April 1998 to
redeem $4.1 million aggregate principal amount of 6.20% pollution control
revenue bonds; $22.1 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% pollution
control revenue bonds; $17.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90%
pollution control revenue bonds; and $46.79 million aggregate principal amount
of 5 3/8% pollution control revenue bonds.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     GEORGIA has announced the planned redemption of $40.7 million of preferred
stock in June 1998.

     GEORGIA plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Issues" in the
Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital requirements for its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at March 31,
1998, approximately $18.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$1.1 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks (including $879 million of
such arrangements under which borrowings may be made only to fund purchase
obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds). At March 31,
1998, GEORGIA had $286.3 million outstanding in short-term notes payable to
banks or commercial paper. Since GEORGIA has no major generating plants under
construction, management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

     We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of March 31, 1998, and the related condensed
statements of income and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31,
1998 and 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1997
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 11, 1998, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1997, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                    FIRST QUARTER 1998 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1997


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter 1998
was $6.9 million compared to $10.7 million for the corresponding period of 1997.
Earnings for the quarter decreased due primarily to an increase in operating
expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

     Revenues. Excluding a decrease in fuel and other revenues of $6.1 million,
which represent the pass-through of fuel expense and certain other expenses and
do not affect net income, revenues increased $0.5 million or 0.6% for the first
quarter compared to the corresponding period of 1997. Retail revenues decreased
3.0% for the first quarter compared to the same period of 1997 despite a 2.5%
increase in retail energy sales. Energy sales to residential and commercial
customers were up 6.1% and 1.6%, respectively, while energy sales to industrial
customers were down 3.9%. Revenues associated with residential customers were up
2.2% for this first quarter and down for such period 3.8% and 20.0% for
commercial and industrial customers, respectively. The decrease in revenues from
the commercial and industrial sectors is primarily due to the increased
participation of these customers in the Real-Time Pricing Program. See Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GULF in
the Form 10-K for information on initiatives to remain competitive and to meet
conservation goals set by the Florida PSC.

     Revenues from affiliates and Purchased power from affiliates. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system, as well as
purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. The increase in fuel expense compared to the corresponding
period in 1997 can be attributed to increased generation as a result of higher
energy sales during the first quarter.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increase in purchased power from
non-affiliates compared to the corresponding period in 1997 can primarily be
attributed to an increase in energy purchases related to increased power
marketing activities, a majority of which were resold to non-affiliated third
parties. These transactions had no significant effect on net income.

     Maintenance expense. The increase in maintenance expense compared to the
corresponding period in 1997 is primarily due to scheduled maintenance performed
on production facilities at Plant Crist and Plant Smith during the first quarter
of 1998.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary companies. See
"Financing Activities" herein for details relating to the January 1998 issuance
by Gulf Power Capital Trust II of its 7.00% trust preferred securities.

     Dividends on preferred stock. Current quarter preferred stock dividends
decreased when compared to the same period in 1997 due to the redemptions of
preferred stock during 1997.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the
Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     In March 1998, The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued a new Statement of Position (SOP), Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The SOP, which must be adopted
by 1999, requires capitalization of costs of internal-use software. Adoption of
the SOP is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (F) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first three months of
1998 included the addition of approximately $11.1 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See GULF's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

During the first quarter of 1998, Gulf Power Capital Trust II, a statutory
business trust established for the purpose of holding GULF's junior subordinated
notes and issuing trust preferred securities and common securities, sold $45
million of its 7.00% trust preferred securities which are guaranteed by GULF.
For additional information, see Note (J) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Sources of Capital" of GULF in the Form 10-K. The proceeds were used to redeem
$36.4 million of cumulative preferred stock and to repay short-term
indebtedness.

     GULF plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.


Capital Requirements

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF
under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental Matters" and
"Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of GULF's
capital requirements for its construction program, environmental compliance
efforts and maturing debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at March 31,
1998, approximately $2.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $36.0 million
of unused committed lines of credit with banks in addition to $61.9 million
liquidity support for variable rate pollution control bonds. At March 31, 1998,
GULF had $26.5 million of short-term notes payable to banks. Since GULF has no
major generating plants under construction, management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 1998 vs. FIRST QUARTER 1997


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first
quarter 1998 was $8.4 million compared to $10.6 million for the corresponding
period of 1997. Earnings for the current quarter decreased by 21.2% primarily as
a result of increased operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>

     Revenues. The increase in revenues was due primarily to an increase of $2.8
million in non-territorial wholesale energy sales. Retail revenues, excluding
those revenues which represent the recovery of fuel expense and certain other
expenses and do not affect income, decreased $0.4 million for the quarter due to
decreased energy sales during this period as compared to 1997. First quarter
revenues from territorial wholesale customers, excluding fuel revenues which do
not affect income, increased $0.7 million compared to the same period of 1997,
with an increase in energy sales of 3.0%.

     Revenues from affiliates. Revenues from sales to affiliated companies
within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
The change in the first quarter 1998 when compared to the same period in 1997
reflect adjustments to affiliated billings in first quarter of 1997. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. The decrease in fuel expense was due to decreased generation
when compared to the same period in 1997.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increase in purchased power from
non-affiliates can be attributed to off-system energy purchases primarily resold
to non-affiliated third parties. These transactions had no significant effect on
net income.

     Other operation expense. The current quarter increase in other operation
expense was primarily due to higher administrative and general expenses.

     Maintenance expense. The increase for the current quarter compared to the
same period in 1997 is due to a scheduled outage at Plant Watson Unit 5 and
higher distribution line expenses.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment. Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in rates under
the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force on electric
rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking place.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. MISSISSIPPI's 1998 ECO Plan filing was approved, as
filed, by the Mississippi PSC on March 17, 1998 and resulted in a small decrease
in customer prices. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other
environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     In March 1998, The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued a new Statement of Position (SOP), Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The SOP, which must be adopted
by 1999, requires capitalization of costs of internal-use software. Adoption of
the SOP is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (B), (F) and (G) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first three months
of 1998 included the addition of approximately $12.9 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See MISSISSIPPI's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
for further details.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



Financing Activities

In May 1998, MISSISSIPPI sold through public authorities, $13.52 million of
variable rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds due May 1, 2028. The
proceeds will be used to redeem $13.0 million of the 6.20% Series pollution
control revenue bonds and to pay certain costs of issuance. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Sources of
Capital" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" in the Form 10-K for a description of
MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its construction program, environmental
compliance efforts, sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at March
31, 1997, approximately $1.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $76.3 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks
(including $10.9 million of such arrangements under which borrowings may be made
only to fund purchase obligations relating to variable rate pollution control
bonds). At March 31, 1998, MISSISSIPPI had $69.0 million of notes payable
outstanding. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter
1998 was $2.4 million as compared to $2.5 million for the corresponding period
of 1997.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

            Maintenance expense...............................          636               20.9

</TABLE>

     Revenues. Excluding fuel revenues, which represent the pass-through of fuel
expenses and do not affect income, revenues increased $1.4 million for the
quarter when compared to the same period of 1997. Revenues for the quarter were
up $5.3 million due to a 6.1% increase in retail energy sales. Energy sales to
residential, commercial and industrial customers increased by 4.6%, 3.7% and
11.3%, respectively, due to an increase in customers and high usage by a large
industrial customer.

     Fuel expenses. The increase for the quarter is due to increased generation
as a result of higher demand for energy.

     Purchased power from non-affiliates. The increase in purchased power from
non-affiliates can primarily be attributed to an increase in energy purchases
related to increased power marketing activities, a majority of which were resold
to non-affiliated third parties. These transactions had no significant effect on
net income.

     Purchased power from affiliates. Purchases of energy within the Southern
electric system will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. In addition, the
first quarter of 1997 reflected an adjustment in affiliated billings. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Maintenance expense. The increase for the current quarter when compared to
the same period in 1997 is due to expenses associated with the Plant Kraft Unit
3 scheduled turbine outage.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more competitive
environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, the Southern electric system
is positioning the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For
additional information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH
in the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     In March 1998, The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued a new Statement of Position (SOP), Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The SOP, which must be adopted
by 1999, requires capitalization of costs of internal-use software. Adoption of
the SOP is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (B) and (Q) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first three months of
1998 included the addition of approximately $4.3 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See SAVANNAH's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

In March 1998, SAVANNAH issued $30.0 million of Series A 6 5/8% senior retail
intermediate bonds due March 17, 2015. The proceeds of the sales were used by
SAVANNAH to redeem in April 1998 the $28.9 million outstanding principal amount
of its 8.30% Series First Mortgage Bonds due July 1, 2022.

     SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at March 31,
1998, approximately $29.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$37.5 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. At March 31, 1998,
SAVANNAH had $3.0 million outstanding of notes payable to banks. Since SAVANNAH
has no major generating plants under construction, management believes that the
need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)  The condensed financial  statements of the registrants included herein have
     been prepared by each registrant,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and
     regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of each registrant's management, the
     information   regarding  such  registrant  furnished  herein  reflects  all
     adjustments (which included only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to
     present  fairly the results for the periods  ended March 31, 1998 and 1997.
     Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
     statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
     principles  have been  condensed  or  omitted  pursuant  to such  rules and
     regulations,   although  each  registrant  believes  that  the  disclosures
     regarding such  registrant are adequate to make the  information  presented
     not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed financial  statements
     be read in conjunction with the financial  statements and the notes thereto
     included in each  registrant's  latest annual report on Form 10-K.  Certain
     prior period amounts have been  reclassified to conform with current period
     presentation.

         The condensed financial statements of ALABAMA and GEORGIA included
      herein have been reviewed by ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's independent public
      accountants as set forth in their reports included herein as Exhibit 1 to
      ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's condensed financial statements.

(B)   SOUTHERN's operating affiliates are subject to the provisions of FASB
      Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
      Regulation. In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no
      longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
      off related unrecoverable regulatory assets and liabilities, and determine
      if any other assets have been impaired. For additional information, see
      Note 1 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the
      Form 10-K.

(C)   The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
      practices of the electric utility industry--including
      SOUTHERN's--regarding the recognition, measurement and classification of
      decommissioning costs for nuclear generating facilities in the financial
      statements. In response to these questions, the FASB has decided to review
      the accounting for liabilities related to closure and removal of
      long-lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
      SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial
      statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA under "Depreciation and
      Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)   SOUTHERN engages in price risk management activities. Reference is made to
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS "Derivative Financial Instruments"
      and Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for a discussion of these activities. Activities for non-trading
      purposes consist of transactions that are employed to mitigate SOUTHERN's
      risk related to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. At March
      31, 1998, the status of outstanding non-trading related derivative
      contracts was as follows:

      Effective in January 1998, Southern Energy and Vastar Resources, Inc.
      combined their energy trading and marketing activites to form a joint
      venture. Southern Energy's investment in the joint venture is accounted
      for under the equity method of accounting. SOUTHERN has made guarantees to
      certain counterparties regarding performance of contractual commitments by
      the joint venture. At March 31, 1998, total guarantees were approximately
      $125 million.

(E)  Effective  December 31, 1997,  SOUTHERN  adopted  FASB  Statement  No. 131,
     Disclosure  about  Segments  of  an  Enterprise  and  Related  Information.
     SOUTHERN's  principal  business segment -- or its traditional core business
     -- is the five regulated electric utility operating  companies that provide
     electric service in four southeastern states. The other reportable business
     segment is  non-traditional  energy services  provided by Southern  Energy,
     which develops and manages  electricity and other  energy-related  projects
     both in the United  States and abroad.  In 1997,  non-traditional  domestic
     services  included  revenues  related to energy trading and  marketing.  As
     discussed  in Note (D) above,  effective  January  1998,  that  business is
     accounted  for under the equity  method and its revenues are not  reflected
     below for 1998. Intersegment revenues are not material.  Financial data for
     business segments for the periods covered in the Form 10-Q are as follows:

      (Note) The all other category includes parent SOUTHERN, which does not
      allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category
      includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate
      disclosure. These segments include a wireless communication company and a
      developmental company for energy products and services. Non-traditional
      services exclude interest expense to parent SOUTHERN.

(F)   Reference is made to Notes 3 and 7 to each of the registrant's financial
      statements, except SAVANNAH's, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a discussion
      of the proceedings initiated by the FERC regarding the reasonableness of
      the return on common equity on certain of the Southern electric system's
      wholesale rate schedules and contracts and a
      discussion of the long-term sales agreements. On April 3, 1998, three
      customers under the long-term power sales agreements filed a complaint
      with the FERC seeking (a) to lower the equity return component in such
      agreements from the existing return rate of 13.75% and (b) to unbundle the
      transmission component of such agreements and instead take transmission
      services under SOUTHERN's open access transmission tariff presently
      pending before the FERC. The common equity return under these agreements
      is also subject to the ultimate outcome of the pending FERC proceeding
      commenced in May 1991 and discussed in Note 3. The
      final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

(G)   Certain of the registrants and other SOUTHERN subsidiaries have instituted
      work force reduction programs. The expenses recognized under these
      programs and the unamortized balance of expenses deferred under regulatory
      orders were as follows: (in thousands)

(H)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN,
      ALABAMA and GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to
      a settlement agreement entered into between SOUTHERN and the Internal
      Revenue Service on certain tax issues for the years 1984 through 1987.

(I)   CEPA has been included in the consolidated financial statements since
      January 29, 1997. The following unaudited pro forma results of operations
      for the three months ended March 31, 1997 have been prepared assuming the
      acquisition of CEPA was effective January 1, 1997. The pro forma results
      assume acquisition financing of $716 million of short-term borrowings,
      $792 million of long-term notes and $600 million of capital securities.
      SOUTHERN's assumed effective composite interest rate on these obligations
      for each period was 6.82%.

         These unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the
      actual results that would have been realized had the acquisition occurred
      on the indicated date, nor are they necessarily indicative of future
      results. Pro forma operating results are for information purposes only and
      are as follows:

      Substantially all the assets of the trust are junior subordinated notes
      issued by GULF in the approximate principal amount set forth above. GULF
      considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the preferred
      securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute a full and
      unconditional guarantee by it of the trust's payment obligations with
      respect to the preferred securities.


(K)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to retail rate
      adjustment procedures.

(L)   In 1996, legal actions against ALABAMA were filed in several counties in
      Alabama charging ALABAMA with fraud and non-compliance with regulatory
      statutes relating to the offer, sale and financing of "extended service
      contracts" in connection with the sale of electric appliances. See Note 3
      to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and ALABAMA in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for additional information.

(M)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information concerning a three-year
      accounting order approved by the Georgia PSC effective January 1, 1996.
      Under the order, earnings in excess of a 12.5% retail return on common
      equity are to be used to accelerate the amortization of regulatory assets
      or depreciation of electric plant. Accordingly, for earnings in excess of
      the 12.5% return, GEORGIA recorded charges of $32.0 million and $19.8
      million for the three months ended March 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively
      (presented in the accompanying financial statements as depreciation
      expense of electric plant and as an addition to the reserve for
      depreciation).

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)



(N)   Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to Plant
      Vogtle phase-in plans resulting from orders of the Georgia PSC. These
      Georgia PSC orders provide for the recovery of deferred costs within 10
      years. The unamortized balance of these deferred costs at March 31, 1998,
      was $42.6 million.

(O)  Reference  is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information  concerning the recovery
     by GEORGIA of its costs  associated  with the Rocky Mountain pumped storage
     hydroelectric  plant.  On January 14,  1998,  the Georgia PSC ordered  that
     GEORGIA  be  allowed   approximately  $108  million  of  its  $143  million
     investment  in the plant in rate base as of December 31, 1998.  GEORGIA has
     appealed the Georgia  PSC's order to the Superior  Court of Fulton  County,
     Georgia.  If such order is ultimately  upheld,  GEORGIA will be required to
     record a charge  to  earnings  currently  estimated  at  approximately  $27
     million,  after  taxes.  The final  outcome  of this  matter  cannot now be
     determined.   Accordingly,  no  provision  related  to  the  Georgia  PSC's
     disallowance has been recorded.

(P)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
      designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
      Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
      environmental contingencies.

(Q)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SAVANNAH in
      Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to certain regulatory
      matters.

(R)  Mobile Energy (a wholly-owned  SOUTHERN  subsidiary) received notice in May
     1998 from a major  customer of the  customer's  intention to close its pulp
     mill in Mobile,  Alabama,  for which Mobile  Energy  provides  electricity,
     steam  and  other  services.  The  closure  of the mill  will be  effective
     September 1, 1999. The mill provided  approximately  50% of Mobile Energy's
     operating  revenues  for the quarter  ended March 31, 1998 and for the year
     ended December 31, 1997.  Mobile Energy is evaluating the announced closure
     of the mill to  determine  its  options  and the  potential  impact  on its
     business. In the event that a sufficient  alternative revenue source is not
     obtained,  the mill closure will have a material  adverse  effect on Mobile
     Energy's revenues, and, thereafter,  it will not have sufficient cash flows
     to pay principal and interest on its senior debt, including $238 million of
     first mortgage bonds and $85 million related to tax-exempt bonds. There can
     be no assurance that any available alternative will permit Mobile Energy to
     pay its debt service.  At March 31, 1998, Mobile Energy had total assets of
     $388  million  and  equity of $16  million.  The  ultimate  outcome of this
     situation cannot now be determined.
