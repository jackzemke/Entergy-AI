                 THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
              MANAGEMENT'S OPINION AS TO FAIR STATEMENT OF RESULTS

    The condensed financial statements of SOUTHERN included herein have been
prepared by SOUTHERN, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the SEC.  In the opinion of SOUTHERN's management, subject to the effect of
such adjustments, if any, as might have been required had the outcome of the
uncertainty with respect to the actions of the regulators regarding the
recoverability of GEORGIA's investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped storage
hydroelectric project, as more fully discussed in Note (G) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein, been known, the information furnished herein
reflects all adjustments (which, except for the provision for separation
benefits recorded in 1994, included only normal recurring adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the results for the periods ended September 30,
1994 and 1993.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations, although SOUTHERN believes that the disclosures are adequate to
make the information presented not misleading.  It is suggested that these
condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and the notes thereto included in SOUTHERN's latest annual report on
Form 10-K and, with  respect to nuclear decommissioning, the March 31, 1994
quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

                 THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS
SOUTHERN's earnings for the third quarter of 1994 fell below the earnings
recorded in the same period of 1993 primarily because of lower revenues.
Consolidated net income was $416 million for the third quarter of 1994,
compared to $442 million for the third quarter of 1993.  Earnings per share
were $0.64 and $0.70 in the third quarter of 1994 and 1993, respectively.

REVENUES
Revenues decreased due to lower fuel clause revenues, reduced sales to
off-system utilities and weather influences.  The summer of 1993 was
exceptionally hot in contrast to the milder than normal temperatures
experienced this past summer.  As discussed further in Note (N) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein, ALABAMA recorded an additional $28
million in unbilled revenues as a result of adopting a new procedure for
estimating such sales.  Excluding ALABAMA's recognition of additional unbilled
energy sales, retail energy sales for the third quarter of 1994 decreased 4.4%,
compared to the third quarter of 1993, however, because of continued economic
development in the Southeast, sales to industrial customers increased 2.3%.
Wholesale energy sales decreased 22.9% due to reduced demand and contractually
scheduled reductions in off-system contracts.  As a result, total energy sales
decreased 7.5%, excluding ALABAMA's additional unbilled energy sales.  Capacity
revenues for the third quarter of 1994 were $17 million less than in the third
quarter of 1993.  The capacity revenues decreased as scheduled, a significant
portion of which coincides with GEORGIA completing the third sale of a portion
of Plant Scherer Unit 4 in June 1994.  The final sale in a series of four
transactions for the sale of this generating unit is scheduled for June 1995.
The generation from this unit has been dedicated to unit power sales.

EXPENSES
Fuel expense for the third quarter of 1994, compared to the corresponding
period of 1993, was significantly lower due primarily to a decrease in the
average cost of coal and less generation which reflects lower demand.
Purchased power expense decreased because of the reduction in capacity buyback
payments by GEORGIA to the co-owners of plants Vogtle and Scherer and lower
demand from wholesale customers.  See Note (F) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for information regarding the Georgia PSC's retail rate order
that required the levelization of capacity buyback expense for Plant Vogtle.

   Other operation expenses dropped sharply in the third quarter of 1994,
compared to the corresponding period of 1993.  However, the expenses for 1993
included such costs as $20 million for an automotive fleet reduction program,
$12 million for environmental remediation, $4 million for SAVANNAH's work force
reduction program, the recognition of higher employee benefit costs and higher
reserves for uncollectible accounts.  Other operation expenses in the third
quarter of 1994 reflect lower pension costs as indicated by updated actuarial
estimates.  The increase in maintenance expenses is attributable to ALABAMA
accruing $28 million for the establishment of a Natural

Disaster Reserve.  This new reserve is offset by ALABAMA's recognition of
additional unbilled energy and revenues, as discussed above.

    The Southern electric system has instituted a number of initiatives to curb
the growth of expenses, including workforce reduction programs.  The one-time
cost of these programs (approximately $96 million expensed and $15 million
deferred) is expected to be recovered within three years through operation and
maintenance and capital cost savings.  See Note (M) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for further information on these programs.

    The decrease in income tax expense was due to lower earnings and because
the SOUTHERN system recorded additional income tax expense in the third quarter
of 1993 due to the enactment of the retroactive federal income tax rate
increase in August 1993.

INTEREST CHARGES AND DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED STOCK
The decrease in interest on long-term debt and dividends on preferred stock
reflects the SOUTHERN system's efforts to decrease its capital costs.  In
response to the low interest rate levels prevailing during 1992 and 1993, the
SOUTHERN system refinanced a significant portion of its long-term debt and
preferred stock.  To the extent it is economically feasible, efforts to reduce
capital costs will continue.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction and not included in rate base.  The equity portion represents
non-cash income.  However, when facilities are completed and included in rate
base, previously capitalized amounts significantly increase cash flow because
revenues are higher as a result of the increased rate base and additional
depreciation expense.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings is contingent upon
numerous factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.

    Reference is made to the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for further discussion of various uncertainties and legal proceedings related
to: the actions of regulators regarding the recovery of GEORGIA's investment
in the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project; a civil suit filed
against ALABAMA related to financing agreements; the outcome of proceedings
initiated by the FERC to determine the appropriate return on equity on
wholesale power and transmission contracts; and complaints filed by MEAG and
OPC seeking to recover from GEORGIA an aggregate of $22.8 million (including
interest) in alleged partial requirements rates overcharges.

                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

    Pursuant to an Integrated Resource Plan approved by the Georgia PSC,
GEORGIA has implemented various demand-side option programs and had been
authorized by the Georgia PSC to recover associated program costs through rate
riders.  A superior court judge's ruling that recovery of these costs through
rate riders was unlawful was reversed by the Georgia Court of Appeals in July
1994.  GEORGIA has ceased collection of the rate riders and the Georgia PSC has
allowed the deferral of program costs pending the final outcome of this matter.
For additional information on this matter, see Note (H) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein.

    During the third quarter of 1994, OPC gave GEORGIA notice, as contractually
required, of its intent to decrease its purchases of capacity under a power
supply agreement.  As a result, GEORGIA's capacity revenues from OPC will
decline approximately $7.5 million in 1996 and an additional $15.5 million in
1997.

    The IRS has notified SOUTHERN that its tax accounting for the sale by
GEORGIA of a portion of Plant Vogtle in 1984 was improper.  The potential tax
deficiency and interest arising from this issue amount to approximately $30
million and $33 million, respectively.  The tax deficiency relates to a timing
issue as to when taxes are paid, therefore only the interest could impact
future income.  In September 1994, GEORGIA deposited $46 million with the IRS
to prevent additional interest charges should GEORGIA's position on this issue
not prevail.  See Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
further discussion of this matter.

    Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
increased costs cannot be offset.  The Clean Air Act is discussed under
"Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
SOUTHERN's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Also see Note (K) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for information regarding a list of sites,
including a number of sites owned by GEORGIA, compiled by the State of Georgia
that may require environmental remediation.

    Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, and the rate of economic growth in SOUTHERN's service area.  The
enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the electric utility
industry.  A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy Act and
particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SOUTHERN's 1993
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition,
measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating
stations in financial statements.  In response to these questions, the

                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

Accounting Standards Board has decided to review the accounting for nuclear
decommissioning.  If current electric utility industry accounting practices for
such decommissioning costs are changed: (1) annual provisions for
decommissioning could increase and (2) the total estimated cost for
decommissioning may be required to be recorded as a liability on the balance
sheet.  ALABAMA and GEORGIA do not believe that such changes, if required,
would have a significant adverse effect on results of operations due to their
current and expected future ability to recover decommissioning costs through
rates.  Further discussion of nuclear decommissioning costs is made in Note (C)
to the Condensed Financial Statements herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first nine
months of 1994 were the addition of approximately $1.0 billion to utility
plant, the commercial operation of seven combustion turbine generating units
having an aggregate nameplate capacity of approximately 555 megawatts, the sale
of a portion of Plant Scherer Unit 4, recognition of the liability associated
with the implementation of workforce reduction programs and the sale of
SOUTHERN's common stock for $206 million.  The funds for gross property
additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from
operations, the sale of a portion of Plant Scherer and other security sales.
See SOUTHERN's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.
Additionally, SOUTHERN's board of directors declared a two-for-one common stock
split in the form of a stock distribution for each share issued and outstanding
as of February 7, 1994.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE
One of SOUTHERN's goals is to maintain common equity as a percent of total
capitalization, including short-term debt and the current portion of
capitalization, within a range of 40 to 45%.  This ratio was 45.8% at September
30, 1994, compared to 43.8% at December 31, 1993.  The market price of
SOUTHERN's common stock at September 30, 1994, was $18.625 per share, compared
to a book value of $12.45.  This represents a market-to-book value ratio of
150%.  The quarterly dividend for the third quarter of 1994 was 29.5 cents per
share.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION
The construction program of the Southern electric system is budgeted at $4.3
billion for the three years 1994 through 1996 ($1.5 billion in 1994, $1.3
billion in 1995 and $1.5 billion in 1996). Actual construction costs may vary
from this estimate because of such factors as changes in business conditions;
changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulations; changes in environmental
regulations; revised load growth projections; increasing costs of labor,
equipment and materials; and the cost of capital.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  (Continued)

    Current energy demand forecasts do not require any additional baseload
generating facilities until well into the future.  However, the construction of
combustion turbine peaking units of approximately 1,700 megawatts is planned by
1996, including those that began commercial operation in 1994, to meet the
increased peak-hour demands.  In addition, significant construction will
continue related to transmission and distribution facilities and the upgrading
and extension of the useful lives of generating plants.  GEORGIA and OPC have
entered into a joint ownership agreement for the latter to assume
responsibility for the construction and completion of the Rocky Mountain
project.  This agreement is described further in Note 4 to the financial
statements in Item 8 of SOUTHERN's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the
Southern electric system's capital requirements and operating costs.  The acid
rain compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will have a significant impact
on the Southern electric system.  This legislation, as well as other
legislation and regulations, are described under "Environmental Matters" in
Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SOUTHERN's 1993 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.  The full impact of these requirements cannot be determined at
this time, pending the development and implementation of applicable
regulations.

OTHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
In addition to the funds needed for the construction program, approximately
$408 million, excluding those funds on deposit with trustees and which are
specifically designated for called redemptions, will be required by September
30, 1995, for present sinking fund requirements, redemptions and maturities of
long-term debt and preferred stock.  Also, the operating subsidiaries plan to
continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire high-cost debt and
preferred stock and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital.

SOURCES OF FUNDS
In addition to the sale of common stock in the first nine months of 1994,
SOUTHERN may require additional equity capital during the remainder of the
year.  The amounts and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in
1994, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's
investment opportunities.  The operating subsidiaries plan to obtain the funds
required for construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used
in the past.  However, the type and timing of financings will depend on market
conditions, maintenance of adequate earnings, and regulatory approval.
Additionally, GEORGIA expects to receive approximately $130 million in 1995
from the sale of its remaining ownership interest in Plant Scherer Unit 4.
These property sales are discussed further in Note 7 to the financial
statements in Item 8 in SOUTHERN's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

                 THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
                     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION  (Continued)

    To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
September 30, 1994 approximately $117 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $1.3 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks.

    At September 30, 1994, the system companies had outstanding $335 million of
notes payable and $239 million of commercial paper.  The short-term lines of
credit may not be utilized in their entirety without additional regulatory
approval.  Since the construction program with respect to major generating
projects has been completed, management believes that the need for working
capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining
large cash balances.

    In order to issue additional long-term debt and preferred stock, the
operating subsidiaries must comply with certain earnings coverage requirements
outlined in their respective mortgage indentures and corporate charters.  The
coverage ratios of SOUTHERN's operating subsidiaries are sufficiently high to
permit, at present interest rate levels, any foreseeable security sales.  The
amount of securities which they will be permitted to issue in the future will
depend upon market conditions and other factors prevailing at that time.

                             ALABAMA POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ALABAMA's financial performance during the third quarter of 1994 declined,
compared to the same period of 1993, due primarily to lower revenues.  Net
income after dividends on preferred stock was $141.2 million during the third
quarter of 1994, compared to $150.8 million in the corresponding period of
1993.

REVENUES
Operating revenues in the third quarter of 1994 decreased from the
corresponding period of 1993 due to lower fuel clause revenues, a decrease in
wholesale energy sales and mild weather during this more recent period.  Also,
capacity revenues from non-affiliated wholesale customers decreased $8.4
million.  As discussed further in Note (N) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein, ALABAMA in September 1994 recorded an additional $28 million
in estimated unbilled revenues due to a new procedure to compute such sales.

    Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company.  These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

EXPENSES
Fuel expense decreased because of a 12.3% decrease in coal-fired generation and
a lower average cost of fuel consumed.  Coal-fired generation decreased because
it was displaced with lower cost nuclear and hydro generation and because of
lower demand.  Other operation expenses for the third quarter of 1994 reflect a
reduction in ALABAMA's portion of the costs of the system service company's
work force reduction program and, in response to updated actuarial estimates,
lower accruals for pension costs.  Other operation expenses in the third
quarter of 1993 included the costs of an automotive fleet reduction program,
raising the reserve for uncollectible accounts and recording its portion of
environmental remediation costs for a SOUTHERN system research facility which
together totaled $11.5 million.  The increase in maintenance expense reflects
the establishment of a Natural Disaster Reserve as discussed further in Note
(N) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein.

    Taxes other than income taxes increased because of the addition of new
facilities.  The decrease in income tax expense reflected the change in
earnings and the recognition of additional income taxes in the third quarter of
1993 to reflect the retroactive federal income tax rate increase enacted in
August 1993.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

OTHER INCOME AND ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
The change in "Other, net" is primarily attributable to increases in
contributions to non-profit organizations.  AFUDC represents the estimated debt
and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the
construction of new facilities.  While cash is not realized currently from such
allowance, it is realized over the service life of the plant through increased
revenues resulting from a higher rate base and higher depreciation expense.

INTEREST CHARGES AND DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED STOCK
The decreases in interest on long-term debt and dividends on preferred stock
reflect ALABAMA's efforts to decrease its capital costs.  ALABAMA, in response
to the low interest rate levels prevailing during 1992 and 1993, refinanced a
significant portion of its long-term debt and preferred stock.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.

    Discussed in the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein are
certain regulatory and legal proceedings that may impact ALABAMA's future
earnings.  The issues include a civil suit related to financing agreements and
proceedings concerning the reasonableness of the Southern electric system's
wholesale rate schedules and contracts.  Also discussed therein is the
establishment of a Natural Disaster Reserve, a new procedure for estimating
unbilled sales and a retail rate increase moratorium.

    Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
cost increases cannot be offset.  The Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues are discussed under "Environmental Issues" in Item 7 - Management's
Discussion and Analysis in ALABAMA's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    Future earnings will also depend upon growth in electric sales which are
subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors have included
changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced
by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather, competition, and the rate of
economic growth in ALABAMA's service area.  The enactment of the Energy Act
will have a profound effect on the future of the electric utility industry.  A
discussion of the potential impact of the Energy Act and particularly its
effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 -
Management's Discussion and Analysis in ALABAMA's 1993 Annual Report on Form
10-K.

      The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition,
measurement and classification of decommissioning costs

for nuclear generating stations in financial statements.  In response to these
questions, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has decided to review the
accounting for nuclear decommissioning.  If current electric utility industry
accounting practices for such decommissioning costs are changed: (1) annual
provisions for decommissioning could increase and (2) the total estimated cost
for decommissioning may be required to be recorded as a liability on the
balance sheet.  ALABAMA does not believe that such changes, if required, would
have a significant adverse effect on results of operations due to its current
and expected future ability to recover decommissioning costs through rates.
Further discussion of nuclear decommissioning costs is made in Note (C) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The principal changes in ALABAMA's financial condition in the first nine months
of 1994 were gross property additions of $334 million to utility plant and the
establishment of the Natural Disaster Reserve.  The funds for gross property
additions were derived from operating activities and an increase in short-term
debt.  See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows herein for further
details.

    During the first nine months of 1994, ALABAMA refinanced $180 million of
pollution control bonds.  ALABAMA's common equity as a percent of total
capitalization was 49.0% at September 30, 1994, compared to 47.4% at year-end
1993.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
ALABAMA has committed lines of credit and regulatory approval for short-term
borrowings of up to $530 million.  At September 30, 1994, ALABAMA had
outstanding $97 million of commercial paper and $25 million of notes payable.

   Capital expenditures are estimated to total $1.7 billion for the three years
1994 through 1996 ($588 million in 1994, $572 million in 1995 and $531 million
in 1996).  Current energy demand forecasts do not require any additional
baseload generating facilities until well into the future.  However, the
construction of combustion turbine peaking units of approximately 720 megawatts
of capacity is planned by 1996 to meet increased peak-hour demands.  In
addition, significant construction of transmission and distribution facilities
and upgrading of generating plants will continue.

    The capital budget is subject to periodic review and revision and capital
costs incurred may vary from estimates because of several factors, including
changes in business conditions; revised load growth projections; changes in
environmental regulations; changes in existing nuclear plant to meet new
regulatory requirements; increasing costs of labor, equipment and materials;
and the cost of capital.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION  (Continued)

   In addition to the funds needed for the capital budget, approximately $197.5
million will be required by September 30, 1995, for debt maturities.  This
amount includes $101.65 million for pollution control bonds that have been
refinanced.  The funds for these redemptions are on deposit with the Trustee
and are specifically designated for only that purpose.

    It is anticipated that the funds required will be derived from sources
similar to those used in the past.  In order to issue additional first mortgage
bonds and preferred stock, ALABAMA must comply with certain earnings coverage
requirements contained in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter.
ALABAMA's coverages are at a level that would permit necessary amounts of
security sales at current interest and dividend rates.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS





TO ALABAMA POWER COMPANY:

    We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY as of September 30, 1994, and the related condensed statements of
income for the three-month, nine-month and twelve-month periods ended September
30, 1994 and 1993, and condensed statements of cash flows for the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 1994 and 1993.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.

    We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of
which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken
as a whole.  Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

    Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

   We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of ALABAMA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1993
(not presented herein) and, in our report dated February 16, 1994, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on that statement.  In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.

                             GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
              MANAGEMENT'S OPINION AS TO FAIR STATEMENT OF RESULTS


         The condensed financial statements of GEORGIA included herein have
been prepared by GEORGIA, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the SEC.  As more fully discussed in Note (G) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein, an uncertainty exists with respect to the actions of the
regulators regarding the recoverability of GEORGIA's investment in the Rocky
Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project.  In the opinion of GEORGIA's
management, subject to the effect of such adjustments, if any, as might have
been required had the outcome of the uncertainty been known, the information
regarding GEORGIA furnished herein reflects all adjustments (which, except for
the provision for separation benefits recorded in 1994, included only normal
recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results for the periods
ended September 30, 1994 and 1993.  Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to SEC rules and regulations, although GEORGIA believes that the
disclosures regarding GEORGIA are adequate to make the information presented
not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be
read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto
included in GEORGIA's latest annual report on Form 10-K and, with respect to
nuclear decommissioning, the March 31, 1994 quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

    The condensed financial statements of GEORGIA included herein have been
reviewed by GEORGIA's independent public accountants as set forth in their
report included herein as Exhibit 1.

                             GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS
GEORGIA's earnings for the third quarter of 1994 declined compared to the
corresponding quarter of 1993.  Net income after dividends on preferred stock
was $233.3 million in the third quarter of 1994 and $244.7 million in the third
quarter of 1993.  The decline is the result of lower retail revenues primarily
due to weather, partially offset by reductions in other operation expenses and
lower financing costs.

REVENUES
Total operating revenues decreased compared to the third quarter of 1993
because of the decrease in energy sales to retail and non-affiliated wholesale
customers.  Excluding fuel clause revenues, which represent the pass-through of
fuel expenses and do not affect income, operating revenues for the third
quarter of 1994 decreased $96.6 million, compared to the corresponding period
of 1993.

    Retail - Retail energy sales for the third quarter of 1994 decreased 6.0%.
The summer of 1993 was exceptionally hot, whereas the summer of 1994 was milder
than normal.  Residential and commercial energy sales decreased 17.2% and 3.0%,
respectively, while industrial sales increased 1.4%.  Total non-fuel retail
revenues decreased $92.2 million.

    Wholesale - Energy sales to non-affiliated wholesale customers for the
third quarter of 1994 decreased 37.7%, compared to the corresponding period of
1993.  Capacity revenues from non-affiliated utilities outside the service area
were down $6.4 million.  These capacity revenues decreased as scheduled,
coinciding with GEORGIA completing the third sale in a series of four
transactions for the sale of Plant Scherer Unit 4 in June 1994.  The final
transaction for the sale of this unit is scheduled for June 1995 and coincides
with scheduled reductions in capacity revenues of approximately $19 million in
1995 and an additional $11 million in 1996.  Energy revenues from
non-affiliated utilities outside the service area decreased $10.5 million.  The
energy component of contract sales is priced at approximately the variable
production cost and does not materially affect earnings.

    Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period
depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company.  These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

OPERATING EXPENSES
Fuel and Purchased Power - Fuel expense decreased primarily because of lower
generation, the displacement of coal-fired generation with lower cost hydro
generation and the lower cost of fuel.  Purchased power expense for the third
quarter of 1994 decreased primarily due to GEORGIA purchasing less energy
because of lower demand and scheduled reductions in capacity buyback payments
to the co-owners of plants Vogtle and Scherer.  See Note (F) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for information regarding the levelization of
capacity buyback expense for Plant Vogtle.

   Other - Other operation expenses were down compared to the third quarter of
1993 due primarily to the recognition in 1993 of a one-time cost of
approximately $15 million for an automotive fleet reduction program,
environmental remediation costs at various locations of approximately $7
million in the third quarter of 1993, compared to approximately $2 million in
1994, and lower uncollectible accounts and pension expense during 1994.  See
Note (M) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for information regarding
work force reduction programs instituted in the first quarter of 1994 by
GEORGIA and SCS.

   Maintenance expenses decreased because of the timing of scheduled
maintenance.  The reduction in taxes other than income taxes was related to
lower revenues.  Income taxes in the third quarter of 1993 were higher because
GEORGIA recorded additional income tax expense in 1993 in response to the
retroactive federal tax increase enacted in August 1993.

OTHER INCOME
In the third quarter of 1993, GEORGIA recognized a pre-tax loss of
approximately $10 million related to the impending shut-down of a coal receipt
and delivery facility.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction and is included in rate base.  The equity portion of AFUDC
represents non-cash income.  The amount of AFUDC has increased because of
GEORGIA's increased investment in the construction of combustion turbine
peaking units and, because of the rise in short-term interest rates, an
increase in the rate at which AFUDC is computed.  Four of these peaking units
began commercial operation in 1994 with the other four units scheduled for
completion in 1995.  Based upon GEORGIA's construction budget, AFUDC is
estimated to total $19 million in 1994 and $27 million in 1995.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

INTEREST CHARGES AND DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED STOCK
Interest charges and preferred stock dividends have declined due to recent
refinancing efforts.  Also, GEORGIA used the proceeds from the Plant Scherer
sales in 1993 and 1994 to redeem high cost securities.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings.  The level of future earnings is contingent upon numerous
factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.  Growth in
energy sales is subject to a number of factors which traditionally have
included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation
practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather, competition, and the
rate of economic growth in GEORGIA's service area.

    Pursuant to an Integrated Resource Plan approved by the Georgia PSC,
GEORGIA has implemented various demand-side option programs and had been
authorized by the Georgia PSC to recover associated program costs through rate
riders.  In October 1993, a superior court judge ruled that recovery of these
costs through rate riders was unlawful.  GEORGIA ceased collection of the rate
riders and the Georgia PSC allowed the deferral of program costs pending the
final outcome of this matter.  In July 1994, the Georgia Court of Appeals
reversed the lower court's ruling concerning the rate riders.  For additional
information on this matter, see Note (H) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein.

    The IRS has notified SOUTHERN that its tax accounting for the sale by
GEORGIA of a portion of Plant Vogtle in 1984 was improper.  The potential tax
deficiency and interest arising from this issue amount to approximately $30
million and $33 million, respectively.  The tax deficiency relates to a timing
issue as to when taxes are paid, therefore only the interest could impact
future income.  In September 1994, GEORGIA deposited $46 million with the IRS
to prevent additional interest charges should GEORGIA's position on this issue
not prevail.  See Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
further discussion of this matter.

    In compliance with the recently enacted Georgia Hazardous Site Response
Act, the State of Georgia was required to compile an inventory of all sites
where hazardous wastes, constituents or substances have been disposed or
released in quantities deemed reportable by the State.  In developing this
list, the State of Georgia identified several hundred properties throughout the
State, including 24 sites which may require environmental remediation by
GEORGIA.  If all sites were required to be remediated, GEORGIA could incur
expenses of up to $23 million in additional clean-up costs and construction
expenditures of up to $100 million.  See Note (K) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for further information on this matter.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

    The addition of new peaking capacity in 1994 and 1995, as well as the Rocky
Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project in 1995, will result in increased
operation, maintenance and depreciation expense.  GEORGIA is scheduled to sell
its remaining ownership interest (16.55%) in Plant Scherer Unit 4 to Florida
Power & Light and the Jacksonville Electric Authority in June 1995.  This
transaction will generate approximately $130 million in cash, including an
estimated after-tax gain of approximately $10 million.  This transaction
coincides with scheduled reductions in capacity revenues from these utilities
under wholesale power contracts of approximately $19 million in 1995 and an
additional $11 million in 1996.

    During the third quarter of 1994, OPC gave GEORGIA notice, as contractually
required, of its intent to decrease its purchases of capacity under a power
supply agreement.  As a result, GEORGIA's capacity revenues from OPC will
decline approximately $7.5 million in 1996 and an additional $15.5 million in
1997.

    OPC and MEAG have filed joint complaints in two separate venues seeking to
recover from GEORGIA approximately $16.5 million in alleged overcharges, plus
approximately $6.3 million in interest.   See Note (J) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for further discussion of this matter.

    The enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the future
of the electric utility industry.  A discussion of the potential impact of the
Energy Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future
Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis in 
GEORGIA's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    The FERC has initiated proceedings concerning the equity returns on
wholesale power and transmission contracts.  Management does not believe that
the final outcome of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on
earnings.  See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
further information on this matter.

    As described in Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein,
GEORGIA faces an uncertainty with respect to the actions of regulators
regarding the recovery of GEORGIA's investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped
storage hydroelectric project.

    The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition,
measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating
stations in financial statements.  In response to these questions, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board has decided to review the accounting for
nuclear decommissioning.  If current electric utility industry practices for
such decommissioning costs are changed: (1) annual provisions for
decommissioning could increase and (2) the total estimated cost for
decommissioning may be required to be recorded as a liability on the balance

sheet.  GEORGIA does not believe that such changes, if required, would have a
significant adverse effect on results of operations due to its current and
expected future ability to recover decommissioning costs through rates.
Further discussion of nuclear decommissioning costs is made in Note (C) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The principal changes in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first nine
months of 1994 were additions of $420 million to utility plant, the commercial
operation of four 80-megawatt combustion turbine peaking units, the sale of a
portion of Plant Scherer Unit 4 and recognition of the liability associated
with the implementation of work force reduction programs.  The funds needed for
gross property additions are currently provided from operations.  See GEORGIA's
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
Estimated construction expenditures for the years 1994 through 1996 are $688
million, $551 million and $489 million, respectively.  These estimated
expenditures reflect planned but unidentified reductions of $63 million in 1995
and $85 million in 1996 under GEORGIA's business strategy to curtail growth in
costs.  Additionally, these estimated construction expenditures reflect
reductions of $4 million in 1995 and $140 million in 1996 as a result of
GEORGIA canceling the construction of eight combustion turbine generating units
originally scheduled for completion by 1997.

    The Clean Air Act will have a significant impact on the capital
requirements of the Southern electric system.  This legislation, as well as
other legislation and regulations are described under "Environmental Issues" in
Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in GEORGIA's 1993 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

    As a result of requirements by the NRC, GEORGIA has established external
sinking funds for the purpose of funding nuclear decommissioning costs.  For
1994 through 1996, the amount to be funded for GEORGIA totals $16 million
annually.  For additional information concerning nuclear decommissioning costs,
see Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein.

    Cash requirements for long-term debt maturities and redemptions total
approximately $253 million for the twelve months ending September 30, 1995.
Short-term debt at quarter-end totaled $383 million.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  (Continued)

SOURCES OF FUNDS

GEORGIA expects to meet future capital requirements primarily using funds from
operations and, if needed, by the issuance of new debt and equity securities,
term loans and short-term borrowings.  Cash from operations for the first nine
months of 1994 decreased, as compared to the corresponding period in 1993,
primarily because of the receipt in 1993 of cash payments from Gulf States as
partial settlement of litigation and higher estimated income tax payments in
1994.  The $46 million GEORGIA deposited with the IRS to prevent additional
interest charges related to the tax accounting for the property sale in 1984
was recorded in Other Property and Investments on the balance sheet.

    GEORGIA must comply with coverage requirements of its mortgage indenture
and corporate charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.
GEORGIA's ability to satisfy all coverage requirements is such that it could
issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock to provide sufficient funds
for all anticipated requirements.

    To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had approximately
$473 million of unused credit arrangements with banks at September 30, 1994.
Additionally, the completion of the remaining transaction for the sale of Plant
Scherer Unit 4 will generate approximately $130 million in 1995.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO GEORGIA POWER COMPANY:

    We have reviewed the accompanying condensed balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER
COMPANY (a Georgia corporation) as of September 30, 1994, and the related
condensed statements of income for the three-month, nine-month and twelve-month
periods ended September 30, 1994 and 1993, and the condensed statements of cash
flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 1994 and 1993.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

    We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of
which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken
as a whole.  Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

    Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

    As more fully discussed in Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements,
an uncertainty exists with respect to the actions of the regulators regarding
the recoverability of the Company's investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped
storage hydroelectric project.  The outcome of this uncertainty cannot
presently be determined.  Accordingly, no provision for any writedown of the
costs associated with the Rocky Mountain facility resulting from the potential
actions of the Georgia Public Service Commission has been made in the
accompanying Condensed Financial Statements.

    We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the balance sheet of GEORGIA POWER COMPANY as of December 31, 1993
(not presented herein), and, in our report dated February 16, 1994, we included
an explanatory paragraph which describes an uncertainty with respect to the
actions of the regulators regarding the recoverability of the Company's
investment in the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project.  In our
opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed balance sheet
as of December 31, 1993, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
relation to the balance sheet from which it has been derived.

                               GULF POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS
GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter of
1994 was $21.8 million, compared to $22.4 million for the same period of 1993.
The decline in earnings was primarily due to lower revenues partially offset by
lower operation expenses and capital costs.

REVENUES
Retail energy sales for the third quarter of 1994 decreased 5.6% from the
corresponding period of 1993 due primarily to the mild temperatures experienced
during the summer of 1994 in contrast to a hotter than normal summer of 1993.
Also, energy sales were reduced because GULF's formerly largest industrial
customer began operating its co-generation facility in August 1993.  Wholesale
energy sales to non-affiliates decreased 1.0% with capacity revenues $1.2
million lower, compared to the third quarter of 1993.

EXPENSES
Fuel expenses for the third quarter of 1994 decreased compared to the same
period of 1993 due to a 13.6% decrease in generation.  Additionally, because
GULF renegotiated, bought out or otherwise terminated various coal supply
contracts, the average cost of fuel consumed decreased.  Purchased power
transactions (both sales and purchases) among the affiliated companies within
the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generation at each company.  Other
operation expenses decreased because of the reduction of costs associated with
the buyouts and renegotiation of coal supply contracts.  The expenses
recognized are based, in part, on the amount of fuel consumed at the generating
plants.  These costs are recoverable through the fuel clause and, thus, have no
impact on earnings.  Also, other operation expenses decreased due to a
reduction in expenses related to employee benefits.  Additionally, the third
quarter of 1993 included the one-time costs associated with a automobile fleet
reduction program.  The decrease in income tax expense is attributable to lower
earnings.

INTEREST CHARGES AND DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED STOCK
The decrease in interest on long-term debt reflects GULF's efforts to decrease
its capital costs.  GULF, in response to the low interest rate levels
prevailing during 1992 and 1993, refinanced a significant portion of its
long-term debt and preferred stock.  To the extent it is economically feasible,
GULF will continue its efforts to lower its capital costs.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

    Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, customer growth, and the rate of economic growth in GULF's service
area.  The enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the
future of the electric utility industry.  A discussion of the potential impact
of the Energy Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under
"Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
GULF's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for a discussion
of the hearings ordered by the FERC regarding the reasonableness of the return
on common equity on certain of the Southern electric system's wholesale rate
schedules and contracts.  Also, see Note (L) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for a discussion of the settlement of a suit filed against
GULF concerning fuel transportation.

    Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could reduce earnings if such
increased costs are not fully recovered.  The Clean Air Act is discussed
further under  "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in GULF's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  See Note 3 to the
financial statements in Item 8 in GULF's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Environmental Cost Recovery clause which provides for the
expected recovery of such costs.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first nine months of
1994 were gross property additions of $63.3 million and the settlement of
litigation related to fuel transportation.  The principal sources of funds for
these additions and other capital requirements were provided from operations
and an increase in notes payable.  See the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
for further details.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION
GULF's gross property additions, including those amounts related to
environmental compliance, are estimated to total approximately $219 million for
the three years 1994 through 1996 ($81 million in 1994, $62 million in 1995 and
$76 million in 1996).  The estimates of property additions for the three-year
period include $23 million committed to meeting the requirements of the Clean
Air Act, the cost of which is expected to be recovered through the
Environmental Cost Recovery clause.  Actual construction costs may vary from
these estimates because of factors such as the granting of timely and adequate
rate increases, changes in environmental regulations, revised load projections,
the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials, and
the cost of capital.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION (Continued)

    Various environmental legislation and other related regulations are
described in "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in GULF's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The full impact of these
requirements cannot be determined at this time, pending the development and
implementation of applicable regulations.

    In addition to the funds required for the construction program, $56.4
million will be required by September 30, 1995, in connection with maturities
and redemptions of long-term debt and preferred stock subject to mandatory
redemption.  This amount includes approximately $42.0 million of pollution
control bonds that have been refinanced and will be redeemed December 1, 1994.
The funds for these redemptions are on deposit with the Trustee and are
designated for that purpose only.

    At September 30, 1994, GULF had $0.9 million of cash and $67.3 million of
unused credit arrangements with banks to meet its short-term cash needs.  GULF
had $27.5 million of short-term bank borrowings outstanding at quarter-end.

    It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be derived
from operations, the sale of additional first mortgage bonds and preferred
stock, and capital contributions from SOUTHERN.  GULF is required to meet
certain coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate
charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.  GULF's coverage
ratios are sufficient to permit, at present interest rate levels, any
foreseeable security sales.  The amount of securities which GULF will be
permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market conditions and other
factors prevailing at that time.

                           MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NET INCOME
MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third
quarter of 1994 was $21.4 million, compared to $16.6 million for the
corresponding period of 1993.  Net income rose primarily because of lower other
operation expenses and capital costs.

REVENUES
Revenues for the third quarter of 1994 decreased, compared to the same period
of 1993, because of milder than normal weather during the summer of 1994. 
Because of lower demand for both MISSISSIPPI and the SOUTHERN system,
MISSISSIPPI relied on its most cost efficient generating facilities and had
access to lower cost energy from other sources, which translated into lower
fuel clause revenues.  Despite the milder temperatures during the summer of
1994, contrasted with above average temperatures in the summer of 1993, retail
energy sales increased 0.7% and territorial wholesale energy sales increased
0.6%.  These increased energy sales reflect an improving economy in coastal
Mississippi due in large measure to an increasing number of casinos and
ancillary services and the attendant rise in personal income.  Energy sales to
industrial customers increased 5.9%.

EXPENSES
Fuel and purchased power expense declined in the third quarter of 1994 due to
weather effects during the summer months.  The cooler temperatures resulted in
less purchases of energy and fuel.  Fuel expenses also decreased because of the
lower average cost of fuel consumed.  Purchased power transactions (both sales
and purchases) among the affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system will vary from period to period depending on demand and the availability
and cost of generation at each company.

    Other operation expenses decreased due to lower sales, marketing and
administrative expenses, reduced billings from the system service company,
decreased expenses associated with a fuel supply contract buyout, and, in
response to updated actuarial estimates, lower pension and other postretirement
benefit costs.  Taxes other than income taxes increased because of additions to
utility plant.  The increase in income tax expense reflects the increase in
earnings.  The decrease in interest expense was due primarily to refinancings.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction.  The equity portion of AFUDC represents non-cash income.
However, when facilities are completed and included in rate base, previously
capitalized amounts increase cash flow because revenues are higher as a result
of the increased rate base and additional depreciation expense.  In May 1994,
MISSISSIPPI began commercial operation of a 74.6-megawatt combustion turbine
unit whose entire output is dedicated to a single industrial customer.  The
recording of AFUDC for a construction project ceases upon commercial operation
of the project.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

OTHER INCOME
Included in "Other, net" for the third quarter of 1994 is $1.0 million to fund
a program to encourage employee use of electric products and upgrade energy
efficiency.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings is contingent upon
numerous factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.
Operating revenues will be affected by changes in rates under the PEP and ECO
plans.  The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force on electric rates, with
only moderate changes in rates taking place.  Also see Note (B) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for information regarding FERC's review
of equity returns.

    MISSISSIPPI's 1994 annual filing under the ECO Plan with the Mississippi
PSC resulted in an approved annual revenue requirement increase of $7.6
million, effective in April 1994.  The FERC approved MISSISSIPPI's wholesale
rate increase petition for $3.6 million, effective April 1994.

    The Mississippi PSC has increased from $10.9 million to $18 million, the
maximum amount MISSISSIPPI may accumulate in its Property Damage Reserve.  The
monthly accrual for this reserve did not change.

    MISSISSIPPI initiated an early retirement incentive program in April 1994.
The costs associated with this program, as well as MISSISSIPPI's pro rata share
of a similar program at SCS, have been deferred.  For further information on
these programs and the accounting treatment, see Note (M) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein.

    Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors
have included the rate of economic growth in MISSISSIPPI's service area,
customer growth, competition, weather, changes in contracts with neighboring
utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, and the elasticity of
demand.  The enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the
future of the electric utility industry.  A discussion of the potential impact
of the Energy Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under
"Future Earnings Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in
MISSISSIPPI's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
During the first nine months of 1994, gross property additions were $81.2
million.  The funds for these additions and other capital requirements,
including refundings, were derived primarily from internal sources, the sale of
$35 million of first mortgage bonds, the issuance of $50 million of long-term
notes

payable and the receipt of $25 million in capital contributions from SOUTHERN.
See the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

    At September 30, 1994, cash totaled approximately $1.1 million and
MISSISSIPPI had $96.5 million of unused credit arrangements with banks to meet
short-term cash needs.  MISSISSIPPI had $25 million of notes payable
outstanding at quarter-end.  It is MISSISSIPPI's strategy to maintain a
permanent layer of short-term debt, approximately $40 million through the end
of 1994, consistent with its overall risk capital strategy.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
MISSISSIPPI's gross property additions for the next three years are estimated
to be $256 million ($96 million in 1994, $62 million in 1995 and $98 million in
1996).  The major emphasis within the construction program will be on complying
with Clean Air Act regulations and upgrading existing facilities.  Revisions
may be necessary because of factors such as revised load projections, the
availability and cost of capital and changes in environmental regulations.

    In addition to the funds required for the construction program,
approximately $41.1 million will be required by September 30, 1995, for
maturities of long-term debt.  It is anticipated that the funds required for
construction and other purposes, including compliance with environmental
regulations, will be derived from operations, the sale of additional first
mortgage bonds, pollution control bonds and preferred stock and the receipt of
additional capital contributions from SOUTHERN.  MISSISSIPPI is required to
meet certain coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and
corporate charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.
MISSISSIPPI's coverage ratios are sufficiently high to permit, at present
interest rate levels, any foreseeable security sales.  The amount of securities
which MISSISSIPPI will be able to issue in the future will depend upon market
conditions and other factors prevailing at that time.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the Southern
electric system's capital requirements and operating costs.  The acid rain
compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will have a significant impact on the
Southern electric system.  This legislation, as well as other legislation and
regulations, are described under "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 -
Management's Discussion and Analysis in MISSISSIPPI's 1993 Annual Report on
Form 10-K.  The full impact of these requirements cannot be determined at this
time pending the development MISSISSIPPI's management believes that the ECO
Plan will provide for retail recovery of the Clean Air Act costs.

    MISSISSIPPI must comply with environmental laws and regulations that cover
the handling and disposal of hazardous waste.  Under these various laws and
regulations, MISSISSIPPI could incur costs to clean up properties currently or
previously owned.  Upon identifying potential sites

FINANCIAL CONDITION  (Continued)

MISSISSIPPI conducts studies, when possible, to determine the extent of any
required clean-up costs.  Should remediation be determined to be probable,
reasonable estimates of costs to clean up such sites are developed and
recognized in the financial statements.  A currently owned site where
manufactured gas plant operations were located is under investigation for
potential remediation, but no prediction can presently be made regarding the
extent, if any, of contamination or possible cleanup.  If this site were
required to be remediated, industry studies show MISSISSIPPI could incur
clean-up costs of from $1.5 million to $10 million before giving consideration
of possible recovery of clean-up costs from other parties.

                      SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS
SAVANNAH's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter
of 1994 decreased to $9.5 million, compared to $10.2 million in the
corresponding period of 1993.  The decrease in net income was primarily due to
lower revenues and an increase in other operation expense and higher
depreciation charges.

REVENUES
Revenues for the third quarter of 1994 decreased, compared to the corresponding
period in 1993, because total energy sales dropped 8.2%.  Energy sales to
retail customers decreased 7.6% due to weather influences.  The summer of 1993
was exceptionally hot, compared to the generally typical temperatures this past
summer.  Wholesale energy sales to non-affiliated companies decreased, however,
only the capacity revenues of such sales have any measurable effect on
earnings.  Capacity revenues fell $140,000.

EXPENSES
Fuel expenses during the third quarter of 1994 decreased, compared to those
recorded in the third quarter of 1993, because of a 44.0% drop in generation,
reflecting lower demand and greater use of energy from affiliates, and less
generation from more expensive oil- and gas-fired generating units.  Purchased
power transactions (both sales and purchases) among the affiliated companies
within the Southern electric system will vary from period to period depending
on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company.  These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.
Other operation expenses increased because, in response to updated actuarial
estimates reflecting SAVANNAH's work force reductions program (see Note (M) to
the Condensed Financial Statements herein), SAVANNAH recognized additional
pension and other postretirement benefit costs and SAVANNAH also recorded
higher damage claims.  Depreciation and amortization increased because of
additions to utility plant, principally two combustion turbine peaking units.

    The increases in interest on long-term debt and dividends on preferred
stock reflect the sale by SAVANNAH in 1993 of $45 million of first mortgage
bonds and $35 million of preferred stock.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
AFUDC represents the cost of capital charged to utility plant under
construction and is included in rate base.  The equity portion of AFUDC
represents non-cash income.  In addition, when facilities are completed and
included in rate base, previously capitalized amounts increase cash flow
because revenues are higher as a result of the increased rate base and
additional depreciation expense.  The amount of AFUDC recorded has fallen
because the largest component of SAVANNAH's construction program, two
80-megawatt combustion turbine peaking units, were placed in service in April
and May 1994.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued)

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential.  The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from regulatory matters to growth in energy sales.

   Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act will reduce earnings if such
increased costs cannot be offset.  The Clean Air Act is discussed under
"Capital Requirements for Construction" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and
Analysis in SAVANNAH's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    Future earnings in the near term will also depend upon growth in electric
sales which are subject to a number of factors.  Traditionally, these factors
have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, and the rate of economic growth in SAVANNAH's service area.  The
enactment of the Energy Act will have a profound effect on the future of the
electric utility industry.  A discussion of the potential impact of the Energy
Act and particularly its effect on competition is found under "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SAVANNAH's 1993
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
During the first nine months of 1994, SAVANNAH made gross property additions to
utility plant of $24.0 million.  The funds for these additions and other
capital requirements came from an increase in short-term and long-term debt and
from operating activities, principally from earnings and noncash charges to
income such as depreciation.  See the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION
SAVANNAH's construction program is budgeted at $98 million for the three years
1994 through 1996 ($33 million in 1994, $32 million in 1995 and $33 million in
1996).  Actual construction costs may vary from this estimate because of such
factors as changes in environmental regulations; the cost and efficiency of
construction labor, equipment and materials; revised load projections and the
cost of capital.  The largest project during this period is the addition of two
80-megawatt combustion turbine units, which were placed in service in April and
May 1994.

         Changes in environmental regulations could substantially increase the
Southern electric system's capital requirements and operating costs.  The acid
rain compliance provision of the Clean Air Act will have a significant impact
on the Southern electric system.  This legislation, as well as other
legislation and regulations, are described under "Environmental Matters" in
Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis in SAVANNAH's 1993 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.  The full impact of these

FINANCIAL CONDITION  (Continued)

requirements cannot be determined at this time, pending the development and
implementation of applicable regulations.  There can be no assurance that
compliance costs will be recovered through corresponding increases in rates.

SOURCES OF CAPITAL
At September 30, 1994, SAVANNAH had $3.1 million in cash and cash equivalents
and $26 million of unused credit arrangements with banks to meet its short-term
cash needs.  SAVANNAH had $6 million of short-term debt outstanding at
quarter-end.  SAVANNAH has received the authority from the SEC to have
outstanding at any one time an amount of up to $70 million in short-term
borrowings.

    It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be derived
from operations and the sale of additional first mortgage bonds and preferred
stock and capital contributions from SOUTHERN.  SAVANNAH is required to meet
certain coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate
charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock.  SAVANNAH's
coverage ratios are sufficiently high to permit, at present interest rate
levels, any foreseeable security sales.  The amount of securities which
SAVANNAH will be permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market
conditions and other factors prevailing at that time.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)  Reference is made to Item 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS in the SOUTHERN system's
     combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993
     for a description of the proceedings related to a derivative action filed
     against certain current and former directors and officers of SOUTHERN.  In
     April 1994, the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded the
     case to the trial court, finding that allegations by the plaintiffs
     created a reasonable doubt that the board validly exercised its business
     judgment in refusing the earlier demand.

(B)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN,
     ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF and MISSISSIPPI in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's
     combined 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K for information concerning a
     proceeding initiated by the FERC regarding the reasonableness of the
     Southern electric system's wholesale rate schedules and contracts that
     have a return on common equity of 13.75 percent or greater.  The refund
     period under that proceeding ended in October 1992.  In August 1994, the
     FERC instituted a second such proceeding involving substantially the same
     issues.  A new period for potential refunds commenced under this
     proceeding in October 1994, and will continue until January 1996, unless
     the proceeding is terminated prior to such time.

(C)  For information regarding the expected costs of decommissioning nuclear
     facilities reference is made to Note (C) to the Condensed Financial
     Statements in the SOUTHERN system's combined Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
     for March 31, 1994.

(D)  For information regarding nuclear insurance reference is made to Notes 13,
     11 and 4 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and GEORGIA,
     respectively, in Item 8 in the SOUTHERN system's combined 1993 Annual
     Report on Form 10-K and Note (D) to the Condensed Financial Statements in
     the SOUTHERN system's combined Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for March 31,
     1994.  During the second quarter of 1994, the by-laws of Nuclear Mutual
     Limited were amended whereby a member cannot receive a refund in the event
     insurance coverage is terminated.

(E)  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
     ALABAMA in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1993 Annual Report on
     Form 10-K for information with respect to a civil complaint filed
     regarding ALABAMA's financing of heat pumps and other merchandise.

(F)  Pursuant to orders from the Georgia PSC, GEORGIA deferred financing and
     depreciation costs under phase-in plans for Plant Vogtle units 1 and 2
     until the allowed investment was fully reflected in rates as of October
     1991.  In addition, the Georgia PSC issued two separate accounting

<PAGE>   71



NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)

     orders that required GEORGIA to defer substantially all operating and
     financing costs related to both units until rate orders addressed these
     costs.  The Georgia PSC orders provide for recovery of deferred costs
     within 10 years.  The Georgia PSC also ordered GEORGIA to levelize
     declining capacity buyback expense from the co-owners of the plant over a
     six-year period beginning October 1991.  The unamortized balance of these
     deferred costs at September 30, 1994, was $456 million.

(G)  Reference is made to Note 4 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
     GEORGIA in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN system's combined 1993 Annual Report on
     Form 10-K for information concerning the uncertainty related to the
     actions of regulatory authorities with respect to the recovery of costs of
     the Rocky Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric project.  With respect to
     the possible sale of GEORGIA's remaining interest in the Rocky Mountain
     project, as disclosed in the 1993 Form 10-K, such preliminary discussions
     have ceased and GEORGIA currently plans to retain its interest in the
     project.  The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this
     time.

(H)  In October 1993, a Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, judge ruled
     that rate riders previously approved by the Georgia PSC for recovery of
     GEORGIA's costs incurred in connection with demand-side conservation
     programs were unlawful.  The judge held that the Georgia PSC lacked
     statutory authority to approve such rate riders except through general
     rate case proceedings and that those procedures had not been followed.
     GEORGIA suspended collection of the demand-side conservation costs and
     appealed to the Georgia Court of Appeals, which reversed the court's
     decision as described below.  In December 1993, the Georgia PSC approved
     GEORGIA's request for an accounting order allowing GEORGIA to defer all
     current unrecovered and future costs related to these programs until the
     legal issues are resolved or until the next general rate case proceeding.
     An association of industrial customers has filed a petition for review of
     such accounting order in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia.
     GEORGIA's costs related to these conservation programs through September
     1994 were $104 million of which $15 million has been collected and the
     remainder deferred.  The estimated costs are $11 million for the remainder
     of 1994 and $43 million in 1995.

        In July 1994, the Georgia Court of Appeals, reversing the superior
     court decision discussed above, ruled that the Georgia PSC could lawfully
     provide for recovery of demand-side conservation program costs through
     rate riders.  The opposing parties have filed appeals to the Georgia
     Supreme Court.  GEORGIA is continuing to defer program costs pending final
     resolution of this matter.

        The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined; however, in
     management's opinion, the final outcome will not have a material adverse
     effect on SOUTHERN's or GEORGIA's Condensed Financial Statements.

(I)  In June 1994, a tax deficiency notice was received from the IRS for the
     years 1984 through 1987 in regards to the tax accounting by GEORGIA for a
     1984 property transaction.  The potential tax deficiency arising from this
     issue would amount to approximately $30 million of tax plus an





                                      71
<PAGE>   72



NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)

     additional $33 million of interest.  The tax deficiency relates to a
     timing issue as to when taxes are paid, therefore only the interest
     portion could impact future income.  Management believes that the IRS
     position is incorrect and has filed a petition with the United States Tax
     Court to appeal the IRS position.  In September 1994, GEORGIA deposited
     $46 million with the IRS to prevent additional interest charges should
     GEORGIA's position on this issue not prevail.  The final outcome of this
     matter cannot now be determined; however, in management's opinion, the
     final outcome will not have a material adverse effect on SOUTHERN's or
     GEORGIA's Condensed Financial Statements.

(J)  In July 1994, OPC and MEAG filed a joint complaint with the FERC seeking
     to recover from GEORGIA an aggregate of approximately $16.5 million in
     alleged partial requirements rates overcharges, plus approximately $6.3
     million in interest.  OPC and MEAG claimed that GEORGIA improperly
     reflected in such rates costs associated with capacity that had previously
     been sold to Gulf States pursuant to a unit power sales contract or,
     alternatively, that they should be allocated a portion of the proceeds
     received by GEORGIA as the result of a settlement with Gulf States of
     litigation arising out of such contract.  (For information concerning the
     Gulf States settlement, see Note 8 and Note 3, respectively, to the
     financial statements of SOUTHERN and GEORGIA in Item 8 of the SOUTHERN
     system's combined 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.)  GEORGIA's response
     sought dismissal of the complaint by FERC, which dismissal was ordered on
     November 9, 1994.  In August 1994, OPC and MEAG also filed a complaint in
     the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, urging substantially the
     same claims and asking the court to hear the matter in the event the FERC
     declines jurisdiction.  Such court proceeding was subsequently stayed
     pending resolution of the FERC filing.  While the outcome of this matter
     cannot be determined, in management's opinion it will not have a material
     adverse effect on SOUTHERN's or GEORGIA's financial condition.

(K)  In compliance with the recently enacted Georgia Hazardous Site Response
     Act, the State of Georgia was required to compile an inventory of all
     known or suspected sites where hazardous wastes, constituents or
     substances have been disposed of or released in quantities deemed
     reportable by the State.  In developing this list, the State of Georgia
     identified several hundred properties throughout the State, including 24
     sites which may require environmental remediation by GEORGIA.  The
     majority of these sites are electrical power substations and power
     generation facilities.  GEORGIA has recognized $4 million in expenses for
     the anticipated clean-up cost for two sites that GEORGIA plans to
     remediate.  GEORGIA will conduct studies at each of the remaining sites to
     determine the extent of remediation and associated clean-up costs, if any,
     that may be required.  GEORGIA has recognized $3 million in expenses for
     the anticipated cost of completing such studies.  Any cost of remediating
     the remaining sites cannot presently be determined until such studies are
     completed for each site, and the State of Georgia determines whether
     remediation is required.  If all sites were required to be remediated,
     GEORGIA could incur expenses of up to $23 million in additional clean-up
     costs, and construction expenditures of up to $100 million to develop new
     waste management facilities or install additional pollution control
     devices.  The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined;
     however, in management's opinion the final outcome will not have a
     material adverse effect on SOUTHERN's or GEORGIA's Condensed Financial
     Statements.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)

(L)  In August 1993, a complaint against GULF and SCS was filed in federal
     district court in Ohio by two companies with which GULF had contracted for
     the transportation by barge of certain of GULF's coal supplies.  The
     complaint alleged breach of the contract by GULF and sought damages
     estimated by the plaintiffs to be in excess of $85 million.  In August
     1994, such complaint was dismissed with prejudice by the court in
     connection with the execution by the parties of a mutually acceptable
     amendment to the transportation agreement, and this matter is now
     concluded.

(M)  During 1994, GEORGIA and SCS, the system service company, instituted work
     force reduction programs.  The costs related to these programs amounted to
     approximately $82.1 million for GEORGIA and $17.0 million for SCS.  The
     costs of the SCS work force reduction program were apportioned among the
     various entities that together form the Southern electric system.
     MISSISSIPPI instituted an early retirement incentive program in April 1994
     and deferred the related costs of approximately $12.9 million.
     MISSISSIPPI has received authority from the Mississippi PSC to defer these
     costs, as well as its portion of the costs of a similar SCS program, and
     to amortize over a period not to exceed 60 months, beginning no later than
     January 1995.  Additionally, SAVANNAH instituted a work force reduction
     program in late 1993 and incurred related charges of approximately $4.5
     million.

(N)  In September 1994, in response to a request by ALABAMA, the Alabama PSC
     issued an order allowing ALABAMA to establish a Natural Disaster Reserve
     in an amount not to exceed $32 million.  Additionally, the order permits
     ALABAMA to change the estimating procedure for unbilled kilowatt-hours and
     associated revenues.  This change in estimate resulted in an increase in
     unbilled revenues of approximately $28 million which offset the initial
     accrual for the Natural Disaster Reserve for the same amount.  ALABAMA
     will accrue an additional $250,000 monthly until the reserve maximum is
     attained.  ALABAMA further requested and was so ordered to forego any
     increase under Rate RSE (see Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8
     of ALABAMA's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K) through the July 1995 test.

PART II       -     OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.             Legal Proceedings.

              (1)  Reference is made to the Notes to Condensed Financial
                   Statements herein for information regarding certain legal
                   and administrative proceedings in which SOUTHERN and its
                   reporting subsidiaries are involved.

              (2)  In May 1994, GEORGIA received a notice of violation from the
                   NRC proposing a civil penalty in the amount of $200,000
                   based upon allegedly inaccurate and incomplete information
                   relating to Plant Vogtle reported to the NRC in 1990.  The
                   NRC also issued demands for information regarding alleged
                   performance failures by six individual employees to enable
                   the NRC to determine whether additional enforcement actions
                   are necessary.

                       In its responses to the notice of violation, submitted
                   to the NRC in August 1994, GEORGIA denied certain of the 
                   NRC's allegations and admitted others.  GEORGIA further
                   requested reconsideration of the level of the proposed civil
                   penalty.  GEORGIA has also furnished various information to
                   the NRC in response to the demands described above.

Item 4.            Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

                   ALABAMA

                   ALABAMA held a special meeting of stockholders on September
                   21, 1994, and the following proposals were voted upon:

              (1)  A proposal to increase on a permanent basis the permissible
                   amount of securities representing unsecured short-term debt
                   from the existing 10% charter limitation to a 20% 
                   restriction on all securities representing unsecured debt 
                   was approved.  The vote tabulation was as follows:
