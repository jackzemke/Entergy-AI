     This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking and historical
information. Forward-looking information includes, among other things,
statements concerning capital requirements, expected capacity payments and
Southern Power's commercial paper balances, commercial paper as a percentage of

terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expects," "plans,"
"anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "projects," "predicts," "potential" or
"continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. The
registrants caution that there are various important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking
statements; accordingly, there can be no assurance that such indicated results
will be realized. These factors include the impact of recent and future federal
and state regulatory change, including legislative and regulatory initiatives
regarding deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry and
also changes in environmental, tax and other laws and regulations to which
Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject, as well as changes in
application of existing laws and regulations; current and future litigation,
including the pending EPA civil actions against certain Southern Company
subsidiaries; the effects, extent and timing of the entry of additional

non-traditional business and the success of efforts to invest in and develop new
opportunities; internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may be
pursued; potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions
of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial
to Southern Company or its subsidiaries; the ability of counterparties of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries to make payments as and when due; the
effects of, and changes in, economic conditions in the areas in which Southern
Company's subsidiaries operate, including the current soft economy; the direct
or indirect effects on Southern Company's business resulting from the terrorist

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   THIRD QUARTER 2003 vs. THIRD QUARTER 2002
                                       AND
                     YEAR-TO-DATE 2003 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 2002

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Southern Company is focusing on three main businesses in
the Southeast: its traditional business, represented by its five operating
companies providing regulated retail electric service in four states; a growing
competitive generation business in the Super Southeast; and energy-related
products and services for its retail customers. For additional information on
these businesses, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - The SOUTHERN System - "Operating
Companies," "Southern Power" and "Other Business" in the Form 10-K.

Earnings

Southern Company's third quarter and year-to-date 2003 earnings were
$619 million ($0.85 per share) and $1.35 billion ($1.86 per share),
respectively, compared with $595 million ($0.84 per share) and $1.15 billion
($1.63 per share) in the third quarter and year-to-date 2002. Earnings in the
third quarter 2003 increased due to a number of positive factors including
growth in the number of customers in the Southern Company service area,
successful efforts to control costs and strong results from Southern Company's
competitive generation business. Earnings from the competitive generation
business increased due to the combination of (1) hydro and coal-fired generating
capacity available as a result of the mild summer weather in Southern Company's
retail service area and (2) higher prices for natural gas, which made this
capacity more competitive in the wholesale markets. Year-to-date 2003 earnings
include a one-time after-tax gain of $88 million in the second quarter of 2003
from the termination of PPAs between Southern Company subsidiaries, Mississippi
Power and Southern Power, and subsidiaries of Dynegy. Reference is made to Note
(N) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information.
Year-to-date 2003 earnings were also positively impacted by regulatory rate
proceedings in Alabama and Florida which took effect in April 2002 and June
2002, respectively.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue decreased by $8.4 million, or 0.4%, in the third
quarter 2003 and increased by $31.6 million, or 0.7%, year-to-date 2003 when
compared to the same periods in 2002. In the third quarter and year-to-date
2003, retail kilowatt-hour energy sales decreased by 1.4% and 0.3%,
respectively, primarily due to mild weather when compared to the same periods in
2002. The year-to-date 2003 revenue increase is primarily attributed to retail
rate increases at Alabama Power and Gulf Power in April 2002 and June 2002,
respectively.

     Sales for resale. During the third quarter 2003, sales for resale was
higher when compared to the same period in the prior year. Revenues from the
competitive generation business increased due to the combination of (1) hydro
and coal-fired generating capacity available as a result of the mild summer
weather in Southern Company's retail service area and (2) higher prices for
natural gas, which made this capacity more competitive in the wholesale markets.
Further contributing to the year-to-date increase were increased sales of
wholesale capacity and energy as a result of new plants placed into service by
Southern Power in June 2002 and June 2003.

     Other electric revenues. The increase in other electric revenues
year-to-date 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002 is primarily due to
$144 million in revenues recorded upon the termination of PPAs with Dynegy and,
to a lesser extent, revenues from cogeneration steam facilities. Since
cogeneration steam revenues are generally offset by fuel expenses, these
revenues do not have a significant impact on earnings. See Note (N) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for further information on the termination
of the Dynegy PPAs.

     Other revenues. In the third quarter and year-to-date 2003, other revenues
increased primarily due to revenues from Southern Company GAS, which began
operations in August 2002. In addition, revenues from alternative fuel product
services and, to a lesser degree, energy services also contributed to the
overall increase between years. The increase in revenues from alternative fuel
product services is due to increased production as a result of relocating one of
the units.

     Fuel expense. During the third quarter and year-to-date 2003, fuel expense
was higher due to an increase in the average unit cost of fuel. Year-to-date
2003, the average unit cost of fuel per net kilowatt-hour generated increased
9.6%. Fuel expense year-to-date 2003 also increased due to the commercial
operation of Southern Power's new units in June 2002 and 2003 and the
acquisition of Southern Company GAS in the third quarter of 2002. Increases in
fuel expense at the operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues
and do not affect net income.

     Purchased power expense. Purchased power decreased in the third quarter
2003 primarily due to the mild summer weather and the commercial operation of
Southern Power's new units in June 2003. Year-to-date 2003 purchased power
expense increased due to the availability of power at prices lower than the cost
of self-generation and the effects of purchase power provisions in certain of
Southern Power's contracts. Increases in purchased power expenses at the
operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not affect net
income.

     Other operations expense. The decrease in other operations expense in the
third quarter 2003 is mainly attributed to lower administrative and general
expense resulting from efforts to control costs. The year-to-date 2003 increase
in other operations expense is mainly attributed to the acquisition of Southern
Company GAS, which began operations in August 2002, and the commercial operation
of new generating units at Gulf Power in April 2002 and Southern Power in June
2002 and 2003. In addition, higher administrative and general expenses related
to property insurance, employee benefits and approximately $11 million of costs
incurred in conjunction with restructuring Mississippi Power's lease agreement

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

for the combined cycle generating units at Plant Daniel contributed to the
year-to-date increase.  Reference is made to Note (S) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for additional information on Mississippi Power's
restructured lease agreement.

     Taxes other than income taxes. The third quarter and year-to-date 2003
increases are primarily due to higher property taxes on additional plant placed
in service and municipal gross receipts taxes on increased revenues when
compared to the corresponding periods in 2002.

     Interest income. Interest income in the third quarter 2003 decreased when
compared to the same period in 2002 due to interest on an income tax refund
recorded in 2002. The year-to-date 2003 increase when compared to the
corresponding period in 2002 is primarily a result of a favorable tax settlement
related to IRS audits for the years 1988 through 1999, excluding 1993 through
1995, recorded in the second quarter of 2003.

     Equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Losses from unconsolidated
subsidiaries decreased in the third quarter 2003 and increased year-to-date 2003
when compared to the corresponding periods in 2002. These losses relate to
Southern Company's investments in entities that produce synthetic fuel. Changes
between periods are a result of fluctuations in production levels and are offset
by income tax credits generated by such entities. See Note (D) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for further information on Southern Company's
investments in these entities and IRS reviews of the related tax credits.

     Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. In the third quarter and
year-to-date 2003, the increases in interest expense, net of amounts
capitalized, are mainly attributed to less interest cost being capitalized as
projects have reached completion and an increase in the amount of senior notes
outstanding when compared to the same periods in 2002.

     Distributions on shares subject to mandatory redemption. The decreases in
the third quarter and year-to-date 2003 are primarily related to the refinancing
of higher distribution rate trust preferred securities since the corresponding
periods in 2002 and the redemption of $200 million of these securities in the
first half of 2003.

     Other income (expense), net. The year-to-date 2003 decrease in this expense
is primarily attributed to unrealized gains on derivative energy contracts when
compared to the same period in the prior year. See "Exposure to Market Risks"
herein for additional information on derivative energy contracts.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors. The two major factors are the ability of the operating companies to
maintain a stable regulatory environment and achieve energy sales growth while
containing costs and the profitability of the competitive market-based wholesale
generating business. For additional information relating to these issues, see
Item 1 - BUSINESS - The SOUTHERN System - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of Southern
Company in the Form 10-K.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Legislative and Regulatory Matters

     Comprehensive energy legislation has been passed by both the U.S. House of
Representatives and the Senate. Significant differences exist in the legislation
and a joint conference is underway to formulate a compromise final bill. While
the form of this final bill is not yet known, it is expected to address a number
of issues related to the electric utility industry and could affect the business
operations and financial condition of Southern Company and its subsidiaries.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For
additional information about these issues, including the EPA litigation, see
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note
3 to the financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and
Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein. On October 27, 2003, the
EPA published a final rule providing that certain equipment replacements be
excluded from New Source Review and Prevention of Significant Deterioration
provisions of the Clean Air Act under the definition of "routine maintenance,
repair and replacement." The final rules must be adopted by the states in
Southern Company's service area in order to apply to facilities in the Southern
Company system. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

     Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. On September 26, 2003, the EPA published a
final rule in the Federal Register, formally reclassifying the Atlanta area
effective January 1, 2004 as a "severe" nonattainment area for the one-hour
ozone standard under Title I of the Clean Air Act. If the Atlanta area fails to
comply with the one-hour standard by November 2005, all major sources of
nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds located in the nonattainment
area, including Georgia Power's Plants McDonough and Yates, could be subject to
payment of emissions fees for nitrogen oxides emitted above 80% of the baseline
period. The baseline period is currently unknown. Based on average emissions at
these units over the past three years, such fees could potentially reach $23
million annually. However, Georgia Power does not anticipate exceeding 80% of
the baseline and, therefore, does not anticipate incurring any such fees. The
final outcome of this matter will depend on the development and implementation
of applicable regulations.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Southern Company in the Form 10-K
for information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice
of proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Reactions to
the White Paper by Southeastern state regulators reflect significant continuing
differences in opinion between the FERC and various state regulatory commissions
over questions of jurisdiction and protection of retail customers. These
significant differences between state and federal regulators create substantial
uncertainty related to the ultimate approval of SeTrans because state commission
approval of the transfer of operational control of the transmission assets of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries is a prerequisite to the formation of
SeTrans. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any impact of
the FERC proposals on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on the
form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Southern Company's
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities could be adversely affected by
changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its regional power market.

Mirant Matters

Reference is made to Note 11 to the financial statements of Southern Company in
Item 8 and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" in
Item 7 of the Form 10-K and to Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for information relating to Mirant. On July 14, 2003, Mirant filed for
voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
Southern Company has various contingent liabilities associated with Mirant,
including guarantees, litigation and joint and several liabilities in connection
with the consolidated federal income tax return, as well as related
indemnifications under the separation agreement. The ultimate outcome of such
contingent liabilities cannot now be determined. Furthermore, the impact of
Mirant's bankruptcy filing on its related indemnity obligations, if any, cannot
now be determined.

     On April 30, 2003, Mirant filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2002, which included its restated financial statements for
the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. The effect of these restatements on
Southern Company's financial statements, if any, cannot be determined until
Mirant's 2001 revised quarterly financial statements are filed. The impact of
the bankruptcy filing on the timing of filing 2001 revised quarterly financial
statements, if any, cannot now be determined. However, Southern Company's
management does not currently anticipate that a reaudit of Southern Company's
2000 or 2001 financial statements will be necessary.

Other Contingent Matters

     Southern Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in
the ordinary course of business. In addition, Southern Company's business
activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public
health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of
various types, including property damage, personal injury and citizen
enforcement of environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout
the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by
alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate
outcome of such litigation against Southern Company and its subsidiaries cannot
be predicted at this time; however, management does not anticipate that the
liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material
adverse effect on Southern Company's financial statements.

     Reference is made to Note (D) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding Southern Company's investments in two entities that
produce synthetic fuel and receive tax credits pursuant to Section 29 of the
IRC. The IRS is currently auditing both of these entities.
From the date of Southern Company's investments in these entities through
September 30, 2003, Southern Company has recognized approximately $250 million
of these synthetic fuel tax credits through income. The ultimate outcome of the
IRS audits cannot be determined at this time.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Reference is made to Note (M) to the Condensed Financial Statements for
information regarding FERC approval of the Open Access Transmission Tariff. This
settlement is not expected to have a material effect on Southern Company's
future earnings.

     Reference is made to Note (N) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding the termination of PPAs between Dynegy and Mississippi
Power and Southern Power. As result of the terminations of these PPAs, Southern
Power has deferred the completion date of Plant Franklin Unit 3 and is
completing limited construction activities to preserve the long-term viability
of the project. Current projections indicate completion in the 2008-2011 period.
The length of the deferral period will depend on forecasted capacity needs and
other wholesale market opportunities. Mississippi Power and Southern Power are
also continuing to explore alternatives for their existing capacity. The final
outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

     Reference is made to the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for discussion of various contingencies and other matters which may affect
future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Southern Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
the financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.
Southern Company's critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. The
operating companies are subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,
"Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a
portion of a company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, the
company would be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities
that are not specifically recoverable and determine if any other assets,
including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Southern Company
accrued for the ultimate costs of retiring most long-lived assets over the life
of the related asset through depreciation expense.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     FASB Statement No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which further amends and clarifies the
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments became effective generally
for financial instruments entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. Current
interpretations of Statement No. 149 indicate that certain electricity forward
transactions subject to unplanned netting (including those typically referred to
as "book outs") may not continue to qualify as cash flow hedges. This conclusion
is subject to ongoing discussions with the FASB and may change. Southern
Company's forward electricity contracts continue to qualify for the normal sales
exception and are recorded on an accrual basis. The implementation of Statement
No. 149 did not have a material effect on Southern Company's financial
statements.

     In July 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-11, which
addresses the reporting of realized gains and losses on derivative instruments
that became effective on October 1, 2003, and is currently being interpreted to
require book outs to be recorded on a net basis in operating revenues. Adoption
of this standard will not have a material impact on Southern Company's financial
statements as it affects only the classification of amounts in the Statements of
Income.

     In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,"
which requires classification of certain financial instruments within its scope,
including shares that are mandatorily redeemable, as liabilities. Statement No.
150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003 and otherwise on July 1, 2003. In accordance with Statement No. 150,
Southern Company and the operating companies reclassified $2.2 billion of
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities as liabilities effective July 1,
2003. The implementation of Statement No. 150 did not have any impact on
Southern Company's Statements of Income and Cash Flows.

     FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"
requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate
the related assets and liabilities. On July 1, 2003, Southern Company adopted
Interpretation No. 46 with no financial statement impact following completion of
restructuring Mississippi Power's lease arrangement for the combined cycle
generating units at Plant Daniel. See Financial Condition - "Off-Balance Sheet
Financing Arrangements" below and Note (S) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for further information on the lease restructuring. On October 9, 2003,
the FASB issued Staff Position No. FIN 46-6, which deferred the effective date
of Interpretation No. 46 until December 31, 2003 for interests held in variable
interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before
February 1, 2003. Current analysis indicates that the trusts established by
Southern Company and the operating companies to issue trust preferred securities
are variable interest entities under Interpretation No. 46 and, further, that
Southern Company and the operating companies are not the primary beneficiaries
of these trusts. If this conclusion is finalized, effective December 31, 2003,
the trust assets and liabilities, including the preferred securities issued by
the trusts, will be deconsolidated, the investments in the trusts will be
reflected under the equity method, and the loans from the trusts to Southern
Company and the operating companies will be reflected as long-term notes payable
to affiliates on the balance sheet. Based on the September 30, 2003 values, such
treatment would result in an increase of approximately $70 million to both total
assets and total liabilities. These reclassifications would not have any impact
on net income or cash flow.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Major changes in Southern Company's financial condition during the first nine
months of 2003 included $1.4 billion used for gross property additions to
utility plant. The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were
primarily obtained from operating activities and net security issuances of
approximately $300 million. See Southern Company's Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows herein for further details.

Ongoing Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements for Construction," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" of Southern Company in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern
Company system's capital requirements for its construction program, sinking fund
requirements, maturing debt and environmental compliance efforts. Approximately
$1.2 billion will be required by September 30, 2004 for redemptions and
maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, Southern Company
may require additional equity capital over the next several years. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised will be contingent on
Southern Company's investment opportunities. The operating companies and
Southern Power plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily
from operations and the issuances of new debt securities, term loans and
short-term borrowings. However, the amount, type and timing of any
financings, if needed, will depend upon market conditions and regulatory
approval. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" of Southern Company in
the Form 10-K for additional information.

     Southern Company's current liabilities exceed current assets because of the
continued use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs, as well
as scheduled maturities of long-term debt. To meet short-term cash needs and
contingencies, the Southern Company system had at September 30, 2003
approximately $583 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $3.4
billion of unused credit arrangements with banks, of which $32 million expire in
2003, $2.72 billion expire in 2004 and $665 million expire in 2005 and beyond.
Of the facilities maturing in 2003 and 2004, $2.24 billion contain provisions
allowing two-year term loans executable at the expiration date. These unused
credit arrangements also provide liquidity support to variable rate pollution
control bonds and commercial paper programs. The operating companies may also
meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request
and for the benefit of each of the operating companies. At September 30, 2003,
the Southern Company system had no outstanding extendible commercial notes and
outstanding notes payable of $460 million. Management believes that the need for
working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In May 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of an operating
lease agreement with Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership ("Escatawpa"), a
special purpose entity, to use a combined-cycle generating facility located at
Mississippi Power's Plant Daniel. The facility cost approximately $370 million.
Reference is made to Note 9 to the financial statements of Southern Company in
Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. In June 2003, Escatawpa sold
its ownership interests in the facility to Juniper Capital ("Juniper").
Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease agreement with
Mississippi Power. The terms of the lease with Juniper are substantially the
same as the lease with Escatawpa. In accordance with Interpretation No. 46,
Mississippi Power is not required to consolidate the leased assets and related
liabilities. Furthermore, the restructured lease agreement is an operating lease
under FASB Statement No. 13, "Accounting for Leases." Reference is made to Note
(S) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information.

Credit Rating Risk

Southern Company and its subsidiaries do not have any credit agreements that
would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result
of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts that could require
collateral -- but not accelerated payment -- in the event of a credit rating
change to below investment grade. These contracts are primarily for physical
electricity purchases and sales, fixed-price physical gas purchases and
agreements covering interest rate swaps. At September 30, 2003, the maximum
potential collateral requirements under the electricity purchase and sale
contracts and financial instrument agreements were approximately $387 million.
Generally, collateral may be provided for by a Southern Company guaranty, letter
of credit or cash. At September 30, 2003, there were no material collateral
requirements for the gas purchase contracts.

Exposure to Market Risks

Southern Company's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have
not changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Southern Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, the operating companies have limited
exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and
prices of electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in
electricity prices, the operating companies and Southern Power enter into fixed
price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market and, to a lesser extent, similar contracts for gas purchases.
Also, the operating companies have each implemented fuel-hedging programs at the
instruction of their respective PSCs. The fair value of derivative energy
contracts at September 30, 2003 was as follows:

cost recovery clauses. In addition, unrealized gains and losses on electric and
gas contracts used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales are deferred in
Other Comprehensive Income. Gains and losses on contracts that do not represent
hedges are recognized in the Statements of Income as incurred. At September 30,

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Southern Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of
nonperformance by the parties to the derivative energy contracts. Southern
Company's policy is to enter into agreements with counterparties that have
investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P or that provide adequate
collateral; therefore, Southern Company does not anticipate nonperformance by
the counterparties. For additional information, reference is made to Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Market Price Risk" of Southern Company
in the Form 10-K, Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company in Item
8 of the Form 10-K and Note (L) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein.

Financing Activities

During the first nine months of 2003, Southern Company subsidiaries issued $2.8
billion of senior notes, $125 million of preferred stock and $75 million of
other long-term debt. The issuances were primarily used to refund long-term
senior notes and other long-term debt. The remainder was used to reduce
short-term debt and fund ongoing construction programs. Reference is made to
Southern Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows herein for
further details on financing activities during the first nine months of 2003.

     In July 2003, Alabama Power entered into swaps to hedge interest payments
associated with an anticipated debt issuance planned in December 2003. The swaps
are for a notional amount of $350 million at a fixed interest rate of 2.35% and
mature in December 2006.

     In July 2003, Georgia Power entered into swaps to hedge interest payments
associated with variable rate pollution control bonds. The swaps are for a
notional amount of $873.3 million at an average fixed interest rate of 1.388%
and mature in December 2004. Also in July 2003, Georgia Power entered into a
swap to hedge interest payments associated with a variable rate note with a
coupon of LIBOR plus 10 basis points. The swap is for a notional amount of $50
million at a fixed interest rate of 1.5625% and matures in January 2005.

     In July 2003, Gulf Power issued $60 million of Series G 4.35% Senior Notes
due July 15, 2013 and $60 million of Series H 5.25% Senior Notes due July 15,
2033. The proceeds of the Series G Senior Notes were used to pay at maturity the
$60 million outstanding principal amount of Series C 4.69% Senior Notes due
August 1, 2003. The proceeds of the Series H Senior Notes were used to redeem in
August 2003 the $46.7 million outstanding principal amount of the Series A 6.70%
Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due June 30, 2038. The remainder was used to
repay a portion of Gulf Power's short-term indebtedness.

     In September 2003, Georgia Power issued $100 million of Series Q 4.90%
Senior Notes due September 15, 2013. The proceeds from this sale were used to
repay a portion of Georgia Power's outstanding commercial paper. In connection
with this sale, Georgia Power settled a related treasury lock and incurred a
loss of $2.5 million.

     In September 2003, Gulf Power issued $40 million of Series I 5.75% Senior
Notes due September 15, 2033. The proceeds from this issue were used in October
2003 to redeem the $45 million outstanding principal amount of Gulf Power
Capital Trust II 7.00% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities.

     In October 2003, Georgia Power issued $200 million of Series R 6% Senior
Notes due October 15, 2033. The proceeds from this sale will be used to redeem
in November 2003 all of the Series B 6.6% Senior Notes due December 31, 2038.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In July 2003, Savannah Electric entered into a swap to hedge interest
payments associated with an anticipated debt issuance planned in December 2003.
The swap is for a notional amount of $25 million at a fixed interest rate of
5.025% and matures in December 2013. In addition, Savannah Electric entered
into a swap to hedge payments associated with a variable rate bank note. The
swap is for a notional amount of $20 million at a fixed interest rate of 2.06%
and matures in December 2004.

     In August 2003, Southern Company entered into an interest rate swap to
hedge the fair value of a $40 million senior note outstanding at SCS.

     Also, Southern Company and its subsidiaries plan to continue, to the extent
possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

     The market price of Southern Company's common stock at September 30, 2003
was $29.35 per share and the book value was $13.24 per share, representing a
market-to-book ratio of 222%, compared to $28.39, $12.16 and 233%, respectively,
at the end of 2002. The dividend for the third quarter 2003 was $0.35 per share
compared to $0.3425 per share in the third quarter 2002.

PART I

Item 3.       Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Exposure to Market
Risks" herein for each registrant and Note 1 to the financial statements of each
registrant in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Reference is also made to Note (L) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for information relating to derivative
instruments.

Item 4.       Controls and Procedures.

(a)      Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, Southern Company,
the operating companies and Southern Power conducted separate evaluations under
the supervision and with the participation of each company's management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Sections
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon
those evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,
in each case, concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material information relating
to each company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be
included in periodic filings with the SEC.

(b)      Changes in internal controls.

There have been no significant changes in Southern Company's, the operating
companies' or Southern Power's internal controls over financial reporting (as
such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) during the third quarter of 2003 that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Southern Company's, the
operating companies' or Southern Power's internal controls over financial
reporting.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Alabama Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third
quarter and year-to-date 2003 was $216.5 million and $415 million, respectively,
compared to $200.7 million and $388.9 million, respectively, for the
corresponding periods of 2002. Earnings increased by $15.8 million, or 7.9%, in
the third quarter 2003 and by $26.1 million, or 6.7%, year-to-date 2003 due
primarily to higher sales for resale, increases in other revenues and lower
interest expense, partially offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses.

     Retail sales. Excluding energy cost recovery revenues and revenues
associated with PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, which generally do not
affect net income, retail sales revenues decreased by $10.7 million, or 1.6%,
for the third quarter 2003, but increased $2.2 million, or 0.1%, year-to-date
2003, when compared to the corresponding periods in 2002. Reference is made to
Note (F) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information
regarding these PPAs. Retail kilowatt-hour energy sales decreased 1.3% in the
third quarter 2003 and remained stable for the year when compared to the same
periods in 2002. Milder-than-normal temperatures caused the decrease in
kilowatt-hour energy sales in the third quarter of 2003.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. During the third quarter 2003, the
revenues associated with sales for resale to non-affiliates decreased due to a
7.4% decrease in market based prices even though overall kilowatt-hour sales of
energy for the quarter increased 1.2% when compared to the corresponding period
in 2002. The year-to-date increase in sales for resale to non-affiliates in 2003
is due to a 5.2% increase in kilowatt-hour energy sold when compared to the
corresponding period in 2002. Kilowatt-hour sales of energy will vary depending
on demand, market based prices and the availability of Southern Company system
generation.

                              ALABAMA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Sales for
resale to affiliates increased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2003
primarily due to the combination of increased demand by Southern Power to meet
contractual obligations and the availability of power due to milder-than-normal
weather in Alabama Power's service territory. In addition, sales for resale
revenues increased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2003 over the same
periods in 2002 due to increased capacity payments received in accordance with
the affiliated company interchange agreement as a result of increased capacity
from PPAs. Purchases of energy will vary depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. Purchased power
from affiliates increased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2003 principally
due to a PPA between Alabama Power and Southern Power that began in June 2003.
The capacity component of these transactions was $25.9 million in the third
quarter 2003 and $33.9 million year-to-date 2003. Excluding the capacity
revenue, these transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings since
the related energy is sold at marginal cost, and energy purchases are generally
offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.

     Other revenues. During the third quarter 2003, other revenues increased
largely due to a $4.7 million increase in revenues from cogeneration steam
facilities due primarily to higher gas prices and a $4.3 million increase in
revenues from Alabama PSC approved fees charged to customers for connection,
reconnection and collection when compared to the same period in 2002. The
year-to-date 2003 increase is primarily due to a $16.4 million increase in
revenues from cogeneration steam facilities and an $11.6 million increase in
revenues from fees charged to customers when compared to the same period in
2002. Since cogeneration steam revenues are generally offset by fuel expenses,
these revenues do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. Fuel expense was higher in the third quarter 2003 when
compared to the corresponding period in 2002 mainly due to a 52% increase in gas
prices and a 4.6% increase in coal prices. The year-to-date 2003 increase is
primarily due to a 61.2% increase in gas prices and a 2.8% increase in coal
prices when compared to the same period in 2002. Generation for both third
quarter and year-to-date 2003 remained relatively constant when compared to the
same period in 2002. Since energy expenses are generally offset by energy
revenues, these expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. The decrease in purchased
power-non-affiliates in the third quarter 2003 is due to an 11.6% decrease in
energy purchased and a 5.4% decrease in price. The decrease in energy purchased
from non-affiliates is a result of the mild summer weather that lowered overall
demand in Alabama Power's retail service territory, in addition to the effect of
a new PPA with Southern Power that began in June 2003. The year-to-date 2003
increase is due to a 26.5% increase in price even though energy purchased
decreased 7.0% when compared to the corresponding period in 2002. These expenses
do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally
offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.

     Other operation expense. The increase in other operation expense in the
third quarter 2003 is mainly a result of a $3.9 million increase in
administrative and general expenses. This increase primarily relates to a $4.7
million increase in accrued expense for liability insurance, litigation, and
workers compensation offset by a $2.4 million decrease in employee benefits. The
year-to-date 2003 increase in other operation expense when compared to the same
period in 2002 is primarily due to a $24.2 million increase in administrative
and general expenses, a $2.8 million increase in steam expense and a $2.8
million increase in customer account expenses. The increase in administrative
and general expenses is primarily due to a $7.9 million increase in property
insurance, a $6.9 million increase in accrued expense for liability insurance,
litigation, and workers compensation and a $4.8 million increase in employee
benefits.

     Maintenance expense. The increase in maintenance expense for the third
quarter 2003 is attributed to a $4.3 million increase in transmission expense
and a $2.8 million increase in distribution expense. The year-to-date 2003
increase when compared to the corresponding period in 2002 is primarily due to a
$4.2 million dollar increase in transmission expense and a $3.7 million increase
in distribution expense. The increase in transmission and distribution expense
for the third quarter and year-to-date 2003 is mainly related to work performed
on overhead and underground lines.

     Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. The decreases in interest
expense, net of amounts capitalized, during the third quarter and year-to-date
2003 when compared to the same periods in 2002 are a result of refinancing
higher cost debt.

     Distributions on shares subject to mandatory redemption. Refinancing of
trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter 2002 led to decreases in this
item in the third quarter and year-to-date 2003.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including Alabama Power's ability to achieve energy sales growth while
containing costs and maintaining a stable regulatory environment. Growth in
energy sales is subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather,
competition, new short- and long-term contracts with neighboring utilities,
energy conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand and the
rate of economic growth in Alabama Power's service area. For additional
information relating to these issues, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - The SOUTHERN
System - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of Alabama Power in the Form 10-K.

     Alabama Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. In addition, Alabama Power's business activities
are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and
the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various
types, including property damage, personal injury and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout the United
States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged
exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome
of such litigation against Alabama Power cannot be predicted at this time;
however, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising
from such current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on Alabama
Power's financial statements.

     Comprehensive energy legislation has been passed by both the U.S. House of
Representatives and the Senate. Significant differences exist in the legislation
and a joint conference is underway to formulate a compromise final bill. While
the form of this final bill is not yet known, it is expected to address a number
of issues related to the electric utility industry and could affect the business
operations and financial condition of Alabama Power.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For
additional information about these issues, including the EPA litigation, see
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note
3 to the financial statements of Alabama Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and
Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein. On October 27, 2003, the
EPA published a final rule providing that certain equipment

replacements be excluded from New Source Review and Prevention of Significant
Deterioration provisions of the Clean Air Act under the definition of "routine
maintenance, repair and replacement." This final rule must be adopted by the
State of Alabama in order to apply to Alabama Power's facilities. If fully
implemented, this final regulation could affect the applicability of these
regulations to activities at Alabama Power's facilities. The final outcome of
these matters cannot now be determined.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Alabama Power in the Form 10-K for
information on the formation of an RTO and the notice of proposed rulemaking
regarding open access transmission service and standard electricity market
design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related to its proposed
rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard electricity
market design in an effort to respond to certain of the public comments received
on the proposal. Reactions to the White Paper by certain Southeastern state
regulators reflect significant continuing differences in opinion between the
FERC and those state regulatory commissions over questions of jurisdiction and
protection of retail customers. These significant differences between state and
federal regulators create substantial uncertainty related to the ultimate
approval of SeTrans because state commission approval of the transfer of
operational control of the transmission assets of Southern Company and its
subsidiaries is a prerequisite to the formation of SeTrans. Pending energy
legislation may also impact these issues. Any impact of the FERC proposals
on Alabama Power will depend on the form in which final rules may be ultimately
adopted; however, Alabama Power's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities
could be adversely affected by changes in the transmission regulatory structure
in its regional power market.

     Reference is made to Note (M) to the Condensed Financial Statements for
information regarding FERC approval of the Open Access Transmission Tariff. This
settlement is not expected to have a material effect on Alabama Power's future
earnings.

     In July 2003, the Alabama PSC issued an order affirming the past treatment
of amortizing severance expenses over 22 months and provided that future
severance expense be recognized as incurred. Such treatment is in accordance
with FASB No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities," and is not expected to have a material impact on Alabama Power's
future earnings.

     On September 9, 2003, the voters of Alabama rejected a tax reform package
in a state-wide referendum. Currently, no additional revenue increasing
legislation has been proposed.

     Reference is also made to the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for discussion of various contingencies and other matters which may
affect future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Alabama Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of Alabama Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Alabama
Power's critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. Alabama Power is
subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a portion of Alabama Power's
operations is no longer subject to these provisions, Alabama Power would be
required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
specifically recoverable and determine if any other assets, including plant,
have been impaired.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Alabama Power accrued
for the ultimate costs of retiring most long-lived assets over the life of the
related asset through depreciation expense.

     FASB Statement No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which further amends and clarifies the
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments became effective generally
for financial instruments entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. Current
interpretations of Statement No. 149 indicate that certain electricity forward
transactions subject to unplanned netting (including those typically referred to
as "book outs") may not continue to qualify as cash flow hedges.
This conclusion is subject to ongoing discussions with the FASB and may change.
Alabama Power's forward electricity contracts continue to qualify for the normal
sales exception and are recorded on an accrual basis. The implementation of
Statement No. 149 did not have a material effect on Alabama Power's financial
statements.

     In July 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-11, which
addresses the reporting of realized gains and losses on derivative instruments
that became effective on October 1, 2003, and is currently being interpreted to
require book outs to be recorded on a net basis in operating revenues. Adoption
of this standard will not have a material impact on Alabama Power's financial
statements as it affects only the classification of amounts in the Statements of
Income.

     In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,"
which requires classification of certain financial instruments within its scope,
including shares that are mandatorily redeemable, as liabilities. Statement No.
150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003 and otherwise on July 1, 2003. In accordance with Statement No. 150,
Alabama Power reclassified $300 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities as liabilities effective July 1, 2003. The implementation of
Statement No. 150 did not have any impact on Alabama Power's Statements of
Income and Cash Flows.

     FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"
requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate
the related assets and liabilities. On October 9, 2003, the FASB issued Staff
Position No. FIN 46-6, which deferred the effective date of Interpretation No.
46 until December 31, 2003 for interests held in variable interest entities or
potential variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003. Current
analysis indicates that the trusts established by Alabama Power to issue trust
preferred securities are variable interest entities under Interpretation No. 46
and, further, that Alabama Power is not the primary beneficiary of these trusts.
If this conclusion is finalized, effective December 31, 2003, the


                                       35

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


trust assets and liabilities, including the preferred securities issued by the
trusts, will be deconsolidated, the investments in the trusts will be reflected
under the equity method, and the loans from the trusts to Alabama Power will be
reflected as long-term notes payable to affiliates on the accompanying balance
sheet. Based on the September 30, 2003 values, such treatment would result in an
increase of approximately $9.3 million to both total assets and total
liabilities. These reclassifications would not have any impact on net income or
cash flow.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in Alabama Power's financial condition during the first nine
months of 2003 included the addition of approximately $473 million to utility
plant. The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operating activities and net security issuances of $178 million.
See Alabama Power's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows herein for further
details.

Ongoing Capital Requirements

Reference  is made to Item 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  of
Alabama Power under  "Capital  Requirements  for  Construction,"  "Other Capital
Requirements" and "Environmental  Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of
Alabama Power's capital requirements for its construction program, maturing debt
and environmental compliance efforts.  Approximately $1 billion will be required
by September 30, 2004 for redemptions and maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the  financing  activities  described  below,  Alabama Power
plans to obtain the funds  required for  construction  and other  purposes  from
sources  similar to those used in the past.  The amount,  type and timing of any
financings -- if needed -- will depend upon  maintenance  of adequate  earnings,
regulatory approval,  prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     Alabama Power's current liabilities exceed current assets because of
scheduled maturities of long-term debt.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Alabama Power had at
September 30, 2003 approximately $213 million of cash and cash equivalents,
unused committed lines of credit of approximately $815 million (including $454
million of such lines which are dedicated to funding purchase obligations
relating to variable rate pollution control bonds) and an extendible commercial
note program. These lines of credit unless extended, will expire at various

                                       36

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


times during 2004.  Alabama Power may also meet  short-term cash needs through a
Southern  Company  subsidiary  organized to issue and sell commercial  paper and
extendible  commercial notes at the request and for the benefit of Alabama Power
and other Southern Company subsidiaries.  Alabama Power has regulatory authority
for up to $1 billion of short-term  borrowings.  At September 30, 2003,  Alabama
Power had no commercial paper or notes payable to banks outstanding.  Management
believes that the need for working  capital can be  adequately  met by utilizing
lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

Credit Rating Risk

Alabama Power does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

Alabama Power's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Alabama Power is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, Alabama Power has limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Alabama Power enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and
sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser
extent, similar contracts for gas purchases. Alabama Power has also implemented
a retail fuel hedging program at the instruction of the Alabama PSC. The fair
value of derivative energy contracts at September 30, 2003 was as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to the retail fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets

fuel expense and are recovered through Alabama Power's fuel cost recovery
clause. Gains and losses on contracts that do not represent hedges are

fair value of derivative energy contracts reflected in the financial statements

     For the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, approximately $2
million and $0.3 million, respectively, of gains were recognized in income. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, approximately $1.7 million
and $(2) million, respectively, of gains (losses) were recognized in income.

Financing Activities

Alabama Power issued a total of $1,065 million of Senior Notes in the first nine
months of 2003. The proceeds of these issues were used to redeem $807 million of
Senior Notes and for other general corporate purposes. In addition, Alabama
Power redeemed $194 million of Senior Notes in the first quarter 2003 from
proceeds obtained from a December 2002 issuance of $200 million of Senior Notes.

     Also in the first quarter 2003, Alabama Power issued 1,250 shares ($125
million) of Preferred Stock. The proceeds of this issue were used to repay a
portion of Alabama Power's outstanding short-term indebtedness and for other
general corporate purposes.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In the second quarter 2003, Alabama Power issued a total of 625,000 shares
of common stock to Southern Company at $40.00 a share ($25,000,000 aggregate
purchase price). The proceeds from the sale were used by Alabama Power for
general corporate purposes.

     Also, in the second quarter 2003, Alabama Power entered into swaps to hedge
interest payments associated with variable rate pollution control bonds. The
swaps are for a notional amount of $486 million at an average fixed rate of
1.99% effective January 2004 and mature in January 2007. Further in the second
quarter 2003, Alabama Power entered into a swap to hedge interest payments
associated with variable rate notes. The swap is for a notional amount of $195
million at a fixed interest rate of 1.89% and matures in April 2006.

     In July 2003, Alabama Power entered into swaps to hedge interest payments
associated with an anticipated debt issuance planned in December 2003. The swaps
are for a notional amount of $350 million at a fixed interest rate of 2.35% and
mature in December 2006.

     Alabama Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to
retire higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Georgia Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the
third quarter and year-to-date 2003 was $264.9 million and $556.7 million,
respectively, compared to $271.6 million and $569.1 million for the
corresponding periods in 2002. Earnings in the third quarter 2003 were $6.6
million, or 2.4%, lower when compared to the same period in 2002 primarily due
to lower retail base revenues. Year-to-date 2003 earnings decreased by $12.4
million, or 2.2%, when compared to the corresponding period in 2002. The
year-to-date 2003 decrease is mainly attributed to lower retail base revenues
and higher non-fuel operating expenses.

N/M  Not meaningful

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue decreased by $32.4 million, or 3.3%, in the third
quarter 2003 and $39.7 million, or 1.6%, year-to-date 2003 when compared to the
same periods in 2002. In the third quarter and year-to-date 2003, kilowatt-hour
energy sales to retail customers decreased by 1.5% and 0.6%, respectively. A
relatively mild summer and the sluggish economy were the main factors affecting
the demand for energy which more than offset increases in the number of
customers served by Georgia Power of 0.5% and 1.6% in the third quarter and
year-to-date 2003, respectively.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. The third quarter and year-to-date 2003
decreases in these sales to non-affiliates are attributed to fluctuations in
off-system sales transactions that were generally offset by corresponding
purchase transactions. These transactions did not have a significant impact on
earnings since the energy is usually sold at variable cost.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - affiliates. Sales for resale to affiliates increased in
the third quarter and year-to-date 2003 primarily due to the combination of
increased demand by Southern Power to meet contractual obligations and the
availability of power due to milder-than-normal weather in Georgia Power's
service territory. During the third quarter and year-to-date 2003, energy sales
to affiliates increased 4.2% and 62.2%, respectively, when compared to the same
periods in the prior year. These transactions did not have a significant impact
on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

     Fuel expense. Fuel expense was higher in the third quarter and year-to-date
2003 mainly due to increased generation and higher unit cost of fuel when
compared to the corresponding periods in 2002. These expenses do not have a
significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by
energy revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery clause.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. During the third quarter and year-to-date
2003, purchased power from non-affiliates decreased primarily due to a decrease
in off-system purchases to meet lower off-system sales commitments. These
expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are
generally offset by energy revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery
clause.

     Purchased power - affiliates. Purchased power from affiliates increased
in the third quarter and year-to-date 2003 principally due to PPAs between
Georgia Power and Southern Power that began in June 2002 and June 2003. The
capacity component of these transactions remained constant in the third quarter
2003 and increased $33.5 million year-to-date 2003 when compared to the
corresponding periods in 2002. The energy component of power purchased from
affiliated companies within the Southern Company system will vary depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company and
will have no significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally
offset by energy revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery clause.

     Other operation expense. The third quarter and year-to-date 2003 decreases
are primarily attributed to lower administrative and general expenses in these
periods compared to the same periods in 2002 due to decreased employee
compensation in 2003.

     Maintenance expense. These expenses were lower in the third quarter and
year-to-date 2003 due mainly to lower power production maintenance expense when
compared to the corresponding periods in 2002 as a result of efforts to control
costs.

     Depreciation and amortization. In the third quarter and year-to-date 2003,
depreciation and amortization expense decreased when compared to the same
periods in 2002. These decreases are a result of lower regulatory charges
necessary to levelize purchased power capacity costs under the terms of the
retail rate order effective January 1, 2002. These decreases are offset by an
increase in purchased power-affiliates costs discussed above. All purchased
power costs will be reflected in rates evenly from 2002 through 2004 under the
retail rate order effective January 1, 2002.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Taxes other than income taxes. During the third quarter and year-to-date
2003, taxes other than income taxes increased due mainly to a favorable true-up
of state property tax evaluations in 2002.

     Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. These increases in interest
expense, net of amounts capitalized for the third quarter and year-to-date 2003
are primarily related to an increase in senior notes outstanding from the same
periods in 2002, partially offset by a reduction in interest on short-term debt.

     Other income (expense), net. During the third quarter 2003, this item
reflects decreased revenues associated with a new electricity pricing program
when compared to the same period in the prior year. Year-to-date 2003, the
increase in income for this line item is attributed primarily to the new
electricity pricing program and $14.5 million in interest on a favorable income
tax settlement completed in the second quarter of 2003. The electricity pricing
program revenues decreased $5.8 million in the third quarter 2003 and increased
$4.4 million year-to-date 2003.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales. For additional information relating to these issues, see Item 1
- - BUSINESS - The SOUTHERN System - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of Georgia Power in the
Form 10-K.

     In January 2002, Georgia Power began operating under a three-year retail
rate order. Under the terms of the order, earnings will be evaluated annually
against a retail return on common equity range of 10 percent to 12.95 percent.
Two-thirds of any earnings above the 12.95 percent return will be applied to
rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. Retail
rates were decreased by $118 million effective January 1, 2002. Purchases under
PPAs will be reflected in rates evenly over the next three years under the
retail rate order effective January 1, 2002. Reference is made to Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" and Note 3 to
the financial statements of Georgia Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for
additional information.

     On August 19, 2003, the Georgia PSC issued an order approving a stipulation
reached by Georgia Power, the Consumers' Utility Counsel Division, Georgia
Textile Manufacturers Association, Georgia Industrial Group and the Staff of the
Georgia PSC allowing Georgia Power to increase customer fuel rates to recover
existing under-recovered deferred fuel costs. Reference is made to Note (G) to
the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Georgia Power in the Form 10-K for
information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice of
proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Reactions to
the White Paper by Southeastern state regulators reflect significant continuing
differences in opinion between the FERC and various state regulatory commissions
over questions of jurisdiction and protection of retail customers. These

significant differences between state and federal regulators create substantial
uncertainty related to the ultimate approval of SeTrans because state commission
approval of the transfer of operational control of the transmission assets of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries is a prerequisite to the formation of
SeTrans. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any impact of
the FERC proposals on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on the
form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Georgia Power's
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities could be adversely affected by
changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its regional power market.

     Reference is made to Note (M) to the Condensed Financial Statements for
information regarding FERC approval of the Open Access Transmission Tariff. This
settlement is not expected to have a material effect on Georgia Power's future
earnings.

     In June 2002, Georgia Power entered into a fifteen-year PPA beginning in
June 2005 with Southern Power to purchase 1,040 megawatts of capacity from the
planned combined-cycle plant at Plant McIntosh to be built and owned by Southern
Power. The annual capacity cost is expected to be approximately $72 million.
Reference is made to Note (Q) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the FERC approval process for this PPA.

     Additionally, Georgia Power has entered into a seven-year PPA beginning in
June 2005 with Duke Energy Trading & Marketing to purchase 620 megawatts with an
average annual capacity cost of approximately $48 million. Reference is made to
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" and
Note 4 under "Purchased Power Commitments" to the financial statements of
Georgia Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

     Comprehensive energy legislation has been passed by both the U.S. House of
Representatives and the Senate. Significant differences exist in the legislation
and a joint conference is underway to formulate a compromise final bill. While
the form of this final bill is not yet known, it is expected to address a number
of issues related to the electric utility industry and could affect the business
operations and financial condition of Georgia Power.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For
additional information, including information on the EPA litigation, see Item 7
- - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" of Georgia
Power and Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power in Item 8 of the
Form 10-K and Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein. On October
27, 2003, the EPA published a final rule providing that certain equipment
replacements be excluded from New Source Review and Prevention of Significant
Deterioration provisions of the Clean Air Act under the definition of "routine
maintenance, repair and replacement." This final rule must be adopted by the
State of Georgia in order to apply to Georgia Power's facilities. If fully
implemented, this final regulation could affect the applicability of these
regulations to activities at Georgia Power's facilities. The final outcome of
these matters cannot now be determined.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of Georgia Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. On September 26, 2003, the
EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register, formally reclassifying the
Atlanta area as a "severe" nonattainment area for the one-hour ozone standard
under Title I of the Clean Air Act, effective January 1, 2004. If the Atlanta
area fails to comply with the one-hour standard by November 2005, all major
sources of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds located in the
nonattainment area, including Georgia Power's Plants McDonough and Yates, could
be subject to payment of emissions fees for nitrogen oxides emitted above 80% of
the baseline period. The baseline period is currently unknown. Based on average
emissions at these units over the past three years, such fees could potentially
reach $23 million annually. However, Georgia Power does not anticipate exceeding
80% of the baseline and, therefore, does not anticipate incurring any such fees.
The final outcome of this matter will depend on the development and
implementation of applicable regulations.

     Georgia Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. In addition, Georgia Power's business activities
are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and
the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various
types, including property damage, personal injury and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout the United
States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged
exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome
of such litigation against Georgia Power cannot be predicted at this time;
however, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising
from such current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on Georgia
Power's financial statements.

     Reference is made to the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for discussion of various contingencies and other matters which may affect
future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Georgia Power's significant  accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
the financial  statements  of Georgia Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.  Georgia
Power's critical  accounting  policy involves rate regulation.  Georgia Power is
subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,  "Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of  Regulation." In the event that a portion of Georgia Power's
operations  is no longer  subject to these  provisions,  Georgia  Power would be
required to write off related  regulatory  assets and  liabilities  that are not
specifically  recoverable  and determine if any other assets,  including  plant,
have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No.
143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003.
Statement No. 143 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived assets.
The present value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be
recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs must be
capitalized as

                                       50

<PAGE>


                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Georgia Power accrued
for the ultimate costs of retiring most long-lived assets over the life of the
related asset through depreciation expense.

     FASB Statement No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which further amends and clarifies the
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments became effective generally
for financial instruments entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. Current
interpretations of Statement No. 149 indicate that certain electricity forward
transactions subject to unplanned netting (including those typically referred to
as "book outs") may not continue to qualify as cash flow hedges. This conclusion
is subject to ongoing discussions with the FASB and may change. Georgia Power's
forward electricity contracts continue to qualify for the normal sales exception
and are recorded on an accrual basis.  The implementation of Statement No. 149
did not have a material effect on Georgia Power's financial statements.

     In July 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-11, which
addresses the reporting of realized gains and losses on derivative instruments
that became effective on October 1, 2003, and is currently being interpreted to
require book outs to be recorded on a net basis in operating revenues. Adoption
of this standard will not have a material impact on Georgia Power's financial
statements as it affects only the classification of amounts in the Statements of
Income.

     In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,"
which requires classification of certain financial instruments within its scope,
including shares that are mandatorily redeemable, as liabilities. Statement No.
150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003 and otherwise on July 1, 2003. In accordance with Statement No. 150,
Georgia Power reclassified $940 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities as liabilities effective July 1, 2003. The implementation of
Statement No. 150 did not have any impact on Georgia Power's Statements of
Income and Cash Flows.

     FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"
requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate
the related assets and liabilities. On October 9, 2003, the FASB issued Staff
Position No. FIN 46-6, which deferred the effective date of Interpretation No.
46 until December 31, 2003 for interests held in variable interest entities or
potential variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003. Current
analysis indicates that the trusts established by Georgia Power to issue trust
preferred securities are variable interest entities under Interpretation No. 46
and, further, that Georgia Power is not the primary beneficiary of these trusts.
If this conclusion is finalized, effective December 31, 2003, the trust assets
and liabilities, including the preferred securities issued by the trusts, will
be deconsolidated, the investments in the trusts will be reflected under the
equity method, and the loans from the trusts to Georgia Power will be reflected
as long-term notes payable to affiliates on the balance sheet. Based on the
September 30, 2003 values, such treatment would result in an increase of
approximately $29 million to both total assets and total liabilities. These
reclassifications would not have any impact on net income or cash flow.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The major change in Georgia Power's financial condition during the first nine
months of 2003 was the addition of approximately $537 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See Georgia Power's Condensed Statements of Cash
Flows herein for further details.

Ongoing Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of Georgia
Power under "Financing Activities," "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of Georgia Power's
capital requirements for its construction program, maturing debt and
environmental compliance efforts. Approximately $2.3 million will be required by
September 30, 2004 for redemptions and maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

Georgia Power plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, including funds from
operations and new security issuances. The amount, type and timing of additional
security issuances -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     Georgia Power's current liabilities frequently exceed current assets
because of the continued use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash
needs, which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business.
To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Georgia Power had at September
30, 2003 approximately $14.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $725 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. These
credit arrangements expire in June 2004 and contain provisions allowing two-year
term loans executable at the expiration. The credit arrangements provide
liquidity support to Georgia Power's obligations with respect to variable rate
pollution control bonds and commercial paper. Georgia Power may also meet
short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue
and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for
the benefit of Georgia Power and other Southern Company subsidiaries. At
September 30, 2003, Georgia Power had outstanding $70 million of commercial
paper. Management believes that the need for working capital can be adequately
met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

Credit Rating Risk

Georgia Power does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade. There are certain physical electricity sales contracts that could
require collateral -- but not termination -- in the event of a credit rating
change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided for by a
Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit or cash. At September 30, 2003, the
maximum potential collateral requirements were approximately $228 million.

Exposure to Market Risks

Georgia Power's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have
not changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period.
In addition, Georgia Power is not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, Georgia Power has limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Georgia Power enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and
sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser
extent, similar contracts for gas purchases. Georgia Power has also implemented
a retail fuel hedging program at the instruction of the Georgia PSC. The fair
value of derivative energy contracts at September 30, 2003 was as follows:

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Realized gains and losses are recognized in the Statements of Income as
incurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, approximately
$2.4 million and $0.3 million of gains, respectively, were recognized in income.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, approximately $2.1
million and $1.7 million of gains, respectively, were recognized in income.

     For additional information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Exposure to Market Risks" of Georgia Power in the
Form 10-K and Note 1 to the financial statements of Georgia Power in Item 8 of
the Form 10-K.

Financing Activities

In the first half of 2003, Georgia Power issued a total of $700 million of
Senior Notes. The proceeds of these issues were used to redeem
$465 million of Senior Notes and to repay a portion of Georgia Power's
short-term indebtedness. Further in the first half of 2003, Georgia Power
entered into a swap to hedge interest payments associated with a variable rate
note with a coupon of LIBOR plus 12.5 basis points. The swap is for a notional
amount of $250 million at a fixed interest rate of 1.960% and matures in
February 2005.

     During March 2003, Georgia Power elected to change the interest rate mode
on $316 million of variable rate pollution control bonds. Georgia Power changed
$255 million of the bonds from the "daily rate mode," which required backup bank
credit facilities, to the "auction rate mode." In addition, Georgia Power
changed $61 million of the bonds from the "daily rate mode" to the "long-term
interest rate mode."

     In July 2003, Georgia Power entered into swaps to hedge interest payments
associated with variable rate pollution control bonds. The swaps are for a
notional amount of $873.3 million at an average fixed interest rate of 1.388%
and mature in December 2004. Also in July 2003, Georgia Power entered into a
swap to hedge interest payments associated with a variable rate note with a
coupon of LIBOR plus 10 basis points. The swap is for a notional amount of $50
million at a fixed interest rate of 1.5625% and matures in January 2005.

     In September 2003, Georgia Power issued $100 million of Series Q 4.90%
Senior Notes due September 15, 2013. The proceeds from this sale were used to
repay a portion of Georgia Power's outstanding commercial paper. In connection
with this sale, Georgia Power settled a related treasury lock and incurred a
loss of $2.5 million.

     In October 2003, Georgia Power issued $200 million of Series R 6% Senior
Notes due October 15, 2033. The proceeds from this sale will be used to redeem
in November 2003 all of the Series B 6.6% Senior Notes due December 31, 2038.

     Georgia Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to
retire higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Gulf Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third quarter
and year-to-date 2003 was $32.8 million and $65.6 million, respectively,
compared to $34 million and $59.2 million for the corresponding periods in 2002.
Earnings for the third quarter 2003 decreased $1.2 million, or 3.5%, primarily
due to higher operating expenses which were partially offset by higher operating
revenues and lower interest expense. Earnings increased year-to-date 2003 by
$6.4 million, or 10.8%, mainly due to higher operating revenues when compared to
the same period in 2002 primarily as a result of the retail rate increase that
took effect in June 2002.

N/M  Not meaningful

     Retail sales. Excluding the recovery of fuel expense and certain other
expenses that do not affect net income, retail sales decreased by $2.3 million,
or 2%, for the third quarter 2003 and increased by $19 million, or 6.5%,
year-to-date 2003 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2002. Retail
sales revenue was higher year-to-date 2003 than in year-to-date 2002 primarily
due to the retail rate increase in June 2002 and an increase in the number of
customers. The decrease in retail sales revenue during the third quarter 2003 is
primarily due to mild weather.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. The third quarter and year-to-date 2003
decreases in sales for resale to non-affiliates are attributed to lower demand
for energy by these customers. These transactions did not have a significant
impact on earnings since the energy is sold at variable cost.

                               GULF POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies and purchases of energy within the
Southern Company system will vary depending on demand and the availability and
cost of generating resources at each company. Gulf Power increased its
generating resources with commercial operation of Plant Smith in April 2002 and
thus had greater generation resources to sell to affiliates. These transactions
do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold
at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues
through Gulf Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism.

     Other revenues. In the third quarter and year-to-date 2003, other revenues
were lower due to a $1.7 million settlement related to a PPA recorded in 2002,
partially offset by increases in miscellaneous service revenues.

     Fuel expense. Fuel expense during the third quarter and year-to-date 2003
was higher primarily due to increased generation to meet the demand for energy
and higher average cost of fuel. Since energy expenses are generally offset by
energy revenues through Gulf Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism, these
expenses do not have a material impact on net income.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. In the third quarter 2003, purchased
power from non-affiliates decreased primarily due to the availability of lower
cost alternatives within the Southern Company system when compared to the same
period in 2002. The decrease in year-to-date 2003 when compared to the
corresponding period in 2002 is directly related to commercial operation of
Plant Smith Unit 3.

     Other operation expense. The third quarter and year-to-date 2003 increases
are primarily due to higher cost associated with production, customer accounts
and administrative and general expenses when compared to the same periods in
2002. Customer accounts expense increased by $0.3 million and $1.6 million for
the third quarter and year-to-date 2003, respectively. Administrative and
general expenses increased by $0.3 million and $2.5 million in the third quarter
and year-to-date 2003, respectively, mainly due to relocation expenses and
insurance expenses.

     Maintenance expense. In the third quarter and year-to-date 2003,
maintenance expense was lower when compared to the corresponding periods in 2002
due to a decrease in the amount of planned turbine and boiler inspections and
repairs.

     Taxes other than income taxes. During the third quarter and year-to-date
2003, taxes other than income taxes increased as a result of higher property
taxes related to higher plant in service amounts, and higher revenue taxes
related to the 2002 base rate increase when compared to the same periods in the
prior year.

     Other income (expense), net. The decrease in other income for year-to-date
2003 is a result of reductions in Allowance for Equity Funds Used during

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors. The major factors include regulatory matters and the ability to achieve
energy sales growth. For additional information relating to these issues, see
Item 1 - BUSINESS - The SOUTHERN System - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of Gulf Power
in the Form 10-K.

     Gulf Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. In addition, Gulf Power's business activities are
subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the
environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types,
including property damage, personal injury and citizen enforcement of
environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout the United
States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged
exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome
of such litigation against Gulf Power cannot be predicted at this time; however,
management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on Gulf Power's
financial statements.

     Comprehensive energy legislation has been passed by both the U.S. House of
Representatives and the Senate. Significant differences exist in the legislation
and a joint conference is underway to formulate a compromise final bill. While
the form of this final bill is not yet known, it is expected to address a number
of issues related to the electric utility industry and could affect the business
operations and financial condition of Gulf Power.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
regulations could affect earnings if such costs are not fully recovered through
Gulf Power's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause. For additional information
about these issues, including the EPA litigation, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial
statements of Gulf Power in the Form 10-K and Note (E) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein. On October 27, 2003, the EPA published a final rule
providing that certain equipment replacements be excluded from New Source Review
and Prevention of Significant Deterioration provisions of the Clean Air Act
under the definition of "routine maintenance, repair and replacement." This
final rule must be adopted by the State of Florida in order to apply to Gulf
Power's facilities. If fully implemented, this final regulation could affect the
applicability of these regulations to activities at Gulf Power's facilities. The
final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

     In 2002, the Florida PSC approved an annual base rate increase for Gulf
Power of $53.2 million, which became effective in June 2002. Reference is made
to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential"
of Gulf Power in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Gulf Power in the Form 10-K for
information on the formation of an RTO and the notice of proposed rulemaking
regarding open access transmission service and standard electricity market
design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related to its proposed
rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard electricity
market design in an effort to respond to certain of the public comments received
on the proposal. Reactions to the White Paper by certain Southeastern state
regulators reflect significant continuing differences in opinion between the
FERC and those state regulatory commissions over questions of jurisdiction and
protection of retail customers. These significant differences between state

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


and federal regulators create substantial uncertainty related to the ultimate
approval of SeTrans because state commission approval of the transfer of
operational control of the transmission assets of Gulf Power is a prerequisite
to the formation of SeTrans. Pending energy legislation may also impact these
issues. Any impact of the FERC proposals on Gulf Power will depend on the form
in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Gulf Power's revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities could be adversely affected by changes in the
transmission regulatory structure in its regional power market.

     Reference is made to Note (M) to the Condensed Financial Statements for
information regarding FERC approval of the Open Access Transmission Tariff. This
settlement is not expected to have a material effect on Gulf Power's future
earnings.

     Reference is made to the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for discussion of various contingencies and other matters which may affect
future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Gulf Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of Gulf Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Gulf Power's
critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. Gulf Power is subject to
the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation." In the event that a portion of Gulf Power's operations is
no longer subject to these provisions, Gulf Power would be required to write off
related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
and determine if any other assets, including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Gulf Power accrued for
the ultimate costs of retiring most long-lived assets over the life of the
related asset through depreciation expense.

     FASB Statement No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which further amends and clarifies the
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments became effective generally
for financial instruments entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. Current
interpretations of Statement No. 149 indicate that certain electricity forward
transactions subject to unplanned netting (including those typically referred to
as "book outs") may not continue to qualify as cash flow hedges.

                               GULF POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


This conclusion is subject to ongoing discussions with the FASB and may change.
Gulf Power's forward electricity contracts continue to qualify for the normal
sales exception and are recorded on an accrual basis. The implementation of
Statement No. 149 did not have a material effect on Gulf Power's financial
statements.

     In July 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-11, which
addresses the reporting of realized gains and losses on derivative instruments
that became effective on October 1, 2003, and is currently being interpreted to
require book outs to be recorded on a net basis in operating revenues. Adoption
of this standard will not have a material impact on Gulf Power's financial
statements as it affects only the classification of amounts in the Statements of
Income.

     In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,"
which requires classification of certain financial instruments within its scope,
including shares that are mandatorily redeemable, as liabilities. Statement No.
150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003 and otherwise on July 1, 2003. In accordance with Statement No. 150,
Gulf Power reclassified $115 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities as liabilities effective July 1, 2003. The implementation of
Statement No. 150 did not have any impact on Gulf Power's Statements of Income
and Cash Flows.

     FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"
requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate
the related assets and liabilities. On October 9, 2003, the FASB issued Staff
Position No. FIN 46-6, which deferred the effective date of Interpretation No.
46 until December 31, 2003 for interests held in variable interest entities or
potential variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003. Current
analysis indicates that the trusts established by Gulf Power to issue trust
preferred securities are variable interest entities under Interpretation No. 46
and, further, that Gulf Power is not the primary beneficiary of these trusts. If
this conclusion is finalized, effective December 31, 2003, the trust assets and
liabilities, including the preferred securities issued by the trusts, will be
deconsolidated, the investments in the trusts will be reflected under the equity
method, and the loans from the trusts to Gulf Power will be reflected as
long-term notes payable to affiliates on the balance sheet. Based on the
September 30, 2003 values, such treatment would result in an increase of
approximately $3.5 million to both total assets and total liabilities. These
reclassifications would not have any impact on net income or cash flow.


FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Major changes in Gulf Power's financial condition during the first nine months
of 2003 included the addition of approximately $64.8 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See Gulf Power's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows
herein for further details.

Ongoing Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of Gulf Power
under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Other Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of Gulf Power's
capital requirements for its construction program, maturing debt and
environmental compliance efforts.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, Gulf Power
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Gulf Power had at
September 30, 2003 approximately $41 million of cash and cash equivalents and
$66 million of unused committed lines of credit with banks that expire in 2004.
The credit arrangements provide liquidity support to Gulf Power's obligations
with respect to variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper. Gulf
Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at
the request and for the benefit of Gulf Power and other Southern Company
subsidiaries. At September 30, 2003, Gulf Power had no notes payable or
commercial paper outstanding. Management believes that the need for working
capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining
large cash balances.

Credit Rating Risk

Gulf Power does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

Gulf Power's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Gulf Power is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, Gulf Power has limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Gulf Power enters into fixed price contracts for purchase of coal
supplies, the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity
market and, to a lesser extent, similar contracts for gas purchases. Gulf Power
has received approval from the Florida PSC to recover prudently incurred costs
related to its fuel hedging program through the fuel cost recovery mechanism.

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets and
liabilities. Realized gains and losses from these programs are included in fuel
expense and are recovered through Gulf Power's fuel cost recovery clause. Gains
and losses on contracts that do not represent hedges are recognized in the
income statement as incurred. At September 30, 2003, the fair value of
derivative energy contracts was reflected in the financial statements as

Financing Activities

In January 2003, Gulf Power redeemed $40 million of 7.625% trust preferred
securities using the proceeds of $40 million in trust preferred securities
issued in December 2002 at a five-year initial fixed rate of 5.60%.

     In the first half of 2003, Gulf Power issued $65 million of Senior Notes.
The proceeds from this issue was used to redeem $40 million of Senior Notes and
$25 million of Junior Subordinated Notes.

     In April 2003, Gulf Power sold through public authorities $29.075 million
of variable rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds due February 1, 2026
and $32.55 million of variable rate pollution control refunding bonds due June
1, 2023. The proceeds were used to redeem (1) $7.875 million aggregate principal
amount of water pollution control revenue refunding bonds, Series 1993; (2)
$21.2 million of pollution control revenue refunding bonds, Series 1996 and (3)
the outstanding amount of pollution control revenue refunding bonds, Series
1993. Both pollution control bonds issued in April 2003 will bear interest at a
rate to be determined by the auction rate process.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In July 2003, Gulf Power issued $60 million of Series G 4.35% Senior Notes
due July 15, 2013 and $60 million of Series H 5.25% Senior Notes due July 15,
2033. The proceeds of the Series G Senior Notes were used to pay at maturity the
$60 million outstanding principal amount of Series C 4.69% Senior Notes due
August 1, 2003. The proceeds of the Series H Senior Notes were used to redeem in
August 2003 the $46.7 million outstanding principal amount of the Series A 6.70%
Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due June 30, 2038. The remainder was used to
repay a portion of Gulf Power's short-term indebtedness.

     In September 2003, Gulf Power issued $40 million of Series I 5.75% Senior
Notes due September 15, 2033. The proceeds from this issue were used in October
2003 to redeem the $45 million outstanding principal amount of Gulf Power
Capital Trust II 7.00% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities.

     Gulf Power plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    THIRD QUARTER 2003 vs. THIRD QUARTER 2002

                     YEAR-TO-DATE 2003 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 2002


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Mississippi Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the third
quarter and year-to-date 2003 was $34.4 million and $108.8 million,
respectively, compared to $33.4 million and $68.1 million for the corresponding
periods of 2002. Earnings in the third quarter and year-to-date 2003 increased
by $1 million, or 3%, and $40.7 million, or 59.7%, respectively. The third
quarter 2003 increase in earnings is attributed to lower maintenance expense, a
decrease in interest expense and the recognition of revenue under a transmission
facilities agreement previously reserved for refund in accordance with a recent
order from the FERC. Reference is made to Note (R) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for additional information on the FERC order. The year-to-date
2003 increase is primarily a result of a gain of $38 million after-tax related
to the termination of a PPA with Dynegy. Reference is made to Note (N) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information regarding the
termination of this PPA.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

N/M  Not meaningful

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue for the third quarter 2003 remained flat when
compared to the same period in 2002 but decreased by $1.2 million, or 0.5%,
year-to-date 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002 is a result of
decreases in retail kilowatt-hour energy sales. The reason for the flat and
downward results is lower kilowatt-hour energy sales due to milder-than-normal
weather in Mississippi Power's service area and the sluggish economy.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. The increased revenues from sales for
resale to non-affiliates in the third quarter and year-to-date 2003 are
primarily due to an increase in the average sales price per kilowatt-hour and
increased kilowatt-hour energy sales to wholesale non-affiliated customers when
compared to the corresponding periods in 2002.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the Southern Company system will vary depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is
generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by
energy revenues through Mississippi Power's retail and wholesale fuel cost
recovery clauses.

     Contract termination. This reflects the $62 million of revenues recorded
upon the termination of a PPA with Dynegy. Reference is made to Note (N) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information.

     Other revenues. The third quarter and year-to-date 2003 decreases in other
revenues when compared to the same periods in 2002 are mainly attributed to an
environmental insurance refund of approximately $1 million recorded in 2002.

     Fuel expense. In the third quarter and year-to-date 2003, fuel expense was
lower as a result of decreased generation in both of these periods and the lower
cost of fuel when compared to the same periods in 2002. In the third quarter
2003, Mississippi Power had opportunities to purchase power at rates less than
the cost to generate it. Since energy expenses are generally offset by energy
revenues through Mississippi Power's retail and wholesale fuel cost recovery
clauses, these expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power-non-affiliates. The decrease in this expense in the third
quarter 2003 is primarily attributed to increased utilization of electricity
within the Southern Company system when compared to the same period in 2002 as a
result of mild summer weather in Southern Company's retail service territory.
The year-to-date 2003 increase in purchased power from non-affiliates is a
result of more economical power being available for purchase from these sources.

     Other operation expense. In the third quarter 2003, other operation expense
remained relatively flat but increased year-to-date 2003 as a result of
approximately $11 million incurred to restructure the lease agreement for the
combined cycle generating units at Plant Daniel in the second quarter of 2003.
Reference is made to Note (S) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
additional information.

     Maintenance expense. The third quarter and year-to-date 2003 decreases in
maintenance expenses, when compared to the corresponding periods in the prior
year, are primarily due to scheduled maintenance performed at Plant Watson and
Plant Daniel in 2002 and lower maintenance expense associated with a long-term
service agreement associated with the combined cycle units.

     Interest expense. The decreases in the third quarter and year-to-date 2003
as compared to the same periods in 2002 are attributed to a lower amount of debt
outstanding and lower interest rates.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Other income (expense), net. The increases in other income during the third
quarter and year-to-date 2003 are primarily attributed to the recognition of
revenue previously reserved for refund as a result of a FERC order related to a
contract for the use of transmission facilities. Reference is made to Note (R)
to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales. For additional information relating to these issues, see Item 1
- - BUSINESS - The SOUTHERN System - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of Mississippi Power in
the Form 10-K.

     Mississippi Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in
the ordinary course of business. In addition, Mississippi Power's business
activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public
health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of
various types, including property damage, personal injury and citizen
enforcement of environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout
the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by
alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate
outcome of such litigation against Mississippi Power cannot be predicted at this
time; however, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any,
arising from such current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on
Mississippi Power's financial statements.

     Mississippi Power's 2003 ECO Plan filing was approved, as filed, by the
Mississippi PSC on March 18, 2003, and resulted in a slight increase in rates
effective April 2003. Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other
environmental regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to
be recovered. For additional information about these issues, including the EPA
litigation, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power in the Form
10-K and Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Mississippi Power in the Form 10-K
for information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice
of proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Reactions to
the White Paper by Southeastern state regulators reflect significant continuing
differences in opinion between the FERC and various state regulatory commissions
over questions of jurisdiction and protection of retail customers. These
significant differences between state and federal regulators create substantial
uncertainty related to the ultimate approval of SeTrans because state commission
approval of the transfer approval of operational control of the transmission
assets of Southern Company and its subsidiaries is a prerequisite to the
formation of SeTrans. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues.
Any impact of the FERC proposals on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will
depend on the form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however,
Mississippi Power's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities could be
adversely affected by changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its
regional power market.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Reference is made to Note (M) to the Condensed Financial Statements for
information regarding FERC approval of the Open Access Transmission Tariff. This
settlement is not expected to have a material effect on Mississippi Power's
future earnings.

     Comprehensive energy legislation has been passed by both the U.S. House of
Representatives and the Senate. Significant differences exist in the legislation
and a joint conference is underway to formulate a compromise final bill. While
the form of this final bill is not yet known, it is expected to address a number
of issues related to the electric utility industry and could affect the business
operations and financial condition of Mississippi Power.

     Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. On October 27, 2003, the EPA published a
final rule providing that certain equipment replacements be excluded from New
Source Review and Prevention of Significant Deterioration provisions of the
Clean Air Act under the definition of "routine maintenance, repair and
replacement." This final rule must be adopted by the State of Mississippi in
order to apply to Mississippi Power's facilities. If fully implemented, this
final regulation could affect the applicability of these regulations to
activities at Mississippi Power's facilities. The final outcome of these matters
cannot now be determined.

     Reference is made to Note (N) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding the termination of a PPA between Dynegy and
Mississippi Power. As a result of this PPA termination, Mississippi Power
continues to review alternatives for this capacity. The final outcome of this
matter cannot now be determined.

     Reference is made to the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for discussion of various contingencies and other matters which may affect
future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policies

Mississippi Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
the financial statements of Mississippi Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.
Mississippi Power's critical accounting policies involve rate regulation and
lease accounting.

     Mississippi Power is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,
"Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a
portion of Mississippi Power's operations is no longer subject to these
provisions, Mississippi Power would be required to write off related regulatory
assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable and determine if
any other assets, including plant, have been impaired.

     Additionally, Mississippi Power accounts for its lease of two generating
units at Plant Daniel, totaling 1,064 megawatts of capacity, as an operating
lease. Reference is made to Note (S) of the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for an explanation of the restructuring activity that took place during
the second quarter of 2003 to allow for continued off-balance sheet accounting
treatment. Effective July 1, 2003, FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities" would have required Mississippi Power to consolidate
the assets and liabilities of Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership
("Escatawpa"), the special purpose entity from which Mississippi Power leased
the units. Under the restructured lease with Juniper Capital L.P. ("Juniper"),
consolidation is not required.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Mississippi Power
accrued for the ultimate costs of retiring most long-lived assets over the life
of the related asset through depreciation expense.

     FASB Statement No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which further amends and clarifies the
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments became effective generally
for financial instruments entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. Current
interpretations of Statement No. 149 indicate that certain electricity forward
transactions subject to unplanned netting (including those typically referred to
as "book outs") may not continue to qualify as cash flow hedges.
This conclusion is subject to ongoing discussions with the FASB and may change.
Mississippi Power's forward electricity contracts continue to qualify for the
normal sales exception and are recorded on an accrual basis. The implementation
of Statement No. 149 did not have a material effect on Mississippi Power's
financial statements.

     In July 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-11, which
addresses the reporting of realized gains and losses on derivative instruments
that became effective on October 1, 2003, and is currently being interpreted to
require book outs to be recorded on a net basis in operating revenues. Adoption
of this standard will not have a material impact on Mississippi Power's
financial statements as it affects only the classification of amounts in the
Statements of Income.

     FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others" requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a
liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
guarantee. This interpretation applies to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45, Mississippi
Power has recorded a $15.2 million liability for the fair value of its residual
value guarantee associated with the lease of two generating units at Plant
Daniel. Reference is made to Note (S) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for additional information.

     In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,"
which requires classification of certain financial instruments within its scope,
including shares that are mandatorily redeemable, as liabilities. Statement No.
150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003 and otherwise on July 1, 2003. In accordance with Statement No. 150,
Mississippi Power reclassified $35 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities as liabilities effective July 1, 2003. The implementation of
Statement No. 150 did not have any impact on Mississippi Power's Statements of
Income and Cash Flows.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"
requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate
the related assets and liabilities. On July 1, 2003, Mississippi Power adopted
Interpretation No. 46 with no financial statement impact following completion of
restructuring of Mississippi Power's lease arrangement for the combined cycle
generating units at Plant Daniel. See Financial Condition - "Off-Balance Sheet
Financing Arrangements" below and Note (S) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for further information on the lease restructuring. On October 9, 2003,
the FASB issued Staff Position No. FIN 46-6, which deferred the effective date
of Interpretation No. 46 until December 31, 2003 for interests held in variable
interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before
February 1, 2003. Current analysis indicates that the trust established by
Mississippi Power to issue trust preferred securities is a variable interest
entity under Interpretation No. 46 and, further, that Mississippi Power is not
the primary beneficiary of the trust. If this conclusion is finalized, effective
December 31, 2003, the trust assets and liabilities, including the preferred
securities issued by the trust, will be deconsolidated, the investments in the
trust will be reflected under the equity method, and the loans from the trust
to Mississippi Power will be reflected as long-term notes payable to affiliates
on the balance sheet. Based on the September 30, 2003 values, such treatment
would result in an increase of approximately $1.1 million to both total assets
and total liabilities. These reclassifications would not have any impact on net
income or cash flow.


FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Major changes in Mississippi Power's financial condition during the first nine
months of 2003 included the addition of approximately $41.6 million to utility
plant. The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operating activities. See Mississippi Power's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows herein for further details.

Ongoing Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
Mississippi Power under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" and Note 3 to the financial statements
in the Form 10-K for a description of Mississippi Power's capital requirements
for its construction program, environmental compliance efforts and maturities of
long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, Mississippi
Power plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     Mississippi Power's current liabilities exceed current assets due to
scheduled maturities of long-term debt. Mississippi Power expects to refinance
these maturities with additional long-term debt.

<PAGE>


                            MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Mississippi Power had at
September 30, 2003 approximately $72.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and
$99.5 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks that expire in
2003 and 2004. Approximately $37 million of these credit arrangements contain
provisions allowing two-year term loans executable at expiration date. The
credit arrangements provide liquidity support to Mississippi Power's obligations
with respect to variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper.
Mississippi Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible
commercial notes at the request and for the benefit of Mississippi Power and
other Southern Company subsidiaries. At September 30, 2003, Mississippi Power
had no outstanding commercial paper. Management believes that the need for
working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In May 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of an operating
lease agreement with Escatawpa, a special purpose entity, to use a
combined-cycle generating facility located at Mississippi Power's Plant Daniel.
The facility cost approximately $370 million. Reference is made to Note 8 to the
financial statements of Mississippi Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K under
"Lease Agreements," "Critical Policies" above and Note (S) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for additional information. In June 2003, Escatawpa
sold its ownership interests in the facility to Juniper. Simultaneously, Juniper
entered into a restructured lease agreement with Mississippi Power. The terms of
the lease with Juniper are substantially the same as the lease with Escatawpa.
In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46, Mississippi Power is not required
to consolidate the leased assets and related liabilities. Furthermore, the
restructured lease agreement is an operating lease under FASB Statement No. 13,
"Accounting for Leases." Accordingly, the lease is not reflected on the
condensed balance sheet of Mississippi Power.

Credit Rating Risk

Mississippi Power does not have any credit agreements that would require
material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit
rating downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

Mississippi Power's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have
not changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Mississippi Power is not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulation, Mississippi Power has limited exposure
to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Mississippi Power enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and
sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market. Mississippi Power
has also implemented retail fuel hedging programs at the instruction of its PSC
and wholesale fuel hedging programs under agreements with wholesale customers.
The fair value of derivative, fuel and energy contracts was as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to the retail and wholesale fuel hedging programs are recorded as
regulatory assets and liabilities. Realized gains and losses from these programs
are included in fuel expense and are recovered through Mississippi Power's
energy cost management clauses. Reference is made to Note 1 to the financial
statements of Mississippi Power under "Financial Instruments" in Item 8 of the
Form 10-K regarding the respective approvals of the retail and wholesale energy
cost management clauses. Gains and losses on contracts that do not represent
hedges are recognized in the Statements of Income as incurred. At September 30,
2003, the fair value of derivative energy contracts reflected in the financial
statements was as follows:

                                                    Amounts

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Financing Activities

In April 2003, Mississippi Power issued $90 million of Series E 5-5/8% Senior
Notes due May 1, 2033. The proceeds from this sale were used to repay at
maturity $35 million of Mississippi Power's Series B 6.05% Senior Notes due May
1, 2003, to redeem the $51.6 million outstanding principal amount of Mississippi
Power's Series A 6.75% Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due June 30, 2038 and to
repay a portion of Mississippi Power's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     Mississippi Power plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to
retire higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    THIRD QUARTER 2003 vs. THIRD QUARTER 2002
                                       AND
                     YEAR-TO-DATE 2003 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 2002

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Savannah Electric's net income for the third quarter and year-to-date 2003 was
$14.4 million and $24.2 million, respectively, compared to $13.1 million and
$22.0 million for the corresponding periods of 2002. Earnings increased by $1.2
million, or 9.4%, and $2.2 million, or 10%, in the third quarter and
year-to-date 2003, respectively, due primarily to higher operating revenues
resulting primarily from the June 2002 base rate increase, an increase in other
income, net and a decrease in interest expense which was partially offset by
operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

</TABLE>

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which do not affect net income,
retail sales revenue decreased by $0.3 million, or 0.5%, in the third quarter
2003 and increased by $1.9 million, or 1.4%, year-to-date 2003 when compared to
the corresponding periods in 2002. The third quarter 2003 decrease in retail
sales revenue is mainly attributed to a 3.1% decrease in retail kilowatt-hour
energy sales as a result of milder-than-normal temperatures. The year-to-date
2003 increase is primarily due to the base rate increase that took effect in
June 2002, as well as increased usage by several industrial customers.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. In the third quarter and year-to-date
2003, revenues from sales for resale to non-affiliates increased due to higher
demand for energy of 13.5% and 25.5%, respectively.

     Sales for resale - affiliates. Revenues from sales for resale to affiliated
companies within the Southern Company system will vary depending on demand and
the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. Sales for
resale to affiliates increased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2003
primarily due to the combination of increased demand by Southern Power to meet
contractual obligations and the availability of power due to milder-than-normal
weather in Savannah Electric's service territory. These transactions do not have
a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. The third quarter and year-to-date 2003 increases in other
revenues when compared to the same periods in 2002 are attributed to new
miscellaneous service fees implemented as part of the 2002 base rate case.

     Purchased power - affiliates. Purchased power from affiliates increased in
the third quarter and year-to date 2003 due to the Plant Wansley PPA between
Savannah Electric and Southern Power that began in June 2002. The capacity
component of these transactions remained constant in the third quarter 2003 and
increased by $5.9 million year-to-date 2003 when compared to the corresponding
periods in 2002. Capacity costs of purchased power are generally recovered
through base rates. In December 2002, an accounting order was approved by the
Georgia PSC which allows Savannah Electric to defer approximately $3.8 million
annually in Plant Wansley purchased power costs, which the Georgia PSC had ruled
to be outside of the test period in Savannah Electric's base rate order. The net
impact of these transactions year-to-date 2003 was a decrease to purchased
power expense of $0.5 million. Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" and to Note 3 under
"Retail Regulatory Matters to the financial statements in Item 8 in the Form
10-K for Savannah Electric for additional information on the Georgia PSC
December 2002 order. Purchased power from affiliates also included energy
purchases which will vary depending on demand and cost of generation resources
at each company. These energy costs are recovered through the fuel cost recovery
clause and have no significant impact on earnings.

     Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. During the third quarter and
year-to-date 2003, this expense decreased as a result of both a lower amount of
debt outstanding and lower interest rates when compared to the same periods in
the prior year.

     Other income (expense), net. The increases in income during the third
quarter and year-to-date 2003 are primarily attributed to a distribution of the
proceeds from the sale of a mutual life insurance company in which Savannah
Electric held policies used to fund its non-qualified benefit plans. This income
was partially offset by increased contributions.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors which include maintaining a stable regulatory environment and achieving
energy sales growth while containing costs. For additional information relating
to these issues, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - The SOUTHERN System -
"Risks Factors" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of Savannah Electric in the Form 10-K.

     Savannah Electric is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in
the ordinary course of business. In addition, Savannah Electric's business
activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public
health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of
various types, including property damage, personal injury and citizen
enforcement of environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout
the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by
alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate
outcome of such litigation against Savannah

Electric cannot be predicted at this time; however, management does not
anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings
would have a material adverse effect on Savannah Electric's financial
statements.

     Comprehensive energy legislation has been passed by both the U.S. House of
Representatives and the Senate. Significant differences exist in the legislation
and a joint conference is underway to formulate a compromise final bill. While
the form of this final bill is not yet known, it is expected to address a number
of issues related to the electric utility industry and could affect the business
operations and financial condition of Savannah Electric.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For
additional information about these issues, including the EPA litigation, see
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note
3 to the financial statements of Savannah Electric in the Form 10-K and Note (E)
to the Condensed Financial Statements herein. On October 27, 2003, the EPA
published a final rule providing that certain equipment replacements be excluded
from New Source Review and Prevention of Significant Deterioration provisions of
the Clean Air Act under the definition of "routine maintenance, repair and
replacement." This final rule must be adopted by the State of Georgia in order
to apply to Savannah Electric's facilities. If fully implemented, this final
regulation could affect the applicability of these regulations to activities at
Savannah Electric's facilities. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be
determined.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Savannah Electric in the Form 10-K
for information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice
of proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Reactions to
the White Paper by Southeastern state regulators reflect significant continuing
differences in opinion between the FERC and various state regulatory commissions
over questions of jurisdiction and protection of retail customers. These
significant differences between state and federal regulators create substantial
uncertainty related to the ultimate approval of SeTrans because state commission
approval of the transfer of operational control of the transmission assets of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries is a prerequisite to the formation of
SeTrans. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any impact of
the FERC proposals on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on the
form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Savannah
Electric's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities could be adversely
affected by changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its regional
power market.

     Reference is made to Note (M) to the Condensed Financial Statements for
information regarding FERC approval of the Open Access Transmission Tariff. This
settlement is not expected to have a material effect on Savannah Electric's
future earnings.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Savannah Electric's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
the financial statements of Savannah Electric in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.
Savannah Electric's critical accounting policy involves rate regulation.
Savannah Electric is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,
"Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a
portion of Savannah Electric's operations is no longer subject to these
provisions, Savannah Electric would be required to write off related regulatory
assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable and determine if
any other assets have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Savannah Electric
accrued for the ultimate cost of retiring most long-lived assets over the life
of the related asset through depreciation expense.

     FASB Statement No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which further amends and clarifies the
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments became effective generally
for financial instruments entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. Current
interpretations of Statement No. 149 indicate that certain electricity forward
transactions subject to unplanned netting (including those typically referred to
as "book outs") may not continue to qualify as cash flow hedges. This conclusion
is subject to ongoing discussions with the FASB and may change. Savannah
Electric's forward electricity contracts continue to qualify for the normal
sales exception and are recorded on an accrual basis. The implementation of
Statement No. 149 did not have a material effect on Savannah Electric's
financial statements.

                       SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In July 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-11, which
addresses the reporting of realized gains and losses on derivative instruments
that became effective on October 1, 2003, and is currently being interpreted to
require book outs to be recorded on a net basis in operating revenues. Adoption
of this standard will not have a material impact on Savannah Electric's
financial statements as it affects only the classification of amounts in the
Statements of Income.

     In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,"
which requires classification of certain financial instruments within its scope,
including shares that are mandatorily redeemable, as liabilities. Statement No.
150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003 and otherwise on July 1, 2003. In accordance with Statement No. 150,
Savannah Electric reclassified $40 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities as liabilities effective July 1, 2003. The implementation of
Statement No. 150 did not have any impact on Savannah Electric's Statements of
Income and Cash Flows.

     FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"
requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate
the related assets and liabilities. On October 9, 2003, the FASB issued Staff
Position No. FIN 46-6, which deferred the effective date of Interpretation No.
46 until December 31, 2003 for interests held in variable interest entities or
potential variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003. Current
analysis indicates that the trust established by Savannah Electric to issue
trust preferred securities is a variable interest entity under Interpretation
No. 46 and, further, that Savannah Electric is not the primary beneficiary of
the trust. If this conclusion is finalized, effective December 31, 2003, the
trust assets and liabilities, including the preferred securities issued by the
trust, will be deconsolidated, the investments in the trust will be reflected
under the equity method, and the loans from the trust to Savannah Electric will
be reflected as long-term notes payable to affiliates on the balance sheet.
Based on the September 30, 2003 values, such treatment would result in an
increase of approximately $1.2 million to both total assets and total
liabilities. These reclassifications would not have any impact on net income or
cash flow.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in Savannah Electric's financial condition during the first nine
months of 2003 included the addition of approximately $27.5 million to utility
plant. The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations. See Savannah Electric's Condensed Statements of Cash
Flows herein for further details.

Ongoing Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of Savannah
Electric under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Other Capital
Requirements" and "Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of
Savannah Electric's capital requirements for its construction program, maturing
debt and environmental compliance efforts.

                       SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Sources of Capital

Savannah Electric plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of
adequate earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other
factors. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for
additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Savannah Electric had at
September 30, 2003 approximately $2.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and
$55 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks, of which $10
million expires in 2003 and $45 million expires in 2004 and beyond. Of the
unused credit arrangements expiring in 2003 and 2004, $30 million include two
year term loan options executable at the expiration date. The credit
arrangements provide liquidity support to some of Savannah Electric's
obligations with respect to its variable rate debt and its commercial paper.
Savannah Electric may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible
commercial notes at the request and for the benefit of Savannah Electric and
other Southern Company subsidiaries. At September 30, 2003, Savannah Electric
had $9 million of outstanding commercial paper. Since Savannah Electric has no
major generating plants under construction, management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

Credit Rating Risk

Savannah Electric does not have any credit agreements that would require
material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit
rating downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

Savannah Electric's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have
not changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Savannah Electric is not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, Savannah Electric has limited exposure
to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Savannah Electric enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and
sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser
extent, similar contracts for gas and oil purchases. Savannah Electric has also
implemented a retail fuel hedging program at the instruction of the Georgia PSC.
The fair value of derivative energy contracts at September 30, 2003 was as
follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to the retail fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets
and liabilities. At September 30, 2003, Savannah Electric had approximately $0.4
million in regulatory assets related to unrealized losses on mark to market
derivative contracts associated with its fuel hedging programs. Gains and losses
on contracts that do not represent hedges are recognized in the Statements of
Income as incurred.

     For additional information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Exposure to Market Risks" of Savannah Electric in the
Form 10-K and Note 1 to the financial statements of Savannah Electric in Item 8
of the Form 10-K.

Financing Activities

In February 2003, Savannah Electric sold through a public authority an aggregate
principal amount of $13.87 million of variable rate Pollution Control Revenue
Bonds, Series 2003 due February 1, 2038. The proceeds from this sale, together
with any investment proceeds and other moneys of Savannah Electric, were used to
redeem $13.87 million aggregate principal amount of Pollution Control Revenue
Bonds, Series 1997. The 2003 bonds will bear interest at a rate to be determined
by the auction rate process.

     In July 2003, Savannah Electric entered into a swap to hedge interest
payments associated with an anticipated debt issuance planned in December 2003.
The swap is for a notional amount of $25 million at a fixed interest rate of
5.025% and matures in December 2013. In addition, Savannah Electric entered into
a swap to hedge interest payments associated with a variable rate bank note. The
swap is for a notional amount of $20 million at a fixed interest rate of 2.06%
and matures in December 2004.

     Savannah Electric plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to
retire higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Southern Power's net income for third quarter and year-to-date 2003 was $40.1
million and $142.5 million, respectively, compared to $27.3 million and $40.6
million for the corresponding periods of 2002. The increase in third quarter
2003 earnings of $12.8 million, or 46.9%, was due primarily to the sale of
wholesale capacity and energy under new PPAs with Alabama Power and Georgia
Power beginning in June 2003 for Plant Franklin Unit 2 and Plant Harris Unit 1.
Additional sales to affiliated and non-affiliated companies from Plant Harris
Unit 2, which also went into service in June 2003, were another factor in the
increase. The year-to-date 2003 increase in earnings of $101.9 million, or
250.8%, is attributed primarily to a gain of $50 million recognized in May 2003
upon the termination of Dynegy's obligations under PPAs related to Plant
Dahlberg and Plant Franklin. Reference is made to Note (N) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for additional information regarding the termination
of these PPAs. Other factors contributing to the increases for the third quarter
and year-to-date 2003 were non-recurring energy sales transactions related to
test period generation for units placed in service in June 2003, as well as
manufacturer's tax credits from the State of Georgia related to construction of
Plants Dahlberg and Wansley.

                             SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. In the third quarter and year-to-date
2003, revenues from sales for resale to non-affiliates were higher when compared
to the corresponding periods in 2002. The reasons for these increases were
additional wholesale capacity and energy sales to non-affiliates due to
commercial operation of Plant Franklin Unit 1, which was not fully obligated
under a long-term PPA until June 2003, and test period energy sales transactions
for Plant Franklin Unit 2 and Plant Harris Units 1 and 2 which were placed into
commercial operation in June 2003 and which provided some additional available
capacity.

     Sales for resale - affiliates. During the third quarter and year-to-date
2003, sales for resale to affiliates increased primarily due to a full nine
months of energy and capacity sales through PPAs with Georgia Power and Savannah
Electric that began in June 2002. New PPAs with Alabama Power and Georgia Power
that commenced in June 2003 also contributed to the increase. Revenues from
sales to affiliated companies through the Southern Company system power pool
("Southern Pool") and energy sales under PPAs will vary depending on demand and
the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the
Southern Pool.

     Contract termination. This revenue is the result of the May 2003
termination of Dynegy's PPAs related to Plants Dahlberg and Franklin. Reference
is made to Note (N) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for further
information.

     Other revenues. In the third quarter and year-to-date 2003, the increases
in other revenues are primarily attributed to scheduling and administrative fees
on wholesale contracts that were not in place during the first half of 2002.

     Fuel expense. Fuel expense in the third quarter 2003 decreased slightly but
increased year-to-date 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002. The third
quarter 2003 decrease was the result of a reduction in generation and the
utilization of lower cost purchased power to fulfill commitments. The
year-to-date 2003 increase resulted from commercial operation of units at Plant
Wansley and Plant Franklin Unit 1 in June 2002 as well as commercial operation
of new units at Plant Franklin and Plant Harris Units 1 and 2 in June 2003.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. The decrease in purchased power from
non-affiliates during the third quarter 2003 is primarily due to the
availability of lower cost energy from affiliates, primarily as a result of mild
summer weather in the Southern Company's retail service territory. The
year-to-date 2003 increase in purchased power from non-affiliates when compared
to the corresponding period in 2002 is mainly due to the availability of market
power at prices lower than Southern Power's self generation or from affiliates,
and the effects of purchase power provisions in the contracts with the electric
membership cooperatives, the City of Dalton, Georgia and the North Carolina
Municipal Power Authority 1.

     Purchased power - affiliates. The availability of power at prices lower
than Southern Power's self-generation accounted for the third quarter and
year-to-date 2003 increases in purchased power from affiliates. Expenses from
purchased power transactions will vary depending on demand, availability and the
cost of generating resources accessible throughout the Southern Company system.

     Other operation expense. During the third quarter and year-to-date 2003,
other operation expense increased when compared to the same periods in the prior
year due mainly to administrative and general expenses associated with the
commercial operation of units at Plant Wansley and Plant Franklin Unit 1 in June
2002 as well as commercial operation of new units at Plant Franklin and Plant
Harris Units 1 and 2 in June 2003.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Depreciation and amortization. New generating units placed into service in
June 2003 are the main drivers for the increases in depreciation and
amortization in the third quarter. The units placed in service in June 2002 are
the other significant factor in the year-to-date 2003 increase when compared to
the corresponding period in 2002.

     Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. In the third quarter and
year-to-date 2003, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased when
compared to the same periods in 2002 due to a lower percentage of interest costs
being capitalized as projects have reached completion and an increase in the
amount of senior notes outstanding.

     Other income (expense), net. The third quarter and year-to-date 2003
changes in this item are principally due to lower unrealized losses on
derivative energy contracts during these periods as compared to the same periods
in 2002. See "Exposure to Market Risks" herein for additional information on
these derivative energy contracts.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future earnings. The
level of future earnings depends on numerous factors including completion of
construction on new generating facilities, regulatory matters, energy sales,
creditworthiness of customers, total generating capacity available in the Super
Southeast and the remarketing of capacity. For additional information relating
to these issues, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - The SOUTHERN System - "Risk Factors"
and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential"
of Southern Power in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - General" and to Note 5 to the financial statements
of Southern Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information on
long-term power sales agreements and PPAs. Southern Power's PPAs with
non-affiliated counterparties have provisions that require the posting of
collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee in the event that S&P or
Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of such counterparty to below-investment
grade, or, if the counterparty is not rated, fails to maintain a minimum
coverage ratio. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable
source of revenue during their respective terms.

     In June 2003, Southern Power placed Plant Franklin Unit 2 and Plant Harris
Units 1 and 2 into commercial operation. In October 2003, Southern Power placed
Plant Stanton A into commercial operation. In June 2004, Southern Power's PPA
with Georgia Power will begin for Plant Harris Unit 2. PPAs for the other units
became effective upon commercial operation. Southern Power also has Plant
McIntosh Units 10 and 11 under construction. Reference is made to Note (Q) to
the Condensed Financial Statements herein for information regarding the FERC
approval process for Southern Power's PPAs with Georgia Power and Savannah
Electric for Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11. Reference is also made to Note (N)
to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for information regarding the
termination of PPAs between Dynegy and Southern Power. Because of the
terminations of the PPAs, Southern Power is completing limited construction
activities on Plant Franklin Unit 3 to preserve the long-term viability of the
project. Current projections indicate completion in the 2008-2011 period. The
length of the deferral period will depend on forecasted capacity needs and other
wholesale market opportunities. Southern Power is also continuing to explore
alternatives for their existing capacity. The final outcome of these matters
cannot now be determined.

                             SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In July 2003, Southern Power entered into a five-year contract with
Piedmont Municipal Power Authority (PMPA) beginning January 1, 2006. PMPA is a
full requirements provider to 10 South Carolina cities. The contract is
projected to yield sales of 135 megawatts in 2006, growing to 181 megawatts in
the fifth year of the contract.

     Comprehensive energy legislation has been passed by both the U.S. House of
Representatives and the Senate. Significant differences exist in the legislation
and a joint conference is underway to formulate a compromise final bill. While
the form of this final bill is not yet known, it is expected to address a number
of issues related to the electric utility industry and could affect the business
operations and financial condition of Southern Power.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of Southern Power in the Form 10-K for information on
the development by federal and state environmental regulatory agencies of
additional control strategies for emission of air pollution from all major
sources of air pollution, particularly electric generating facilities.
Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws and
regulations could affect earnings if such costs are not fully recovered.

     Southern Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in
the ordinary course of business. In addition, Southern Power's business
activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public
health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of
various types, including property damage, personal injury and citizen
enforcement of environmental requirements, has increased generally throughout
the United States; in particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by
alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate
outcome of such litigation against Southern Power cannot be predicted at this
time; however, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any,
arising from such current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on
Southern Power's financial statements.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Southern Company in the Form 10-K
for information on the formation of an RTO and the notice of proposed rulemaking
regarding open access transmission service and standard electricity market
design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related to its proposed
rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard electricity
market design in an effort to respond to certain of the public comments received
on the proposal. Reactions to the White Paper by certain Southeastern state
regulators reflect significant continuing differences in opinion between the
FERC and those state regulatory commissions over questions of jurisdiction and
protection of retail customers. These significant differences between state and
federal regulators create substantial uncertainty related to the ultimate
approval of SeTrans because state commission approval of the transfer of
operational control of the transmission assets of Southern Company and its
subsidiaries is a prerequisite to the formation of SeTrans. Pending energy
legislation may also impact these issues. Any impact of the FERC proposals on
Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on the form in which final
rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Southern Company's revenues, expenses,
assets and liabilities could be adversely affected by changes in the
transmission regulatory structure in its regional power market.

     Reference is also made to the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for discussion of various contingencies and other matters which may
affect future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policies

Southern Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of Southern Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Southern
Power has three critical accounting policies that require a significant amount
of judgment and are considered to be the most important to the presentation of
Southern Power's financial position and results of operations. The first
critical policy is the recognition of capacity revenues from long-term contracts
at the lesser of the levelized basis or the cash collected over the contract
periods. Second, Southern Power designates qualifying derivative instruments as
cash flow or fair value hedges and marks such derivative instruments to market
based primarily on quoted market prices. The unrealized changes in fair value of
qualifying cash flow hedges are deferred in Other Comprehensive Income. Any
ineffectiveness in those hedges and changes in non-qualifying positions are
reported as a component of current period income. Finally, Southern Power uses
flow-through accounting for state manufacturer's tax credits. This means that
Southern Power recognizes the credit as a reduction of tax expense when it is
more likely than not to be allowed by the Georgia Department of Revenue.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Southern Power has no
legal liability for asset retirement obligations as defined by FASB Statement
No. 143. Upon adoption, Southern Power recorded a cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle of $0.6 million, representing previously accrued removal
costs.

     FASB Statement No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which further amends and clarifies the
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments became effective generally
for financial instruments entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. Current
interpretations of Statement No. 149 indicate that certain electricity forward
transactions subject to unplanned netting (including those typically referred to
as "book outs") may not continue to qualify as cash flow hedges. This conclusion
is subject to ongoing discussions with the FASB and may change. Southern Power's
forward electricity contracts continue to qualify for the normal sales exception
and are recorded on an accrual basis. The implementation of Statement No. 149
did not have a material effect on Southern Power's financial statements.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In July 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-11, which
addresses the reporting of realized gains and losses on derivative instruments
that became effective on October 1, 2003, and is currently being interpreted to
require book outs to be recorded on a net basis in operating revenues. Adoption
of this standard will not have a material impact on Southern Power's financial
statements as it affects only the classification of amounts in the Statements of
Income.


FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The major change in Southern Power's financial condition during the first nine
months of 2003 was the addition of approximately $278 million to utility plant
related to on-going construction of Southern Power's combined-cycle units. The
funds for these additions were provided by Southern Power's credit facility,
commercial paper program, subordinated loans from Southern Company, the Series C
Senior Notes issued in July 2003 and ongoing operations. See Southern Power's
Condensed Statements of Cash Flows herein for further details.

Ongoing Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements for Construction" and "Other Capital Requirements" of Southern
Power in the Form 10-K for a description of Southern Power's capital
requirements for its construction program, maturing debt, purchase commitments
and long-term service agreements.

Financing Activities

During the first nine months of 2003, Southern Power repaid subordinated loans
from Southern Company of approximately $20 million, net of additional
borrowings. In March 2003, $190 million of notes payable to Southern Company
were converted to a capital contribution from Southern Company. Reference is
made to Note 7 in Southern Power's Form 10-K for information regarding its
unsecured revolving credit facility and subordinated loans from Southern
Company. Effective April 2003, the credit facility for Southern Power was
reduced to $650 million to reflect lower short-term borrowing needs. In
September 2003, the SEC approved Southern Power's payment of dividends in an
amount up to $190 million to Southern Company from capital surplus. The first
such dividend of $77 million, recorded as a reduction of paid-in capital, was
made in October 2003. Equity contributions and subordinated loans from Southern
Company are projected to total approximately $850 million to Southern Power by
the end of 2003. No additional dividends are projected to be paid in 2003.

     In July 2003, Southern Power issued $575 million of 4.875% Senior Notes,
Series C due July 15, 2015. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay a
substantial portion of existing short-term indebtedness, to settle interest rate
hedges associated with this financing and for general corporate purposes.
Reference is made to Note (L) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding these hedges.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Sources of Capital

Southern Power's current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of
the continued use of short-term debt as an interim funding source for Southern
Power's ongoing construction program and the seasonality of the electricity
business. In February 2003, Southern Power initiated a commercial paper program
to fund a portion of the construction costs of new generating facilities. The
amount of commercial paper initially represented about 45% of total debt, but is
forecasted to decline to less than 20% at year-end 2005. Southern Power's
strategy is to refinance most of such short-term borrowings with long-term
securities following commercial operation of the generating facilities. At
September 30, 2003, Southern Power had outstanding $102.7 million in commercial
paper. Reference is made to Note 7 to the financial statements of Southern Power
in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information relating to the commercial
paper program.

     To meet liquidity and capital resource requirements, Southern Power had at
September 30, 2003 approximately $650 million of unused committed credit
arrangements with banks expiring in 2006. This line also provides liquidity
support for Southern Power's commercial paper program (as discussed above).
Amounts drawn under the arrangements are used to finance acquisition and
construction costs related to gas-fired electric generating facilities and for
general corporate purposes, subject to borrowing limitations for each generating
facility. The arrangements permit Southern Power to fund construction of future
generating facilities upon meeting certain requirements. Financing of
construction at the McIntosh facility is subject to FERC approval of the related
PPAs. Reference is made to Note (Q) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding the FERC approval process for Southern Power's PPAs
with Georgia Power and Savannah Electric for Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11.
Southern Power also has access to loans from Southern Company to meet any
additional Plant McIntosh funding needs should other funding sources not be
adequate.

Credit Rating Risk

Southern Power does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade. There are certain physical electricity sale contracts and fixed-price
physical gas purchases that could require collateral -- but not accelerated
payment -- in the event of a credit rating change to below investment grade.
Generally, collateral may be provided for by a Southern Company guaranty, letter
of credit or cash. At September 30, 2003, the maximum potential collateral
requirements under the electricity sale contracts and financial instrument
agreements were approximately $159 million. At September 30, 2003, there were no

Exposure to Market Risks

Southern Power is exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates,
certain commodity prices and, occasionally, currency exchange rates. To manage
the volatility attributable to these exposures, Southern Power nets the exposure
to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative
transactions for the remaining exposure pursuant to approved risk management
policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Southern
Power's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging
purposes. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques that include
market valuation and sensitivity analysis.

     Southern Power has no outstanding variable rate long-term debt. To mitigate
Southern Power's exposure to interest rates, it entered into interest rate swaps
that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments

                             SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

arising from the 2003 planned issuance of senior notes. Changes in the fair
values of these swaps are deferred in Other Comprehensive Income. Upon the
issuance of the senior notes in July 2003, the swaps were settled at a loss of
approximately $93.3 million that is being amortized to expense over the
appropriate periods. Reference is made to Note (L) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for additional information. Based on Southern Power's overall
interest rate exposure at September 30, 2003, including derivatives and other
interest-rate sensitive instruments, a near-term 100 basis-point change in
interest rates would not materially affect Southern Power's financial
statements. In addition, Southern Power is not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Because energy from Southern Power's facilities is primarily sold under
long-term contracts with tolling agreements and provisions shifting
substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the PPA counterparties,
Southern Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and
prices of electricity is limited. To mitigate residual risks in those areas,
Southern Power enters into fixed-price contracts for the purchase or sale of
fuel and electricity. In connection with the transfers of Plant Franklin in 2001
and Plant Wansley in 2002 to Southern Power, Georgia Power transferred
approximately $5.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, in derivative assets
relating to electric and gas forward contracts in effect at the date of the
transfers. These contracts were recorded at fair value on the date of the
transfer, which was equal to Georgia Power's carrying amount. Following the
transfer, these contracts were marked to market through the Statement of Income
until realized and settled in August 2003.

     In prior years, to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate
for Euros, Southern Power entered into forward Euro purchase contracts
designated as fair value hedges of certain firm equipment purchase commitments
that required payment in Euros. As of May 2003, all Euro payments have been made
and the resulting gains associated with the hedges effectively reduced the
purchase price of the equipment, which is included in plant-in-service or
construction work in progress.

     Unrealized gains and losses on electric and gas contracts qualifying as
cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales are deferred in Other
Comprehensive Income. Unrealized gains and losses on contracts that do not
qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in the Statements of Income as
incurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, approximately
$1.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of losses were recognized in Other
Income in the Statements of Income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003
and 2002, approximately $1.2 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of losses
were recognized in Other Income in the Statements of Income. Realized gains and
losses on hedged transactions are recognized in revenues and/or fuel expense in
the Statements of Income as incurred. The fair values of derivative energy
contracts recognized on the balance sheet at September 30, 2003 were as follows:

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)      The condensed financial statements of the registrants included herein
         have been prepared by each registrant, without audit, pursuant
         to the rules and regulations of the SEC.  In the opinion of each
         registrant's management, the information regarding such registrant
         furnished herein reflects all adjustments necessary to present
         fairly the results of operations for the periods ended September 30,
         2003 and 2002.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
         included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
         accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have
         been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations,
         although each registrant believes that the disclosures regarding such
         registrant are adequate to make the information presented not
         misleading.  Disclosure which would substantially duplicate the
         disclosure in the Form 10-K and details which have not changed
         significantly in amount or composition since the filing of the
         Form 10-K are omitted from this Form 10-Q.  Therefore, these condensed
         financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial
         statements and the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K.
         Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
         current period presentation.  Due to seasonal variations in the
         demand for energy, operating results for the periods presented do not
         necessarily indicate operating results for the entire year.

(B)      Reference is made to Note 11 to the financial statements of Southern
         Company in Item 8 and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
         Earnings Potential - General" of Southern Company in Item 7 of the Form
         10-K for information on the spin-off of Mirant from Southern Company.

         On July 14, 2003, Mirant filed for voluntary reorganization under
         Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Southern Company has certain
         contingent liabilities associated with Mirant. Reference is made to
         Note 9 under "Guarantees" to the financial statements of Southern
         Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding Southern
         Company's guarantees of contractual commitments made by Mirant's
         subsidiaries. At September 30, 2003, the total notional amount of
         guarantees outstanding was less than $30 million.

         Reference is also made to Note (E) herein for information regarding
         various lawsuits related to Mirant and guarantees related to Mobile
         Energy. Reference is also made to Note 6 to the financial statements of
         Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding
         joint and several liability with Mirant in connection with the joint
         consolidated federal income tax return. As discussed in Note (C) below,
         the IRS has completed its audits of the consolidated federal income tax
         returns through 1999. Under the terms of the separation agreement,
         Mirant agreed to indemnify Southern Company for costs associated with
         these lawsuits, Mobile Energy guarantees and additional IRS
         assessments. The impact of Mirant's bankruptcy filing on Mirant's
         indemnity obligations, if any, cannot now be determined.  If Southern
         Company is ultimately required to make any payments related to these
         potential obligations, Mirant's indemnification obligation to
         Southern Company would represent an unsecured pre-bankruptcy claim,
         subject to compromise pursuant to Mirant's final reorganization
         plan.

                                      111

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         On April 30, 2003, Mirant filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
         year ended December 31, 2002. This filing included Mirant's restated
         financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.
         Mirant's restated net income for 2001 and 2000 decreased by $159
         million and $29 million, respectively. Mirant also announced that it is
         preparing revised quarterly financial statements for 2001 and expects
         to provide the quarterly results as soon as possible. Southern Company
         owned 100% of Mirant through September 2000 and 80% between October
         2000 and April 2, 2001. Due to Southern Company's spin-off of Mirant on
         April 2, 2001, Southern Company's financial statements reflect its
         share of Mirant's net income as discontinued operations. The effect of
         these restatements on Southern Company's financial statements, if any,
         cannot be determined until Mirant's 2001 revised quarterly financial
         statements are filed. The impact of the bankruptcy filing on the timing
         of filing 2001 revised quarterly financial statements, if any, cannot
         now be determined.

(C)      Reference is made to Note 1 under "Leveraged Leases" and Note 6 to the
         financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 and MANAGEMENT'S
         DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential - General" in Item
         7 of the Form 10-K.

         As a large corporate taxpayer, Southern Company undergoes audits by the
         IRS for each of its tax years. The IRS has completed its audits of
         Southern Company's consolidated federal income tax returns for all
         years through 1999. As part of the audit for the 1996-1999 tax years,
         the IRS reviewed Southern Company's four international leveraged lease
         transactions. Based on its review, the IRS proposed to disallow the tax
         losses associated with one of these transactions, resulting in an
         additional tax payment of approximately $30 million, including
         interest, to the IRS. To finalize the audit and eliminate any
         additional interest charges, Southern Company made this payment to the
         IRS in May 2003 and has filed a refund claim for this amount.
         Notwithstanding the position taken by the IRS, Southern Company
         continues to believe that the transaction remains a valid lease for
         U.S. tax purposes and, accordingly, will vigorously contest the
         proposed disallowance. Southern Company has accounted for the payment
         as a deposit. If Southern Company is not successful in its defense of
         the tax treatment for this transaction, it would also affect the timing
         of the related revenue recognition for book purposes. A cumulative
         effect adjustment would be required to reduce net income based on the
         revised cash flows as a result of the changes in the allowed tax
         deductions.

         The IRS did not disallow any tax losses or make any other adjustments
         for the 1996-1999 period with respect to any of Southern Company's
         other lease transactions. However, there can be no assurance that
         subsequent IRS audits would not raise similar disallowance issues.

         The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(D)    Southern Company has investments in two entities that produce synthetic
       fuel and receive tax credits. In April 2001, Southern Company acquired a
       30% membership interest in Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP). In 1998,
       Southern Company acquired a 24.975% limited partnership interest in
       Carbontronics Synfuels Investors, L.P. (Carbontronics). At September 30,
       2003, Southern Company's total investment in these entities was
       approximately $32 million.

       On June 30, 2003, the IRS issued an announcement that suspended the
       issuance of new private letter rulings and indicated that it might also
       revoke existing private letter rulings on tax credits for synthetic fuels
       pursuant to IRC Section 29 pending a review of the scientific validity of
       test procedures and results that have been presented as evidence that a
       significant chemical change occurred in such synthetic fuel. On October
       29, 2003, the IRS announced that it has completed its review and has
       determined that the test procedures and results used by taxpayers are
       scientifically valid if the procedures are applied in a consistent and
       unbiased manner. The IRS stated that the processes they approved do not
       produce the level of chemical change required by IRC Section 29, but they
       will, nevertheless, resume issuing private letter rulings. The IRS will
       require taxpayers applying for future rulings to implement and maintain
       certain sampling and quality control procedures, as well as additional
       documentation and record retention procedures. The IRS also plans to
       extend these procedures to taxpayers already holding rulings on the issue
       of significant chemical change.

       On October 30, 2003, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations
       announced that it has begun a separate investigation of the synthetic
       fuel industry and its producers for potential abuses of these tax
       credits.

       The IRS is currently auditing AFP for tax years 1999 and 2000 and, prior
       to the October announcement discussed above, had released an analysis
       report prepared by its chemical expert that challenges the existence of
       significant chemical change at AFP. The IRS is also currently auditing
       Carbontronics for tax years 2000 and 2001. From the inception of Southern
       Company's investment in these entities through September 30, 2003,
       Southern Company has recognized through income approximately $250 million
       (net of approximately $37 million reserved) in tax credits related to its
       share of the synthetic fuel production at these entities.

       Both entities have private letter rulings from the IRS that concluded
       significant chemical change occurred based on the procedures and results
       submitted. In addition, both entities regularly use independent
       laboratories and experts to test for chemical change. These tests
       replicated significant chemical changes consistent with the procedures
       submitted with the private letter rulings. Southern Company has relied on
       these private letter rulings and believes that the test results presented
       in connection with such private letter rulings are valid, and that the
       entities have operated in compliance with their respective private letter
       rulings and IRC Section 29. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot
       now be determined.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(E)      Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern
         Company, the operating companies and Southern Power in Item 8 and to
         "Legal Proceedings" in Item 3 of the Form 10-K for information relating
         to various lawsuits and other contingencies.

         MIRANT LITIGATION

         ERISA

         On April 17, 2003, a retired employee of Mirant filed a complaint in
         the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
         alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and
         naming as defendants Mirant, Southern Company, several current and
         former directors and officers of Mirant and/or Southern Company, and
         "Unknown Fiduciary Defendants 1-100." The plaintiff seeks to represent
         a purported class consisting of individuals who were participants in or
         beneficiaries of two Mirant employee benefit plans and their
         predecessor plans (the "Plans") at any time between January 1, 2000,
         and the filing of the complaint whose plan accounts included
         investments in Mirant common stock or the "Mirant Corporation Stock
         Fund." The complaint alleges that the defendants misled participants in
         the Plans by concealing Mirant's alleged "participation in the illegal
         manipulation of energy prices in California during 2000 and 2001 as
         well as other irregular and unlawful accounting manipulations tied to
         energy trading" and seeks unspecified monetary damages. On June 3,
         2003, a substantially similar complaint was filed in the United States
         District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Neither complaint
         contains any specific allegations of wrongdoing with respect to
         Southern Company. On September 2, 2003, the United States District
         Court for the Northern District of Georgia consolidated all pending and
         future ERISA actions arising out of the same facts, and the plaintiffs
         filed a consolidated amended ERISA complaint on September 23, 2003. The
         plaintiffs seek to represent a class of persons who were participants
         in or beneficiaries of certain Mirant Employee Savings Plans between
         September 27, 2000, and July 22, 2003. The consolidated amended
         complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties
         and violated ERISA by failing to investigate whether Mirant stock was a
         prudent investment for the plans, by continuing and promoting Mirant
         stock as an investment alternative for participants in the plans, and
         by failing to disclose information about Mirant's financial condition
         and about its improper activities in the California energy markets.
         Southern Company denies any wrongdoing and intends to defend this
         action.

         Securities

         Reference is made to Note 3 under "Mirant Securities Litigation" of
         Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. In this consolidated
         securities action, the remaining claims are based on alleged false
         statements and omissions in Mirant's prospectus for its initial public
         offering and accounting-related issues previously disclosed by Mirant.
         Such claims seek to impose liability on Southern Company based on
         allegations that Southern Company was a "control person" as to Mirant
         prior to the spin-off date. Southern Company filed an answer to the
         consolidated amended class action complaint on September 3, 2003, and
         discovery began on that date. Plaintiffs have also filed a motion for
         class certification. Under certain circumstances, Southern Company will
         be obligated under its Bylaws to indemnify the four current and/or
         former Southern Company officers who served as directors of Mirant at
         the time of its initial public offering through the date of the
         spin-off and are also named as defendants in this lawsuit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)

         Bankruptcy Impacts

         The Bankruptcy Code automatically stays all litigation as to Mirant. On
         September 23, 2003, a motion was filed with the bankruptcy court
         requesting an extension of this automatic stay to all other non-debtor
         defendants, including Southern Company and the named current and/or
         former Southern Company officers. On October 23, 2003, the bankruptcy
         court entered an order authorizing Southern Company's insurance
         companies to pay related defense costs. On November 5, 2003, the
         bankruptcy court granted the motion to extend the automatic stay, and
         the ERISA and Securities Litigation is therefore stayed until further
         order from the bankruptcy court.

         The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

         NEW SOURCE REVIEW ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS

         Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS --
         "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 and Note 3 to the financial
         statements of each registrant (except Southern Power) under "New Source
         Review Enforcement Actions" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. On August 8,
         2003, the EPA filed a petition for rehearing en banc with the U.S.
         Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ("Court of Appeals")
         regarding the Court of Appeals' June 24, 2003 order which held that the
         court did not have jurisdiction to decide the TVA appeal because the
         challenged Administrative Compliance order did not constitute final
         agency action. On September 16, 2003, the Court of Appeals denied the
         EPA's petition for rehearing. The EPA has ninety (90) days to petition
         the United States Supreme Court for certiorari review of the Court of
         Appeals' order. On September 23, 2003, the EPA and Alabama Power
         jointly notified the Alabama district court of the Court of Appeals'
         denial of the EPA's petition for rehearing en banc, and they jointly
         requested that the court keep that case stayed until the time for
         filing a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court
         expires. On October 6, 2003, the Alabama district court granted their
         request and continued the stay for an additional ninety (90) days. At
         this time, no party to the case in the federal district court in
         Atlanta, Georgia against Georgia Power and Savannah Electric, which was
         administratively closed two years ago, has asked the court to reopen
         that case. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

         Since the inception of the New Source Review proceedings against
         Georgia Power, Alabama Power and Savannah Electric, the EPA has also
         been proceeding with similar New Source Review enforcement actions
         against other utilities, involving many of the same legal issues.
         During the third quarter of 2003, district courts addressing these
         cases have issued opinions which reached conflicting conclusions.

         MOBILE ENERGY BANKRUPTCY PETITION

         Reference is made to Note 3 to the Southern Company financial
         statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. In July 2003, Mobile Energy
         received the necessary approval of its plan of reorganization under
         PUHCA. On September 23, 2003, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court confirmed the
         plan of reorganization. The plan of reorganization is expected to
         become effective before the end of 2003, and, pursuant to the plan,
         Southern Company's equity interest in Mobile Energy will be
         extinguished. The reorganization does not impact Southern Company's
         outstanding guarantees of certain potential obligations of Mobile
         Energy that represent a maximum contingent liability of $19 million at
         September 30, 2003. By their terms, these guarantees terminate in 2019
         and 2021. Under an obligation that is secured by a priority interest in
         Mobile Energy's assets, Mobile Energy agreed to indemnify Southern
         Company for any amounts that may be paid under these guarantees. The
         ultimate effect of the guarantees on Southern Company cannot now be
         determined.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         PLANT WANSLEY ENVIRONMENTAL LITIGATION

         Reference is made to Item 7 -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
         "Environmental Matters" of Georgia Power in the Form 10-K and to Note 3
         to the financial statements of Southern Company and Georgia Power under
         "Plant Wansley Litigation" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. On June 19,
         2003, the court granted Georgia Power's motion to dismiss the
         allegations regarding hazardous air pollutants and denied Georgia
         Power's motion to dismiss the allegations regarding emission offsets.
         Discovery is ongoing and no trial date has been set. The final outcome
         of this matter cannot now be determined.

         RACE DISCRIMINATION LITIGATION

         Reference is made to Note 3 under "Race Discrimination Litigation" of
         Southern Company and Georgia Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. On March
         31, 2003, the United States District Court for the Northern District of
         Georgia granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all
         claims raised by all of the seven named plaintiffs. On April 28, 2003,
         plaintiffs filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for
         the Eleventh Circuit challenging these adverse summary judgment
         rulings, as well as the District Court's October 2001 ruling denying
         class certification. In addition, plaintiffs appealed some adverse
         rulings on discovery issues. Both parties have filed their respective
         briefs with the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and they are
         awaiting the determination of the Court of Appeals. The final outcome
         of the case cannot now be determined.

         RIGHT OF WAY LITIGATION

         Reference is made to Note 3 under "Right of Way Litigation" of Southern
         Company, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah
         Electric in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. With respect to one lawsuit
         brought by landowners regarding the installation and use of fiber optic
         cable over Gulf Power rights of way located on the landowners'
         property, on November 7, 2003, the Second Circuit Court in Gadsden
         County Florida ruled in favor of the plaintiff's motion for partial
         summary judgment. The question of damages, if any, will be decided at a
         future trial. In the event of an adverse verdict on damages, Gulf Power
         could appeal the verdicts on both liability and damages. Management of
         Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe that the defendant
         companies in this and other similar litigation have complied with
         applicable laws. An adverse outcome in these matters could result in
         substantial judgments; however, the final outcome cannot now be
         determined.

(F)      Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern
         Company and Alabama Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information
         relating to Alabama Power's retail rate adjustment procedures.  In
         June 2003, Alabama Power began buying power under a seven-year PPA
         with Southern Power for 615 megawatts of capacity annually from
         Plant Harris.  In addition, Alabama Power also began buying power
         under a seven-year PPA with a third party for 630 megawatts; one-half
         of which became available in June 2003, with the remainder scheduled
         to be available beginning in June 2004.  Both PPAs have been
         certificated by the Alabama PSC.  As a result, Alabama Power's
         retail rates were adjusted beginning July 2003 by approximately 2.6%
         under Rate CNP (Certificated New Plant), which allows Alabama Power
         to recover costs associated with certificated new plants including
         PPAs.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(G)      In May 2003, Georgia Power filed for a fuel cost recovery rate
         increase. On August 19, 2003, the Georgia PSC issued an order approving
         a stipulation reached by Georgia Power, the Consumers' Utility Counsel
         Division, Georgia Textile Manufacturers Association, Georgia Industrial
         Group and the Staff of the Georgia PSC. The stipulation allows Georgia
         Power to increase customer fuel rates to recover existing
         under-recovered deferred fuel costs over the period of October 1, 2003
         through March 31, 2005, as well as future projected fuel costs. The new
         fuel rate represents an average annual increase in rates paid by
         customers of approximately 1.6%.

(H)      Reference is made to Note 1 under "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities"
         to the financial statements of Southern Company and each of the
         operating companies in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. The operating companies
         are subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for
         the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a
         portion of a company's operations is no longer subject to these
         provisions, the company would be required to write off related
         regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
         and determine if any other assets have been impaired.

(I)      Reference is made to Note 9, Note 4 and Note 4 under "Guarantees" to
         the financial statements of Southern Company, Georgia Power and Gulf
         Power, respectively, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information
         regarding guarantees of loans to residential customers for heat pump
         purchases. As of September 30, 2003, the total outstanding loans
         guaranteed by all of the operating companies was $12.6 million, of
         which Georgia Power is responsible for $10.2 million and Gulf Power is
         responsible for $0.7 million. Total loan loss reserves of $3.2 million
         ($2.1 million for Georgia Power and $0.2 million for Gulf Power) have
         been recorded.

         In addition, further reference is made to Note 4 for Alabama Power and
         Georgia Power relating to certain obligations incurred in connection
         with outstanding debt of SEGCO. In May 2003, SEGCO issued an additional
         $50 million in senior notes. Alabama Power guaranteed the debt
         obligation and in October 2003, Georgia Power agreed to reimburse
         Alabama Power for the pro rata portion of such obligation corresponding
         to its then proportionate ownership of stock of SEGCO if Alabama Power
         is called upon to make such payment under its guaranty.

(J)      Effective January 1, 2003, Southern Company adopted FASB Statement
         No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations."  Statement
         No. 143 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
         obligations associated with the ultimate costs of retiring long-lived
         assets.  The ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be
         recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred.  The costs
         must be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
         depreciated over the asset's useful life.  Additionally, Statement No.
         143 does not permit the continued accrual of future retirement costs
         for long-lived assets which the company does not have a legal
         obligation to retire.  However, the operating companies have discussed
         the financial statement impacts of Statement No. 143 with their
         respective PSCs and will continue to recognize the accumulated removal
         costs for other obligations as part of accumulated depreciation.  As
         of September 30, 2003, amounts recorded in Accumulated Depreciation
         that represent regulatory liabilities related to such removal
         costs totaled $1.3 billion, consisting of $571 million, $418 million,
         $149 million, $78 million and $36 million for Alabama Power, Georgia
         Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah Electric,
         respectively.

         The operating companies had no cumulative effect to net income
         resulting from the adoption of Statement No. 143. As a result, Alabama
         Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah
         Electric recorded regulatory assets (liabilities) of $(71) million, $21
         million, $0.9 million, $0.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively, as
         of January 1, 2003. The regulatory liability for Alabama Power is
         reflected in the balance sheets under "Asset retirement obligation
         regulatory liability." The regulatory assets of the other operating

                                      117

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         companies are reflected in the balance sheets under either "Asset
         retirement obligation regulatory asset" or in "Other" under
         "Deferred Charges and Other Assets."  Southern Power recorded a
         cumulative effect adjustment to income upon adoption of
         $0.6 million ($0.4 million after taxes), representing
         removal costs previously accrued.

         The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates
         to Southern Company's nuclear facilities, which include Alabama Power's
         Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plants Hatch
         and Vogtle. The fair value of assets legally restricted for settling
         retirement obligations related to these assets as of September 30, 2003
         is $345 million, $394 million and $739 million for Alabama Power,
         Georgia Power and Southern Company, respectively. In addition, the
         operating companies have retirement obligations related to various
         landfill sites, ash ponds and underground storage tanks. The operating
         companies have also identified retirement obligations related to
         certain transmission and distribution facilities. However, liabilities
         for the removal of these transmission and distribution assets will not
         be recorded because no reasonable estimate can be made regarding the
         timing of the obligations. The operating companies will continue to
         recognize in the income statement their ultimate removal costs in
         accordance with each company's respective regulatory treatment. Any
         difference between costs recognized under Statement No. 143 and those
         reflected in rates will be recognized as either a regulatory asset or
         liability.

         Alabama Power has revised the estimated cost to retire Plant Farley as
         a result of a new site-specific decommissioning study completed in
         April 2003. The effect of the revision is an increase of $34.5 million
         for the Statement No. 143 liability included in "Asset Retirement
         Obligations" with a corresponding increase in property, plant and
         equipment. Based on the new study, the estimated site study
         decommissioning costs are $955 million ($892 million for radiated
         structures plus $63 million for non-radiated structures) and the
         ultimate decommissioning costs are $2,529 million ($2,349 million for
         radiated structures plus $180 million for non-radiated structures). In
         September 2003, Alabama Power filed an application with the NRC to
         extend the operating license for Plant Farley for 20 additional years.
         For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements of
         Alabama Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

         Georgia Power expects to complete new site-specific decommissioning
         studies for Plants Hatch and Vogtle prior to December 31, 2003.

         Obligations included in the balance sheets.

         The adoption of FASB Statement No. 143 has been treated as a non-cash
         transaction for purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows.

(K)      Reference is made to Note 1 under "Stock Options" and Note 7 under
         "Stock Option Plan" to the financial statements of Southern Company in
         Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding non-qualified
         employee stock options provided by Southern Company.  Southern Company
         accounts for options granted in accordance with Accounting Principles
         Board Opinion No. 25; thus, no compensation expense is recognized
         because the exercise price of all options granted equaled the fair
         market value on the date of the grant.  The estimated fair values
         of stock options granted during the three-month and nine-month periods
         ending September 30, 2003 and 2002 have been derived using the
         Black-Scholes stock option pricing model.  The following table shows
         the assumptions and the weighted average fair values of these stock

(L)      In addition to the fixed price electric and gas contracts used to
         mitigate exposure to volatile energy prices (see "Exposure to Market
         Risks" in MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS herein), Southern
         Company and certain of its subsidiaries enter into interest rate swaps
         and treasury rate locks (together "derivatives") to hedge
         exposure to interest rate changes.  Derivatives related to fixed rate
         securities are accounted for as fair value hedges; derivatives
         related to variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are
         accounted for as cash flow hedges.  The derivatives are generally
         structured to mirror the terms of the hedged debt instruments;
         therefore, no material ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings.
         As of September 30, 2003, the following swaps were outstanding:

         In July 2003, Southern Power completed the issuance of $575 million of
         4.875% senior notes due July 15, 2015. In connection with the issuance
         of these notes, Southern Power settled $500 million of interest rate
         swaps and incurred a loss of $93.3 million which is reflected in Other
         Comprehensive Income.

         Also in July 2003, Gulf Power completed the issuance of $60 million of
         4.35% senior notes due July 15, 2013. In connection with the issuance

(M)      In October 2003, the FERC approved a new Open Access Transmission
         Tariff for the operating companies of $1.73 per kilowatt-month based
         on an 11.25% return on equity.  The operating companies had requested
         a rate increase effective January 2002 based on a 13% return on
         equity. Pending FERC approval, the operating companies collected the
         new rate based on the 13% return on equity, but recorded revenue
         subject to refund for amounts above the previously approved rate of
         $1.37 per kilowatt-month.  As of September 30, 2003, revenue subject to
         refund totaled approximately $22.2 million ($10 million, $9.5 million,
         $1 million, $1.5 million, and $0.2 million for Alabama Power, Georgia
         Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric,
         respectively).  As a result of the final settlement, a total of
         approximately $5.4 million was refunded to the operating company
         transmission customers in October 2003.  The remaining $16.7 million
         was recorded as revenue ($7.6 million, $7.2 million, $0.7 million,
         $1.1 million, and $0.1 million for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf
         Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah Electric, respectively).

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         On May 21, 2003, Mississippi Power and Southern Power entered into
         agreements with Dynegy (the "Agreements") to resolve all outstanding
         matters related to Dynegy, the PPAs and the related letters of credit.
         Under the terms of the Agreements, (1) Dynegy made a cash payment of
         $75 million to Mississippi Power and $80 million to Southern Power; (2)
         the PPAs between Southern Power and Dynegy were terminated, with no
         party having any remaining obligations under such PPAs thereafter; (3)
         Dynegy and Mississippi Power amended their PPA so that no capacity
         payments are due from Dynegy to Mississippi Power for capacity made
         available under the PPA from June 2003 through October 2003 (but other
         obligations and payments by Dynegy under such PPA are not affected
         during such time) and the PPA terminated effective October 31, 2003,
         with neither party having any remaining obligations under the PPA after
         October 31, 2003; (4) Dynegy paid all amounts for which it was
         obligated under the PPAs up to their time of cancellation or amendment;
         (5) Southern Power and Mississippi Power returned the existing letters
         of credit in support of Dynegy's obligations under the PPAs; and (6)
         Dynegy deposited $7 million with Mississippi Power as collateral for
         Dynegy's potential energy purchases under the PPA through October 31,
         2003.

         The termination payments from Dynegy resulted in a one-time gain to
         Southern Company of approximately $88 million after tax ($38 million
         for Mississippi Power and $50 million for Southern Power).

         Because of the terminations of the PPAs, Southern Power is completing
         limited construction activities on Plant Franklin Unit 3 to preserve
         the long-term viability of the project. Current projections indicate
         completion in the 2008-2011 period. The length of the deferral period
         will depend on forecasted capacity needs and other wholesale market
         opportunities. Mississippi Power and Southern Power are also continuing
         to explore alternatives for their existing capacity. The final outcome
         of these matters cannot now be determined.

         After giving effect to the termination of these PPAs, total expected
         capacity payments from non-affiliates are as follows (in millions):

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(P)      Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements under
         "Construction Program" of Southern Power and to Note 4 to the financial
         statements under "Construction Program" of Georgia Power in Item 8 of
         the Form 10-K for information regarding Southern Company keep-wells
         covering the transfer of specific vendor contracts from Georgia Power
         to Southern Power for the operation of Plant Dahlberg and construction
         at the Plant Franklin and Plant Stanton sites. Southern Power completed
         its purchase obligations under these contracts during the first quarter
         2003.

(Q)      Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
         Earnings Potential - General" in Item 7 and Note 4 under "Purchased
         Power Commitments" and "Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments" to the
         financial statements of Georgia Power and Savannah Electric,
         respectively, and Note 5 to the financial statements of Southern Power
         in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding PPAs between
         Southern Power and Georgia Power and Savannah Electric for Plant
         McIntosh capacity. Such PPAs were certified by the Georgia PSC in
         December 2002 after a competitive bidding process.

         The Electric Power Supply Association and Calpine Corporation have made
         filings in this proceeding in opposition to the FERC's acceptance of
         the PPAs, alleging that the PPAs do not meet the applicable standards
         for PPAs between affiliates. In April 2003, Southern Power applied for
         FERC approval of these PPAs. In July 2003, the FERC accepted the PPAs
         to become effective June 1, 2005, subject to refund, and ordered that
         hearings be held to determine: (a) whether, in the design and
         implementation of the Georgia PSC competitive bidding process, Georgia
         Power and Savannah Electric unduly preferred Southern Power; (b)
         whether the analysis of the competitive bids unduly favored Southern
         Power, particularly with respect to evaluation of non-price factors;
         (c) whether Georgia Power and Savannah Electric selected their
         affiliate, Southern Power, based upon a reasonable combination of price
         and non-price factors; (d) whether Southern Power received an undue
         preference or competitive advantage in the competitive bidding process
         as a result of access to its affiliate's transmission system; (e)
         whether and to what extent the PPAs impact wholesale competition; and
         (f) whether the PPAs are just and reasonable and not unduly
         discriminatory. Hearings are scheduled to commence on March 1, 2004.
         Management believes that the PPAs should be approved by the FERC;
         however, the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

         In March 2003, Savannah Electric transferred to Southern Power 58 acres
         of land to facilitate construction at Plant McIntosh. The transfer was
         made at Savannah Electric's book value of approximately $16,500 in
         accordance with PUHCA and the related SEC order (Release No. 35-27322)
         dated December 27, 2000, which authorized the formation of Southern
         Power and the transfer of assets thereto. On July 17, 2003, the Georgia
         PSC issued an order requiring that Savannah Electric record the
         transfer of this land at the higher of net book value or fair market
         value based on an appraisal by an appraiser selected by the Georgia PSC
         staff. Based on an appraisal completed in September 2003, the fair
         market value of the land has been established at $320,000 and this
         matter has been concluded.

(R)      Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
         Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" in Item 7 and Note 3 under
         "Transmission Facilities Agreement" to the financial statements of
         Mississippi Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding
         the FERC's investigation related to a transmission facilities agreement
         with Entergy Corporation. On July 9, 2003, the FERC approved a
         settlement between Mississippi Power and the FERC Staff. The impact of
         the settlement provides for no refund of prior revenues collected and a
         minimal change in revenues for 2004 forward.

(S)      Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
         "Accounting Policies - Critical Policies" and "Financial Condition -
         Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements" of Mississippi Power and
         "Financial Condition - Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements" of
         Southern Company in Item 7 and Note 8 under "Lease Agreements" and
         Note 9 under "Operating Leases" to the financial statements of
         Mississippi Power and Southern Company, respectively, in Item 8 of
         the Form 10-K for information regarding Mississippi Power's lease of
         two generating units totaling 1,064 megawatts at Plant Daniel from
         Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership ("Escatawpa"), which
         began in 2001.  Escatawpa raised a total of approximately $370
         million to finance these generating units. Escatawpa was not
         consolidated by Mississippi Power pursuant to accounting guidance
         then in effect. On June 27, 2003, the generating units owned by
         Escatawpa and the related debt were acquired by Juniper Capital L.P.
         ("Juniper"), a limited partnership unaffiliated with Mississippi
         Power.  Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease
         agreement with Mississippi Power. Juniper has also entered into
         leases with third parties unrelated to Mississippi Power.  The assets
         leased by Mississippi Power comprise less than half of Juniper's
         assets. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46, Mississippi
         Power is not required to consolidate the leased assets and related
         liabilities.  Furthermore, the new lease agreement is an operating
         lease under FASB Statement No. 13.  Principal terms of the Juniper
         lease remain essentially the same as those in the Escatawpa
         lease.  The initial lease term ends in 2011.  Like the Escatawpa
         lease, the Juniper lease also includes a purchase and renewal option
         based on the cost of the facility, which was $368.7 million at the
         inception of the Juniper lease. Mississippi Power is required to
         amortize approximately 4% of the initial acquisition cost over
         the initial lease term, which is less than the 10% provided for under
         the Escatawpa lease.  Eighteen months prior to the end of the initial
         lease, Mississippi Power may elect to renew for 10 years.  If
         Mississippi Power elects to renew the lease, the agreement calls for
         Mississippi Power to amortize an additional 17% of the initial
         completion cost over the renewal period.  Upon termination of the
         lease, at Mississippi Power's option, it may either exercise its
         purchase option or the facility can be sold to a third party.

         For each of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2002,
         Mississippi Power recognized approximately $19.3 million and $19
         million, respectively, in lease expenses, including approximately $2.2
         million in each year related to the amortization of the initial
         acquisition cost. In addition, $10.6 million in lease termination costs
         were included in other operation expenses in the second quarter of
         2003.

         The Juniper lease provides for a residual value guarantee
         (approximately 73% of the acquisition cost) by Mississippi Power that
         is due upon termination of the lease in the event that Mississippi
         Power does not renew the lease or purchase the assets and the fair
         market value is less than the unamortized cost of the asset. In
         accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45, Mississippi Power has
         recognized a liability of approximately $15.2 million for the fair
         market value of this residual value guarantee in the accompanying
         balance sheet.

                             SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE
                                SOUTHERN COMPANY
                              EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN


         WHEREAS, Southern Company Services, Inc. ("Company") adopted the latest
amendment and restatement of The Southern Company Employee Savings Plan
("Plan"), effective as of January 1, 2002;

         WHEREAS, the Employee Savings Plan Committee ("Committee") desires to
amend the Plan to incorporate "catch-up" contributions under Internal Revenue
Code Section 414(v);

         WHEREAS, the Committee is authorized pursuant to Section 15.1 of the
Plan to amend the Plan at any time, provided that the amendment does not involve
a substantial increase in cost to any Employing Company or is necessary or
desirable to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to the Plan.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the Committee hereby amends the Plan as follows,
effective as of the first paycheck issued on or after October 1, 2002:

                                       1.

         Article IV of the Plan, "Elective Employer Contributions and Voluntary

to the end:

                  4.12 Catch-Up Contributions. All Eligible Participants who
          will have attained age fifty (50) before the close of the Plan Year
          shall be eligible to make catch-up contributions in accordance with,

          provisions of the Plan implementing the required limitations of Code
          Sections 402(g) and 415. The Plan shall not be treated as failing to
          satisfy the provisions of the Plan implementing the requirements of
          Code Section 401(k)(3), 401(k)(11), 401(k)(12), 410(b) , or 416, as
          applicable, by reason of the making of such catch-up contributions.
          Catch-up contributions shall be made in such dollar amounts as elected
          by the Participant.

                                       2.

         Except as amended herein by this Second Amendment, the Plan shall
remain in full force and effect.

                             THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE
                                SOUTHERN COMPANY
                              EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN


         WHEREAS, Southern Company Services, Inc. ("Company") adopted the latest
amendment and restatement of The Southern Company Employee Savings Plan
("Plan"), effective as of January 1, 2002;

         WHEREAS, in connection with filing the Plan for a favorable
determination letter with the Internal Revenue Service, the Internal Revenue
Service has requested that certain technical changes be made to the Plan;

         WHEREAS, the Committee is authorized pursuant to Section 15.1 of the
Plan to amend the Plan at any time, provided that the amendment does not involve
a substantial increase in cost to any Employing Company or is necessary or
desirable to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to the Plan.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the Committee hereby amends the Plan as follows,
effective as of January 1, 2002:

1.

         Section 2.3 is amended to read as follows:

                  2.3 "Actual Deferral Percentage" shall mean the ratio
         (expressed as a percentage) of Elective Employer Contributions on
         behalf of an Eligible Participant for the Plan Year to the Eligible
         Participant's compensation for the Plan Year. For the purpose of
         determining an Eligible Participant's Actual Deferral Percentage for a
         Plan Year, the Committee may elect to consider an Eligible
         Participant's compensation for (a) the entire Plan Year or (b) that
         portion of the Plan Year in which the Eligible Participant was eligible
         to have Elective Employer Contributions made on his behalf, provided
         that such election is applied uniformly to all Eligible Participants
         for the Plan Year. For purposes of this Section 2.3, "compensation"
         shall mean actual compensation for services rendered or paid by the
         Employer to an Eligible Participant which is currently includible in
         the Eligible Participant's gross income, as reported on the Eligible
         Participant's Federal Income Tax Withholding Statement (Form W-2), plus
         (i) an Eligible Participant's elective deferrals under Code Section
         402(g)(3), (ii) amounts contributed or deferred under Code Section 125
         by the Employer at the Eligible Participant's election that are not
         includable in the Eligible Participant's gross income, and (iii)
         amounts which are not includable in an Eligible Participant's gross
         income by reason of Code Sections 132(f)(4) or 457. Compensation also
         shall be limited pursuant to Code Section 401(a)(17). The Actual
         Deferral Percentage of an Eligible Participant who does not have
         Elective Employer Contributions made on his behalf shall be zero.

<PAGE>

                                       2.

         Section 2.19 is amended to read as follows:

                  2.19 "Contribution Percentage shall mean the ratio (expressed
         as a percentage), of the sum of the Voluntary Participant Contributions
         and Employer Matching Contributions under the Plan on behalf of the
         Eligible Participant for the Plan Year to the Eligible Participant's
         compensation for the Plan Year. For the purpose of determining an
         Eligible Participant's Contribution Percentage for a Plan Year, the
         Committee may elect to consider an Eligible Participant's compensation
         for (a) the entire Plan Year or (b) that portion of the Plan Year in
         which the individual is an Eligible Participant, provided that such
         election is applied uniformly to all Eligible Participants for the Plan
         Year. For purposes of this Section 2.19, "compensation" shall mean
         actual compensation for services rendered or paid by the Employer to an
         Eligible Participant which is currently includible in the Eligible
         Participant's gross income, as reported on the Eligible Participant's
         Federal Income Tax Withholding Statement (Form W-2), plus (i) an
         Eligible Participant's elective deferrals under Code Section 402(g)(3),
         (ii) amounts contributed or deferred under Code Section 125 by the
         Employer at the Eligible Participant's election that are not includable
         in the Eligible Participant's gross income, and (iii) amounts which are
         not includable in an Eligible Participant's gross income by reason of
         Code Sections 132(f)(4) or 457. Compensation also shall be limited
         pursuant to Code Section 401(a)(17). The Contribution Percentage of an
         Eligible Participant who does not make Voluntary Participant
         Contributions or have Employer Matching Contributions made on his
         behalf shall be zero.

                                       3.

         Section 2.37 is amended to read as follows:

                  2.37 "Highly Compensated Employee" shall mean (in accordance
          with and subject to Code Section 414(q) and any regulations, rulings,
          notices or procedures thereunder), with respect to any Plan Year: (1)
          any Employee who was a five percent (5%) owner of The Southern Company
          or an Affiliated Employer (as determined pursuant to Code Section 416)
          during the Plan Year or the immediately preceding Plan Year, or (2)
          any Employee who had compensation in excess of $80,000 in the
          preceding Plan Year. The $80,000 amount shall be adjusted for
          inflation and for short Plan Years, pursuant to Code Section 414(q).
          The Employer may, at its election, limit Employees who had
          compensation in excess of $80,000 to only those Employees who fall
          within the "top-paid group," as defined in Code Section 414(q)
          excluding those employees described in Code Section 414(q)(8) for such
          purpose. In determining whether an Employee is a Highly Compensated
          Employee, the Committee may make any elections authorized under
          applicable regulations, rulings, notices, or revenue procedures. For
          purposes of this Section 2.37, "compensation" shall mean compensation
          within the meaning of Code Section 415(c)(3).

                                       4.

401(a)(4) or Section 410" with "Section 401(a)(4) and Section 410".

5.

         A new paragraph (e) is added to the end of Section 16.3, to read as
follows:

                  (e) For all top-heavy purposes other than the determination of
         whether an Employee is a Key Employee, "compensation" shall mean all
         payments by the Employer to an Eligible Participant included as wages
         within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of
         compensation to an Eligible Participant by the Employer (in the course
         of the Employer's trade or business) for which the Employer is required
         to furnish the Eligible Participant a written statement under Code
         Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052. Compensation for this purpose
         shall be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section
         3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the
         nature or location of the Eligible Participant or the services
         performed. Compensation shall also include (i) an Eligible
         Participant's elective deferrals under Code Section 402(g)(3), (ii)
         amounts contributed or deferred under Code Section 125 by the Employer
         at the Eligible Participant's election that are not includable in the

         includable in an Eligible Participant's gross income by reason of Code
         Sections 132(f)(4) or 457. Compensation also shall be limited pursuant
         to Code Section 401(a)(17).

                                       6.

         Except as amended herein by this Third Amendment, the Plan shall remain

         WHEREAS, Southern Company Services, Inc. ("Company") adopted the latest

("Plan"), effective as of January 1, 2002;

         WHEREAS, the Committee desires to increase the Elective Employer

         WHEREAS, the Committee desires to revise the distribution provisions
for alternate payees under qualified domestic relations orders;

         WHEREAS, the Committee is authorized pursuant to Section 15.1 of the

                                       1.

         Section 4.1, "Elective Employer Contributions," is deleted in its
entirety and replaced with the following new Section 4.1, effective as of April
1, 2003:

                  4.1 Elective Employer Contributions. Subject to the combined
          limitation on Elective Employer Contributions and Voluntary
          Participant Contributions under Section 4.6, an Eligible Employee who
          meets the participation requirements of Article III may elect in
          accordance with the procedures established by the Committee to have
          his Compensation reduced by a whole percentage of his Compensation,
          which percentage shall not be less than one percent (1%) nor more than
          twenty-five percent (25%) of his Compensation, except to the extent
          permitted under Section 4.12 of the Plan and Code Section 414(v), such
          Elective Employer contribution to be contributed to his Account under
          the Plan.

                                       2.

         The last sentence of Section 4.6, "Voluntary Participant

<PAGE>

          provided that the sum of his Elective Employer Contributions and
          Voluntary Participant Contributions shall not exceed twenty-five
          percent (25%) of his Compensation. The forgoing limitation for Highly

          first identified by the Employing Company as a Highly Compensated
          Employee.

                                       3.

          order which (a) is a qualified domestic relations order satisfying the
          requirements of Section 414(p) of the Code and (b) requires the
          immediate distribution in a single lump sum of the entire portion of
          the Participant's Account required to be segregated for the benefit of
          an alternate payee, then the entire interest of such alternate payee
          shall be distributed in a single lump sum within ninety (90) days
          following the Employing Company's notification to the Participant and
          the alternate payee that the domestic relations order is qualified
          under Section 414(p) of the Code, or as soon as practicable
          thereafter. Such distribution to an alternate payee shall be made even
          if the Participant has not separated from the service of the
          Affiliated Employers. Any other distribution pursuant to a qualified
          domestic relations order shall not be made earlier than the
          Participant's separation from service, or his attainment of age fifty
          (50), if earlier. Such distribution to an alternate payee shall be

                              EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN

         WHEREAS, Southern Company Services, Inc. ("Company") adopted the latest
amendment and restatement of The Southern Company Employee Savings Plan
("Plan"), effective as of January 1, 2002;

         WHEREAS, the Committee desires to amend the Plan to allow the Committee
to take such actions as it deems necessary or appropriate to administer the Plan
during any period in which trading of one or more investments has been suspended
or discontinued for any reason;

         WHEREAS, the Committee is authorized pursuant to Section 15.1 of the
Plan to amend the Plan at any time, provided that the amendment does not involve
a substantial increase in cost to the Employing Company or is necessary or
desirable to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to the Plan.

          However, in no event shall the foregoing give the Committee discretion
          or control over the investment of Plan assets.

                                       2.

                                SOUTHERN COMPANY
                          EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN


         WHEREAS, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan Committee ("Committee")
heretofore adopted the amendment and restatement of The Southern Company
Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("Plan"), effective as of January 1, 2002;

determination letter with the Internal Revenue Service, the Internal Revenue
Service has requested that certain technical changes be made to the Plan;

         WHEREAS, the Committee is authorized pursuant to Section 11.1 of the
Plan to amend the Plan at any time, provided that the amendment does not involve
a substantial increase in cost to any Employing Company or is necessary or
desirable to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to the Plan.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the Committee hereby amends the Plan as follows,
effective as of January 1, 2002:

                                       1.

         Section 2.25 is amended to read as follows:

                  2.25 "Highly Compensated Employee" shall mean (in accordance
          with and subject to Code Section 414(q) and any regulations, rulings,
          notices or procedures thereunder), with respect to any Plan Year: (1)
          any Employee who was a five percent (5%) owner of The Southern Company
          or an Affiliated Employer (as determined pursuant to Code Section 416)
          during the Plan Year or the immediately preceding Plan Year, or (2)
          any Employee who had compensation in excess of $80,000 in the
          preceding Plan Year. The $80,000 amount shall be adjusted for
          inflation and for short Plan Years, pursuant to Code Section 414(q).
          The Employer may, at its election, limit Employees who had
          compensation in excess of $80,000 to only those Employees who fall
          within the "top-paid group," as defined in Code Section 414(q)
          excluding those employees described in Code Section 414(q)(8) for such
          purpose. In determining whether an Employee is a Highly Compensated
          Employee, the Committee may make any elections authorized under
          applicable regulations, rulings, notices, or revenue procedures. For
          purposes of this Section 2.25, "compensation" shall mean compensation
          within the meaning of Code Section 415(c)(3).



<PAGE>



                                       2.

         Section 2.37 is amended by replacing the reference to "Section
401(a)(4) or Section 410" with "Section 401(a)(4) and Section 410".

         A new paragraph (e) is added to the end of Section 12.3, to read as
follows:

                  (e) For all top-heavy purposes other than the determination of

         payments by the Employer to a Participant included as wages within the
         meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation
         to a Participant by the Employer (in the course of the Employer's trade
         or business) for which the Employer is required to furnish the
         Participant a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3)
         and 6052. Compensation for this purpose shall be determined without
         regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the
         remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the
         Participant or the services performed. Compensation shall also include
         (i) a Participant's elective deferrals under Code Section 402(g)(3),
         (ii) amounts contributed or deferred under Code Section 125 by the
         Employer at the Participant's election that are not includable in the

         401(a)(17).

                                       4.

                  8.12 Distributions to Alternate Payees. If the Participant's
         Account under the Plan shall become subject to any domestic relations
         order which (a) is a qualified domestic relations order satisfying the
         requirements of Section 414(p) of the Code and (b) requires the
         immediate distribution in a single lump sum of the entire portion of
         the Participant's Account required to be segregated for the benefit of
         an alternate payee, then the entire interest of such alternate payee

         Employers. Any other distribution pursuant to a qualified domestic
         relations order shall not be made earlier than the Participant's

         distribution to an alternate payee shall be made only in a manner
         permitted under Section 8.7 of the Plan and only to the extent the
         Participant would be eligible for such distribution option had the
         Participant retired or otherwise separated from the service of the
         Affiliated Employers.

         as amended, with respect to equity securities of The Southern Company
         shall not be permitted to amend his distribution election during any
         time period for which such Participant is required to file any such
         reports with respect to his Non-Pension Benefit unless such amendment
         is specifically approved by the Administrative Committee in its sole
         discretion. Each Participant, his Beneficiary, and legal representative
         shall be bound as to any action taken pursuant to the method of
         distribution elected by a Participant and the terms of the Plan.
         Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, if a
         Participant has elected to receive his Plan distribution in annual
         installment payments and such Participant's Plan Account does not
         exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) (as adjusted from time to time by
         Treasury regulations applicable to tax-qualified retirement plans) at
         the time such benefit is valued for distribution, such payment shall be
         made as a single, lump-sum payment to the Participant.

                                       2.

         Except as amended herein by this First Amendment, the Plan shall remain
in full force and effect as adopted and amended by the Company prior to the
adoption of this First Amendment.

         RESOLVED FURTHER, that the appropriate officers of the Company be, and
each of them hereby is, authorized and directed to take all actions necessary or
desirable to carry the foregoing resolution into full force and effect with
respect to the Plan, including, but not limited to, executing and delivering all
instruments with respect to the Plan.


         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this First Amendment is hereby adopted by the
Administrative Committee this _____ day of , 2002. ------------

                  Except as amended herein, by this First Amendment, the Plan
         shall remain in full force and effect as amended and restated by the
         Company.

<DESCRIPTION>AMENDED AND RESTATED SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION AGREEMENT
<TEXT>

                                                                 Exhibit 10(a)5

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED

                         SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION AGREEMENT


         THIS AGREEMENT, made and entered into this _____ day of
_______________, 2003, by and between GEORGIA POWER COMPANY ("GPC"), SOUTHERN
COMPANY ("Southern"), SOUTHERN COMPANY SERVICES, INC. ("SCS") (GPC, Southern and
SCS are each referred to herein individually as "Company" and collectively as
"Companies"), and C.B. HARRELD ("Harreld").


                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, Harreld's formal employment by GPC began on July 6, 1982;
however, his valuable services to GPC actually commenced at a considerably
earlier date with his employment on August 6, 1966 as an accountant with Arthur
Andersen & Company; and

         WHEREAS, the knowledge of the affairs and business of GPC and Southern
acquired by Harreld while in this capacity as an accountant has proven of great
value to GPC and Southern in the years since his formal employment, and will, in
the opinion of GPC and SCS, continue to do so in the future; and

         WHEREAS, GPC and Harreld entered into an agreement as of July 29, 1994,
for the provision of certain supplemental retirement benefits ("GPC Agreement");
and

         WHEREAS, the GPC Agreement was amended and restated as of May 20, 1996
in order to recognize Harreld's transfer to Mirant Services LLC (formerly,
Southern Electric International, Inc.) ("Mirant Services") on September 9, 1995
and to provide for Mirant Services' payment of its proportionate share of the
supplemental retirement benefits previously agreed to be paid to Harreld by GPC
in addition to any supplemental retirement benefits to which Harreld may be
entitled to receive as an employee of Mirant Services ("Mirant Agreement"); and

         WHEREAS, the Mirant Agreement was amended and restated as of September
4, 2001 in order to recognize Harreld's transfer to SCS on February 17, 2001 and
Southern's assumption of liability for Mirant Services' proportionate share of
supplemental retirement benefits under the Mirant Agreement as a result of the
spinoff of Mirant Corporation (formerly Southern Energy, Inc.) from Southern on
April 2, 2001 and to provide for the payment by SCS and Southern of their
proportionate shares of the benefits ("SCS Agreement"); and

         WHEREAS, Harreld transferred from SCS back to GPC on June 21, 2003, and
SCS, Southern and GPC desire to amend and restate the SCS Agreement to reflect
such transfer.

                                       2

<PAGE>

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
covenants herein contained, the SCS Agreement is hereby amended and restated as
follows:

1. If Harreld shall continue to serve GPC faithfully, diligently and competently
to the best of his ability from the date of this Agreement until either:

(a) such date after his service as an employee shall terminate; or

(b) his retirement in accordance with the provisions of The Southern Company
Pension Plan ("Pension Plan"); or

(c) his death while in the service of GPC, if his spouse is entitled to benefits
as a Provisional Payee under the Pension Plan;

then the provisions of Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Agreement shall be operative.

         2. GPC, SCS and Southern shall pay to Harreld commencing on his
retirement date under the Pension Plan, if he shall retire in accordance with
the provisions of the Pension Plan, and thereafter on the first day of each
succeeding month during the lifetime of Harreld, an amount per month equal to
the difference between the monthly amount payable to Harreld under the Pension
Plan as it shall then be in effect at the time any monthly amount shall be
payable in accordance with this Paragraph and the monthly amount which would
have been payable to him under the Pension Plan if Harreld were given credit for
ten additional years of Accredited Service under the Pension Plan in recognition
of his time spent on utility industry matters at Arthur Andersen & Company, less
any deductions hereinafter provided; provided, however, that for the purpose of
computing a monthly amount payable to Harreld under the Pension Plan no
limitation on benefits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code as it now exists or
is hereafter amended or any other limiting legislation shall be taken into
account. The computations required for the determination of the monthly payments
hereunder and the periods used as periods of Accredited Service shall be
calculated so as to give appropriate effect in each instance to the exclusion of
any portions of such period on account of eligibility, military service, leave
of absence, or otherwise as may be required under the Pension Plan as it shall
be in effect at the time such monthly payment is to be made. Harreld's right to
such payments shall not be absolute, and each payment thereof is contingent upon
Harreld's having duly performed the services required of him pursuant to
Paragraph 1 hereof as of the applicable payment date.

         3. If, in accordance with the terms of the Pension Plan, Harreld shall
have a Provisional Payee entitled to receive payments thereunder, then the
Provisional Payee shall be entitled to payments under this Agreement which, when
added to payments to her under the Pension Plan, would be appropriate if Harreld
were given credit for ten additional years of Accredited Service under the
Pension Plan in recognition of his time spent on utility industry matters at
Arthur Andersen & Company.

         4. The amounts payable to Harreld and any Provisional Payee pursuant to
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Agreement shall be made by GPC, SCS and Southern in
the same proportion as the Accredited Service credited to Harreld under the
Pension Plan at each Company bears to the total Accredited Service credited to
Harreld under the Pension Plan at all three Companies as of the date of
Harreld's retirement from GPC.

         5. Neither the entering into nor the termination of this Agreement for
any cause shall affect Harreld's right to such salary, fees or other
compensation for his services as an employee, officer or director of GPC or SCS
as either has agreed or may agree to pay him prior to or subsequent to his
termination of service, nor his right to participate in and receive benefits
under any plan or plans of GPC or SCS now existing, or which may hereafter
exist, providing benefits for their employees.

         6. Neither Harreld nor his Provisional Payee, if any, shall, under any
circumstances, have any option or right to require payments hereunder otherwise
than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and after the terms and
contingencies herein specified have been met. Except as specifically allowed by
law, neither Harreld nor any Provisional Payee shall have any power of
anticipation, alienation, mortgage, pledge, encumbrance or assignment of
payments contemplated hereunder, and all rights and benefits of Harreld and of
any Provisional Payee shall be for his or her sole personal benefit, and no
other person shall acquire any right, title or interest hereunder by reason of
any sale, assignment, mortgage, pledge, encumbrance, transfer, claim or judgment
or bankruptcy proceedings against Harreld or any Provisional Payee. Any attempt
to do so shall be null and void and of no effect.

         7. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to affect in
any manner the existing rights of GPC or Harreld to suspend, terminate, alter or
modify, whether or not for cause, the employment relationship contemplated by
Paragraph 1 hereof.

         8. The failure of any party to insist in any one or more instances upon
performance of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement shall not be
construed as a waiver or a relinquishment of any right granted hereunder or of
the future performance of any such term, covenant or condition, but the
obligation of either party with respect thereto shall continue in full force and
effect.

         9. GPC, SCS and Southern shall not reserve or otherwise set aside funds
for the payment of its obligations hereunder, which obligations shall be paid
solely from the general assets of GPC, SCS and Southern. Notwithstanding that
Harreld and any Provisional Payee shall be entitled to receive the entire
amounts stated herein, the assets from which such amounts shall be paid shall at
all times be subject to the claims of the creditors of GPC, SCS and Southern.

         10. There shall be deducted from the amount of any payment payable
under this Agreement the amount of any tax required by any governmental
authority to be withheld and paid to such governmental authority for the account
of Harreld or any Provisional Payee.

         11. Harreld, GPC, SCS and Southern agree that the validity of this
Agreement or any of the provisions hereof shall be determined under and


                                       3

<PAGE>

according to the laws of the State of Georgia, and that the Agreement and its
provisions shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of
that State.

         12. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and any successor to the business of GPC, SCS and Southern,
but neither this Agreement nor any right hereunder may be assigned by Harreld or
any Provisional Payee. This Agreement shall not be altered or amended except by
an agreement in writing signed by all parties hereto. In any event, the
Agreement shall, if not sooner terminated, terminate for all purposes upon the
death of Harreld, or if his Provisional Payee shall survive him and shall be
entitled to receive any payments hereunder, upon the death of the Provisional
Payee, and the satisfaction by GPC, SCS and Southern of their obligations
arising theretofore under the Agreement.

         13. This Agreement shall constitute the full and complete agreement
between the parties concerning its subject matter and fully supercedes any and
all other prior agreements or understandings between the parties concerning the
subject matter hereof, including but not limited to the GPC Agreement, the
Mirant Agreement and the SCS Agreement.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Georgia Power Company, Southern Company Services,
Inc. and the Southern Company have caused this amended and restated Agreement to
be executed by their duly authorized officers and C.B. Harreld has executed this
Agreement in quadruplicate on or as of the date and year first above written.

                              SEPARATION AGREEMENT

         THIS SEPARATION AGREEMENT ("Agreement") made and entered into by and
between GULF POWER COMPANY (the "Company") and JOHN E. HODGES ("Employee").

                               W I T N E S S E T H

         WHEREAS, Employee has been employed by the Company for approximately
thirty-seven (37) years;

         WHEREAS, Employee is a highly compensated employee of the Company and
is a member of its management;

         WHEREAS, in order to be eligible for benefits under this Agreement, the
parties have agreed that Employee must terminate employment with the Company on
June 1, 2003;

         WHEREAS, the parties desire to delineate their respective rights,
duties, and obligations attendant to such termination of employment, and desire
to reach an accord and satisfaction of all claims arising from Employee's
employment and his termination of employment, with appropriate releases; and

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to compensate Employee for service he has
provided or will provide for the Company;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and the agreements of
the parties set forth in this Agreement, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby covenant and agree as
follows:

         1. Termination of Employment. Upon Employee's execution of this
Agreement, voluntary termination of employment with the Company on June 1, 2003
(the Employee's "Termination Date"), and effectiveness of the Release attached
hereto as Exhibit 1 (such effectiveness being no earlier than Employee's
Termination Date), the Company agrees to pay to Employee or his spouse or his
estate, as applicable, the compensation described in Paragraph 2 hereof.
Employee covenants and agrees that the consideration set forth in Paragraph 2 is
in full satisfaction of all sums owed to Employee, if any, by the Company, and
constitutes good and complete consideration for his Release attached hereto as
Exhibit 1, those non-disclosure and non-interference obligations under
Paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 hereof and all other obligations and covenants of
Employee contained herein, including, but not limited to, Paragraph 4. Employee
agrees that this Agreement provides him certain benefits to which he would not
otherwise be entitled.

2. Compensation.

         (a) Installments. Beginning on the first day of the first month
following both the Employee's Termination Date and the effective date of the
Release attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (such effective date being no earlier than
Employee's Termination Date), the Company shall commence payment to Employee of
five annual installment payments equal to One Hundred Forty-Six Thousand Eight
Hundred Thirty-Five Dollars and No Cents ($146,835.00) per installment payment.
In the event Employee dies before receiving payment of the amounts described in
this Paragraph 2(a) hereof, such amounts shall be paid to Employee's spouse, if
living, or if not, to the Employee's estate.

         (b) Social Security Bridge Payments. Beginning on the first day of the
first month following Employee's Termination Date and the effective date of the
Release attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (such effective date being no earlier than

<PAGE>

the Employee's Termination Date), and ending on the first day of the first month
during which Employee attains age 62, the Company agrees to pay to Employee a
monthly benefit equal to the monthly Social Security benefit the Employee would
become entitled to receive beginning at age 65 based upon the Social Security
law in effect for the year of his Termination Date and his Southern Company
System (as defined in Paragraph 4) Social Security earnings through his
Termination Date ("Social Security Bridge Benefit"). Upon the death of the
Employee, no unpaid amounts set forth in this Paragraph 2(b) shall be payable to
Employee's heirs or assigns unless Employee has designated a provisional payee
or a provisional payee is designated for him by default under The Southern
Company Pension Plan ("Pension Plan") and such provisional payee is then living.
If the provisions in the foregoing sentence are met, then beginning on the first
day of the first month after the date of the Employee's death, said provisional
payee, if then living, shall be entitled to the Social Security Bridge Benefit
until the first day of the first month during which the Employee would have
attained age 62. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the death of such
provisional payee, no unpaid amounts set forth above shall be payable to such
provisional payee's heirs or assigns. Such provisional payee shall only be
entitled to the benefit payments set forth in this Paragraph 2(b) that become
due and payable between Employee's death and the death of the provisional payee.

         (c) Change in Control. In the event of a Southern Change in Control or
a Subsidiary Change in Control affecting Employee as defined in the Southern
Company Change in Control Benefit Plan Determination Policy, any unpaid amounts
under Paragraphs 2(a) and (b) shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable
after the occurrence of such an event. The lump sum shall be equal to the

<PAGE>

present value of any unpaid amounts based on an effective interest rate of 7.5%
per annum (0.6045% per month).

         (d) Other Compensation. Subject to Paragraph 1, on the effective date
of the Release attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (such effective date being no
earlier than Employee's Termination Date), the Company shall provide Employee
with (i) access to the Company's tax preparation and financial planning services
for a period of two years following Employee's Termination Date and (ii) the
personal computer he is using on his Termination Date.

         (e) Misconduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Employee
engages in Misconduct, as defined below, before or after Employee's Termination
Date but prior to receiving all of the compensation described in Paragraphs
2(a), (b) and (d) above, Company may not provide the Employee with the
compensation under this Paragraph 2, and Company shall have no further
obligations with respect to any amounts or compensation under this Agreement.
For purposes of this Paragraph 2(e), "Misconduct" shall mean (i) the final
conviction of any felony, or (ii) the carrying out of any activity or the making
of any public statement which materially diminishes or materially and
untruthfully brings the Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates into contempt, ridicule or materially and reasonably shocks or
offends the community in which the Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries
or affiliates is located.

         (f) Withholding. In accordance with Paragraph 21, Employee shall be
responsible for all state and federal income taxes and his share of FICA taxes
owed on the foregoing compensation (including, but not limited to, the
compensation provided in subparagraph (d) above), and Company shall make
appropriate withholding of these amounts.

         3. Publicity; No Disparaging Statement. Except as otherwise provided in
Paragraph 14 hereof, Employee and the Company covenant and agree that they shall

<PAGE>

                           information related to the rate making process of the

                           developed by Employee during the term of his
                           employment with the Company.

         7. Nondisclosure: Ownership of Proprietary Property.

         (a) In recognition of the need of the Company to protect its legitimate
business interests, Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, Employee hereby
covenants and agrees that Employee shall regard and treat Trade Secrets and all
Confidential Information as strictly confidential and wholly-owned by the
Company and shall not, for any reason, in any fashion, either directly or
indirectly, use, sell, lend, lease, distribute, license, give, transfer, assign,
show, disclose, disseminate, reproduce, copy, misappropriate or otherwise
communicate any such item or information to any third party or Entity for any
purpose other than in accordance with this Agreement or as required by
applicable law: (i) with regard to each item constituting a Trade Secret, at all
times such information remains a "trade secret" under applicable law, and (ii)
with regard to any Confidential Information, for a period of three (3) years
following the Termination Date (hereafter the "Restricted Period").

         (b) Employee shall exercise best efforts to ensure the continued
confidentiality of all Trade Secrets and Confidential Information, and he shall

<PAGE>

immediately notify the Company of any unauthorized disclosure or use of any
Trade Secrets or Confidential Information of which Employee becomes aware.
Employee shall assist the Company, to the extent necessary, in the protection of
or procurement of any intellectual property protection or other rights in any of
the Trade Secrets or Confidential Information.

         (c) All Work Product shall be owned exclusively by the Company. To the
greatest extent possible, any Work Product shall be deemed to be "work made for
hire" (as defined in the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.A. ss. 101 et seq., as
amended), and Employee hereby unconditionally and irrevocably transfers and
assigns to the Company all right, title and interest Employee currently has or
may have by operation of law or otherwise in or to any Work Product, including,
without limitation, all patents, copyrights, trademarks (and the goodwill
associated therewith), trade secrets, service marks (and the goodwill associated
therewith) and other intellectual property rights. Employee agrees to execute
and deliver to the Company any transfers, assignments, documents or other
instruments which the Company may deem necessary or appropriate, from time to
time, to protect the rights granted herein or to vest complete title and
ownership of any and all Work Product, and all associated intellectual property
and other rights therein, exclusively in the Company.

         (d) Employee represents and agrees that he will keep all terms and
provisions of this Agreement completely confidential, except for possible
disclosures to his legal advisors or to the extent required by law, and Employee
further agrees that he will not disclose the terms, provisions or information
contained in or concerning this Agreement to anyone, including, but not limited
to, any past, present, or prospective employee or applicant for employment with
the Company. Employee agrees that he may only disclose to future, potential

<PAGE>

employers of Employee that he participates in a Separation Agreement with the
Company which imposes certain restrictions on him.

         8. Non-Interference With Employees.

         Employee covenants and agrees that during the Restricted Period he will
not, either directly or indirectly, alone or in conjunction with any other
person or Entity: (A) actively recruit, solicit, attempt to solicit, or induce
any person who, during such Restricted Period, or within one year prior to the
Termination Date, was an exempt employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or was an officer of any of the other Southern Entities to leave
or cease such employment for any reason whatsoever; or (B) hire or engage the
services of any such person described in Paragraph 8(A) in any business
substantially similar or competitive with that in which the Southern Entities
were engaged during his employment.

         9. Non-Interference With Customers.

         (a) Employee acknowledges that in the course of employment, he has
learned about Company's business, services, materials, programs and products and
the manner in which they are developed, marketed, serviced and provided.
Employee knows and acknowledges that the Company has invested considerable time
and money in developing its programs, agreements, offices, representatives,
services, products and marketing techniques and that they are unique and
original. Employee further acknowledges that the Company must keep secret all
pertinent information divulged to Employee and Company's business concepts,
ideas, programs, plans and processes, so as not to aid Company's competitors.
Accordingly, Company is entitled to the following protection, which Employee
agrees is reasonable:

         (b) Employee covenants and agrees that for a period of two (2) years
following the Termination Date, he will not, on his own behalf or on behalf of
any person or Entity, solicit, direct, appropriate, call upon, or initiate
communication or contact with any person or entity or any representative of any

<PAGE>

person or entity, with whom Employee had contact during his employment, with a
view toward the sale or the providing of any product, equipment or service sold
or provided or under development by Company during the period of two (2) years
immediately preceding the date of Employee's termination. The restrictions set
forth in this section shall apply only to persons or entities with whom Employee
had actual contact during the two (2) years prior to termination of employment
with a view toward the sale or providing of any product, equipment or service
sold or provided or under development by Company.

         10. Non-Interference With Business.

         (a) Employee and Company expressly covenant and agree that the scope,
territorial, time and other restrictions contained in this entire Agreement
constitute the most reasonable and equitable restrictions possible to protect
the business interest of the Company given: (i) the business of the Company;
(ii) the competitive nature of the Company's industry; and (iii) that Employee's
skills are such that he could easily find alternative, commensurate employment
or consulting work in his field which would not violate any of the provisions of
this Agreement. The Employee further acknowledges that the compensation
described in Paragraph 2 is also in consideration of his covenants and
agreements contained in Paragraphs 6 through 10 hereof.

         (b) In the event Employee and the Company do not enter into the
Consulting Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 2, Employee covenants and agrees
to not obtain or work in a Competitive Position within the Territory for a
period of two (2) years from the Termination Date.

         11. Return of Materials. Upon the Employee's termination, or at any
point after that time upon the specific request of the Company, Employee shall
return to the Company all written or descriptive materials of any kind belonging

<PAGE>

or relating to the Company or its affiliates, including, without limitation, any
originals, copies and abstracts containing any Work Product, intellectual
property, Confidential Information and Trade Secrets in Employee's possession or
control.

         12. Cooperation. The parties agree that as a result of Employee's
duties and activities during his employment, Employee's reasonable availability
may be necessary for the Company to meaningfully respond to or address actual or
threatened litigation, or government inquiries or investigations, or required
filings with state, federal or foreign agencies (hereinafter "Company Matters").
Upon request of the Company, and at any point following termination of
employment, Employee will make himself available to the Company for reasonable
periods consistent with his future employment, if any, by other Entities and
will cooperate with its agents and attorneys as reasonably required by such
Company Matters. The Company will reimburse Employee for any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses associated with providing such cooperation.

         13. Termination with Cause. In the event of Employee's termination of
employment for Cause at any time, the Employee shall forfeit all of the benefits
provided in Paragraph 2 and the Company shall have no further obligations with
respect to any amounts under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term
"Cause" shall mean gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of
the duties and services required in the course of employment by the Company; the
final conviction of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; the
carrying out of any activity or the making of any statement which would
prejudice the good name and standing of any of the Southern Entities or would
bring any of the Southern Entities into contempt, ridicule or would reasonably
shock or offend any community in which any of the Southern Entities is located;
a material breach of the fiduciary obligations owed by an officer and an

<PAGE>

employee to any of the Southern Entities; or the Employee's unsatisfactory
performance of the duties and services required by his or her employment.

         14. Confidentiality and Legal Process. Employee represents and agrees
that he will keep the terms, amount and fact of this Agreement confidential and
that he will not hereafter disclose any information concerning this Agreement to
any one other than his personal agents, including, but not limited to, any past,
present, or prospective employee or applicant for employment with Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement is intended to prohibit
Employee from performing any duty or obligation that shall arise as a matter of
law. Specifically, Employee shall continue to be under a duty to truthfully
respond to any legal and valid subpoena or other legal process. This Agreement
is not intended in any way to proscribe Employee's right and ability to provide
information to any federal, state or local government in the lawful exercise of
such governments' governmental functions.

         15. Successors And Assigns; Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of Employee and his heirs, administrators,
representatives, executors, successors and assigns, and shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Company and its officers, directors, employees,
agents, shareholders, parent corporation and affiliates, and their respective
predecessors, successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators and each
of them, and to their heirs, administrators, representatives, executors,
successors and assigns. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, United States of America
(without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws).

         16. Complete Agreement. This Agreement shall constitute the full and
complete Agreement between the parties concerning its subject matter and fully

<PAGE>

supersedes any and all other prior Agreements or understandings between the
parties concerning the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be
modified or amended except by a written instrument signed by both Employee and
an authorized representative of the Company.

         17. Severability. The unenforceability or invalidity of any particular
provision of this Agreement shall not affect its other provisions, and to the
extent necessary to give such other provisions effect, they shall be deemed
severable. The judicial body interpreting this Agreement shall be authorized and
instructed to rewrite any of the sections which are enforceable as written in
such a fashion so that they may be enforced to the greatest extent legally
possible. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, the covenants and
agreements contained in Paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, shall be construed as
covenants and agreements independent of each other or any other contract between
the parties hereto and that the existence of any claim or cause of action by
Employee against Company, whether predicated upon this Agreement or any other
contract, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Company of said
covenants and agreements.

         18. Waiver Of Breach; Specific Performance. The waiver of a breach of
any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of
any other breach. Each of the parties to this Agreement will be entitled to
enforce its or his rights under this Agreement, specifically, to recover damages
by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all
other rights existing in its or his favor. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of
the provisions of this Agreement and that any party may in its or his sole
discretion apply to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for
specific performance or injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent any
violations of the provisions of this Agreement.


<PAGE>

         19. Unsecured General Creditor. The Company shall neither reserve nor
specifically set aside funds for the payment of its obligations under this
Agreement, and such obligations shall be paid solely from the general assets of
the Company. Notwithstanding that Employee may be entitled to receive the value
of his benefit under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the assets from
which such amount may be paid shall at all times be subject to the claims of the
Company's creditors.

         20. No Effect On Other Arrangements. It is expressly understood and
agreed that the payments made in accordance with this Agreement are in addition
to any other benefits or compensation to which Employee may be entitled or for
which he may be eligible, whether funded or unfunded, by reason of his
employment with the Company.

         21. Tax Withholding. There shall be deducted from each payment under
this Agreement the amount of any tax required by any governmental authority to
be withheld and paid over by the Company to such governmental authority for the
account of Employee.

         22. Compensation. Any compensation paid on behalf of Employee under
this Agreement shall not be considered "compensation," as the term is defined in
The Southern Company Employee Savings Plan, The Southern Company Employee Stock
Ownership Plan or The Southern Company Pension Plan. The payments under this
Agreement shall not be considered wages, salaries or compensation under any
other employee benefit plan.

         23. No Guarantee of Employment. No provision of this Agreement shall be
construed to affect in any manner the existing rights of the Company to suspend,
terminate, alter, modify, whether or not for cause, the employment relationship
of Employee and the Company.


<PAGE>

         24. Interpretation. The judicial body interpreting this Agreement shall
not more strictly construe the terms of this Agreement against one party, it
being agreed that both parties and/or their attorneys or agents have negotiated
and participated in the preparation hereof.


         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement,
this ___ day of ________________, 2003.

         (a) Consultant covenants and agrees that during the Term of this
Agreement, and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, it shall not, nor shall
its agents, employees or subcontractors either directly or indirectly, for
itself or themselves or in conjunction with or on behalf of any Entity: (i)
solicit, divert or appropriate or attempt to solicit, divert or appropriate any
customer or actively sought prospective customer of Company or any other
Southern Entity whom Consultant, its agents, employees or subcontractors, has
solicited, provided service to or otherwise had significant contact with while
providing services to Company or any other Southern Entity pursuant to this
Agreement (hereinafter "Customer"); (ii) refer, recommend or otherwise suggest
to any Customer the services of any Entity other than Company or any other
Southern Entity with respect to those types of services which the Southern

otherwise suggest to any Entity to provide or seek to provide services to any
Customer with respect to those types of services which the Southern Entities are
in the business of providing; (iv) seek or accept a Competitive Position with a
Customer. In addition, Consultant covenants and agrees that during the Term of

<PAGE>

this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, it shall not, nor
shall its agents, employees or subcontractors either directly or indirectly, for
itself or themselves or in conjunction with or on behalf of any Entity solicit,
divert or appropriate or attempt to solicit, divert or appropriate any employee

to require each of its agents, employees or subcontractors who will perform

         (b) Consultant covenants and agrees that for a period of two (2) years
following the expiration or termination of this Agreement within the States of

wholly or in material part in the business that the Company is engaged in
whereby the Consultant is required to or does perform services on behalf of or
for the benefit of such person or Entity which are substantially similar to the
services Consultant participated in or directed for the Company, the Southern
Company or any of their respective affiliates during the Term of this Agreement.

         (c) Consultant and Company expressly covenant and agree that the scope,
territorial, time and other restrictions contained in this entire Agreement
constitute the most reasonable and equitable restrictions possible to protect
the business interest of the Company given: (i) the business of the Company;
(ii) the competitive nature of the Company's industry; and (iii) that
Consultant's skills are such that it could easily find alternative, commensurate
work in its field which would not violate any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

<PAGE>

         9.Remedies. The parties represent and agree that any disclosure or use
of any Trade Secrets or Confidential Information by Consultant, its agents,
employees or subcontractors except as otherwise authorized by the Company in
writing, or any other violation of Paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 would be wrongful and
cause immediate, significant, continuing and irreparable injury and damage to
Company and the other Southern Entities that is not fully compensable by
monetary damages. Should Consultant breach or threaten to breach any provision
of Paragraphs 6, 7 and 8, Company and any other Southern Entity shall be
entitled to obtain immediate relief and remedies in a court of competent
jurisdiction (including but not limited to damages, preliminary or permanent
injunctive relief and an accounting for all profits and benefits arising out of

remedies to which Company and the other Southern Entities may be entitled by
this Agreement, at law or in equity.

with all federal, state, and local statutes, regulations, and public ordinances

Southern harmless from any and all liability, damage, cost, fine, penalty, fee
and expense arising from Consultant's failure to do so.

         11. Notices. All notices required, necessary or desired to be given
pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be effective when
delivered or on the third day following the date upon which such notice is
deposited, postage prepaid, in the United States mail, certified return receipt
requested, and addressed to the party at the address set forth below:

          If to Consultant:                            If to Company:

<PAGE>

         12. Indemnification. Consultant shall and does hereby expressly agree
to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors,
shareholders, employees, parent and affiliates against any and all suits,
actions, judgments, costs (including, without limitation, all court costs and
attorneys' fees), losses, damages, or claims of whatever nature arising out of
or related to any acts or omissions of Consultant, its agents, employees or
subcontractors, including, but not limited to, any injuries to or deaths of
persons or any damage to property or equipment. Consultant further agrees to
defend any and all such actions in any court or in arbitration.

         13. Waiver of Breach. The waiver by any party to this Agreement of a
breach of any provision, section or paragraph of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same, or of
a different provision, section or paragraph, by any party hereto.

         14. Assignment by Consultant. Consultant may not assign, transfer or
subcontract any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any party
without the prior written consent of the Company. Consultant's obligations under
this Agreement shall be binding on Consultant's successors and permitted
assigns. Any assignment, transfer or subcontracting in violation of this
provision shall be null and void.

         15. Survival. Notwithstanding any expiration or termination of this
Agreement, the provisions of Sections 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18
and 19 hereof shall survive and remain in full force and effect, as shall any
other provision hereof that, by its terms or reasonable interpretation thereof,
sets forth obligations that extend beyond the termination of this Agreement.

         16. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without giving effect to
conflicts of law provisions.

<PAGE>

         17. Severability. The unenforceability or invalidity of any particular
provision of this Agreement shall not affect its other provisions, and to the
extent necessary to give such other provisions effect, they shall be deemed
severable. The judicial body interpreting this Agreement shall be authorized and
instructed to rewrite any of the sections which are enforceable as written in
such a fashion so that they may be enforced to the greatest extent legally
possible. Consultant acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, the covenants and
agreements contained in Paragraphs 6, 7, and 8, shall be construed as covenants
and agreements independent of each other or any other contract between the
parties hereto and that the existence of any claim or cause of action by
Consultant against Company, whether predicated upon this Agreement or any other
contract, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Company of said
covenants and agreements.

         18. Interpretation. Should a provision of this Agreement require
judicial interpretation, it is agreed that the judicial body interpreting or
construing the Agreement shall not apply the assumption that the terms hereof
shall be more strictly construed against one party by reason of the rule of
construction that an instrument is to be construed more strictly against the
party which itself or through its agents prepared the agreement, it being agreed
that all parties and/or their agents have participated in the preparation
hereof.

         19. Entire Agreement. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement of
the parties and supersedes all prior agreements between the parties hereto
relating to the subject matter hereof. It may not be changed orally, but only by
an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any
waiver, change, modification, extension or discharge is sought.

         18. Interpretation. Should a provision of this Agreement require
judicial interpretation, it is agreed that the judicial body interpreting or
construing the Agreement shall not apply the assumption that the terms hereof

party which itself or through its agents prepared the agreement, it being agreed
that all parties and/or their agents have participated in the preparation
hereof.

         19. Entire Agreement. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement of
the parties and supersedes all prior agreements between the parties hereto
relating to the subject matter hereof. It may not be changed orally, but only by

waiver, change, modification, extension or discharge is sought.

                              SEPARATION AGREEMENT

         THIS SEPARATION AGREEMENT ("Agreement") made and entered into by and
between GULF POWER COMPANY (the "Company") and WARREN E. TATE ("Employee").

                               W I T N E S S E T H

         WHEREAS, Employee has been employed by the Company for approximately
thirty-nine (39) years;

         WHEREAS, Employee is a highly compensated employee of the Company and
is a member of its management;

         WHEREAS, in order to be eligible for benefits under this Agreement, the
parties have agreed that Employee must terminate employment with the Company on
September 1, 2003.

         WHEREAS, the parties desire to delineate their respective rights,
duties, and obligations attendant to such termination of employment, and desire
to reach an accord and satisfaction of all claims arising from Employee's
employment and his termination of employment, with appropriate releases; and

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to compensate Employee for service he has
provided or will provide for the Company;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and the agreements of
the parties set forth in this Agreement, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby covenant and agree as
follows:

<PAGE>

         1. Termination of Employment. Upon Employee's execution of this
Agreement, voluntary termination of employment with the Company on September 1,
2003 (the Employee's "Termination Date"), and effectiveness of the Release
attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (such effectiveness being no earlier than
Employee's Termination Date), the Company agrees to pay to Employee or his
spouse or his estate, as applicable, the compensation described in Paragraph 2
hereof. Employee covenants and agrees that the consideration set forth in
Paragraph 2 is in full satisfaction of all sums owed to Employee, if any, by the
Company, and constitutes good and complete consideration for his Release
attached hereto as Exhibit 1, those non-disclosure and non-interference
obligations under Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 hereof and all other obligations
and covenants of Employee contained herein, including, but not limited to,
Paragraph 4. Employee agrees that this Agreement provides him certain benefits
to which he would not otherwise be entitled.

         2. Compensation.

         (a) Installments. Beginning on the first day of the first month
following both the Employee's Termination Date and the effective date of the
Release attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (such effective date being no earlier than
Employee's Termination Date), the Company shall commence payment to Employee of
five annual installment payments equal to One Hundred Eleven Thousand Nine
Hundred Ninety-Three Dollars and No Cents ($111,993.00) per installment payment.
In the event Employee dies before receiving payment of the amounts described in
this Paragraph 2(a) hereof, such amounts shall be paid to Employee's spouse, if
living, or if not, to the Employee's estate.

         (b) Social Security Bridge Payments. Beginning on the first day of the
first month following Employee's Termination Date and the effective date of the
Release attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (such effective date being no earlier than

<PAGE>

the Employee's Termination Date), and ending on the first day of the first month
during which Employee attains age 62, the Company agrees to pay to Employee a
monthly benefit equal to the monthly Social Security benefit the Employee would
become entitled to receive beginning at age 65 based upon the Social Security
law in effect for the year of his Termination Date and his Southern Company
System (as defined in Paragraph 4) Social Security earnings through his
Termination Date ("Social Security Bridge Benefit"). Upon the death of the
Employee, no unpaid amounts set forth in this Paragraph 2(b) shall be payable to
Employee's heirs or assigns unless Employee has designated a provisional payee
or a provisional payee is designated for him by default under The Southern
Company Pension Plan ("Pension Plan") and such provisional payee is then living.
If the provisions in the foregoing sentence are met, then beginning on the first
day of the first month after the date of the Employee's death, said provisional
payee, if then living, shall be entitled to the Social Security Bridge Benefit
until the first day of the first month during which the Employee would have
attained age 62. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the death of such
provisional payee, no unpaid amounts set forth above shall be payable to such
provisional payee's heirs or assigns. Such provisional payee shall only be
entitled to the benefit payments set forth in this Paragraph 2(b) that become
due and payable between Employee's death and the death of the provisional payee.

         (c) Change in Control. In the event of a Southern Change in Control or
a Subsidiary Change in Control affecting Employee as defined in the Southern
Company Change in Control Benefit Plan Determination Policy, any unpaid amounts
under Paragraphs 2(a) and (b) shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable
after the occurrence of such an event. The lump sum shall be equal to the
present value of any unpaid amounts based on an effective interest rate of 7.5%
per annum (0.6045% per month).

         (d) Other Compensation. Subject to Paragraph 1, on the effective date
of the Release attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (such effective date being no
earlier than Employee's Termination Date), the Company shall provide Employee
with (i) access to the Company's tax preparation and financial planning services
for a period of two years following Employee's Termination Date, and (ii) the
personal computers he is using on his Termination Date.

         (e) Misconduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Employee
engages in Misconduct, as defined below, before or after Employee's Termination
Date but prior to receiving all of the compensation described in Paragraphs
2(a), (b) and (d) above, Company may not provide the Employee with the
compensation under this Paragraph 2, and Company shall have no further
obligations with respect to any amounts or compensation under this Agreement.
For purposes of this Paragraph 2(e), "Misconduct" shall mean (i) the final
conviction of any felony, or (ii) the carrying out of any activity or the making
of any public statement which materially diminishes or materially and
untruthfully brings the Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates into contempt, ridicule or materially and reasonably shocks or
offends the community in which the Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries
or affiliates is located.

         (f) Withholding. In accordance with Paragraph 20, Employee shall be
responsible for all state and federal income taxes and his share of FICA taxes
owed on the foregoing compensation (including, but not limited to, the
compensation provided in subparagraph (d) above), and Company shall make
appropriate withholding of these amounts.


<PAGE>

         3. Publicity; No Disparaging Statement. Except as otherwise provided in
Paragraph 13 hereof, Employee and the Company covenant and agree that they shall
not engage in any communications which shall disparage one another or interfere
with their existing or prospective business relationships.


<PAGE>

         4. No Employment. Employee agrees that he shall not seek re-employment
as an employee, leased employee or independent contractor with the Company or
the Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, for
purposes of this Paragraph 4, "Southern Company System"), for a period of
twenty-four (24) months following the execution of the Release attached hereto
as Exhibit 1. The Company or any member of the Southern Company System shall not
rehire the Employee as an employee, leased employee or independent contractor
for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the Employee's execution of
the Release attached hereto as Exhibit 1, unless an exceptional business reason
exists for rehiring the Employee and a committee, comprised of (i) an officer
from the business unit seeking to rehire the Employee and (ii) the Southern
Company Senior Vice President, Human Resources, approves of such rehiring.

<PAGE>

                           developed by Employee during the term of his
                           employment with the Company.

         6. Nondisclosure: Ownership of Proprietary Property.

         (a) In recognition of the need of the Company to protect its legitimate
business interests, Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, Employee hereby
covenants and agrees that Employee shall regard and treat Trade Secrets and all
Confidential Information as strictly confidential and wholly-owned by the
Company and shall not, for any reason, in any fashion, either directly or
indirectly, use, sell, lend, lease, distribute, license, give, transfer, assign,
show, disclose, disseminate, reproduce, copy, misappropriate or otherwise
communicate any such item or information to any third party or Entity for any
purpose other than in accordance with this Agreement or as required by
applicable law: (i) with regard to each item constituting a Trade Secret, at all
times such information remains a "trade secret" under applicable law, and (ii)
with regard to any Confidential Information, for a period of three (3) years
following the Termination Date (hereafter the "Restricted Period").

         (b) Employee shall exercise best efforts to ensure the continued
confidentiality of all Trade Secrets and Confidential Information, and he shall
immediately notify the Company of any unauthorized disclosure or use of any
Trade Secrets or Confidential Information of which Employee becomes aware.
Employee shall assist the Company, to the extent necessary, in the protection of
or procurement of any intellectual property protection or other rights in any of
the Trade Secrets or Confidential Information.

         (c) All Work Product shall be owned exclusively by the Company. To the
greatest extent possible, any Work Product shall be deemed to be "work made for
hire" (as defined in the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.A. ss. 101 et seq., as
amended), and Employee hereby unconditionally and irrevocably transfers and

<PAGE>

assigns to the Company all right, title and interest Employee currently has or
may have by operation of law or otherwise in or to any Work Product, including,
without limitation, all patents, copyrights, trademarks (and the goodwill
associated therewith), trade secrets, service marks (and the goodwill associated
therewith) and other intellectual property rights. Employee agrees to execute
and deliver to the Company any transfers, assignments, documents or other
instruments which the Company may deem necessary or appropriate, from time to
time, to protect the rights granted herein or to vest complete title and
ownership of any and all Work Product, and all associated intellectual property
and other rights therein, exclusively in the Company.

         (d) Employee represents and agrees that he will keep all terms and
provisions of this Agreement completely confidential, except for possible
disclosures to his legal advisors or to the extent required by law, and Employee
further agrees that he will not disclose the terms, provisions or information
contained in or concerning this Agreement to anyone, including, but not limited
to, any past, present, or prospective employee or applicant for employment with
the Company. Employee agrees that he may only disclose to future, potential
employers of Employee that he participates in a Separation Agreement with the
Company which imposes certain restrictions on him.

         7. Non-Interference With Employees.

         Employee covenants and agrees that during the Restricted Period he will
not, either directly or indirectly, alone or in conjunction with any other
person or Entity: (A) actively recruit, solicit, attempt to solicit, or induce
any person who, during such Restricted Period, or within one year prior to the
Termination Date, was an exempt employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or was an officer of any of the other Southern Entities to leave
or cease such employment for any reason whatsoever; or (B) hire or engage the
services of any such person described in Paragraph 7(A) in any business

<PAGE>

substantially similar or competitive with that in which the Southern Entities
were engaged during his employment.

         8. Non-Interference With Customers.

         (a) Employee acknowledges that in the course of employment, he has
learned about Company's business, services, materials, programs and products and
the manner in which they are developed, marketed, serviced and provided.
Employee knows and acknowledges that the Company has invested considerable time
and money in developing its programs, agreements, offices, representatives,
services, products and marketing techniques and that they are unique and
original. Employee further acknowledges that the Company must keep secret all
pertinent information divulged to Employee and Company's business concepts,
ideas, programs, plans and processes, so as not to aid Company's competitors.
Accordingly, Company is entitled to the following protection, which Employee
agrees is reasonable:

         (b) Employee covenants and agrees that for a period of two (2) years
following the Termination Date, he will not, on his own behalf or on behalf of
any person or Entity, solicit, direct, appropriate, call upon, or initiate
communication or contact with any person or entity or any representative of any
person or entity, with whom Employee had contact during his employment, with a
view toward the sale or the providing of any product, equipment or service sold
or provided or under development by Company during the period of two (2) years
immediately preceding the date of Employee's termination. The restrictions set
forth in this section shall apply only to persons or entities with whom Employee
had actual contact during the two (2) years prior to termination of employment
with a view toward the sale or providing of any product, equipment or service
sold or provided or under development by Company.


<PAGE>

         9. Non-Interference With Business.

         (a) Employee and Company expressly covenant and agree that the scope,
territorial, time and other restrictions contained in this entire Agreement
constitute the most reasonable and equitable restrictions possible to protect
the business interest of the Company given: (i) the business of the Company;
(ii) the competitive nature of the Company's industry; and (iii) that Employee's
skills are such that he could easily find alternative, commensurate employment
or consulting work in his field which would not violate any of the provisions of
this Agreement. The Employee further acknowledges that the compensation
described in Paragraph 2 is also in consideration of his covenants and
agreements contained in Paragraphs 5 through 9 hereof.

         (b) Employee covenants and agrees to not obtain or work in a
Competitive Position within the Territory for a period of two (2) years from the
Termination Date.

         10. Return of Materials. Upon the Employee's termination, or at any
point after that time upon the specific request of the Company, Employee shall
return to the Company all written or descriptive materials of any kind belonging
or relating to the Company or its affiliates, including, without limitation, any
originals, copies and abstracts containing any Work Product, intellectual
property, Confidential Information and Trade Secrets in Employee's possession or
control.

         11. Cooperation. The parties agree that as a result of Employee's
duties and activities during his employment, Employee's reasonable availability
may be necessary for the Company to meaningfully respond to or address actual or
threatened litigation, or government inquiries or investigations, or required
filings with state, federal or foreign agencies (hereinafter "Company Matters").
Upon request of the Company, and at any point following termination of

<PAGE>

employment, Employee will make himself available to the Company for reasonable
periods consistent with his future employment, if any, by other Entities and
will cooperate with its agents and attorneys as reasonably required by such
Company Matters. The Company will reimburse Employee for any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses associated with providing such cooperation.

         12. Termination with Cause. In the event of Employee's termination of
employment for Cause at any time, the Employee shall forfeit all of the benefits
provided in Paragraph 2 and the Company shall have no further obligations with
respect to any amounts under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term
"Cause" shall mean gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of
the duties and services required in the course of employment by the Company; the
final conviction of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; the
carrying out of any activity or the making of any statement which would
prejudice the good name and standing of any of the Southern Entities or would
bring any of the Southern Entities into contempt, ridicule or would reasonably
shock or offend any community in which any of the Southern Entities is located;
a material breach of the fiduciary obligations owed by an officer and an
employee to any of the Southern Entities; or the Employee's unsatisfactory
performance of the duties and services required by his or her employment.

         13. Confidentiality and Legal Process. Employee represents and agrees
that he will keep the terms, amount and fact of this Agreement confidential and
that he will not hereafter disclose any information concerning this Agreement to
any one other than his personal agents, including, but not limited to, any past,

law. Specifically, Employee shall continue to be under a duty to truthfully

<PAGE>

respond to any legal and valid subpoena or other legal process. This Agreement
is not intended in any way to proscribe Employee's right and ability to provide
information to any federal, state or local government in the lawful exercise of
such governments' governmental functions.

         14. Successors And Assigns; Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of Employee and his heirs, administrators,

parties concerning the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be
modified or amended except by a written instrument signed by both Employee and
an authorized representative of the Company.

         16. Severability. The unenforceability or invalidity of any particular
provision of this Agreement shall not affect its other provisions, and to the
extent necessary to give such other provisions effect, they shall be deemed
severable. The judicial body interpreting this Agreement shall be authorized and
instructed to rewrite any of the sections which are enforceable as written in
such a fashion so that they may be enforced to the greatest extent legally

<PAGE>

possible. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, the covenants and
agreements contained in Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, shall be construed as
covenants and agreements independent of each other or any other contract between
the parties hereto and that the existence of any claim or cause of action by
Employee against Company, whether predicated upon this Agreement or any other
contract, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Company of said
covenants and agreements.

         17. Waiver Of Breach; Specific Performance. The waiver of a breach of
any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of
any other breach. Each of the parties to this Agreement will be entitled to
enforce its or his rights under this Agreement, specifically, to recover damages
by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all
other rights existing in its or his favor. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of
the provisions of this Agreement and that any party may in its or his sole
discretion apply to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for
specific performance or injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent any
violations of the provisions of this Agreement.

         18. Unsecured General Creditor. The Company shall neither reserve nor
specifically set aside funds for the payment of its obligations under this
Agreement, and such obligations shall be paid solely from the general assets of
the Company. Notwithstanding that Employee may be entitled to receive the value
of his benefit under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the assets from
which such amount may be paid shall at all times be subject to the claims of the
Company's creditors.

         19. No Effect On Other Arrangements. It is expressly understood and
agreed that the payments made in accordance with this Agreement are in addition

<PAGE>

to any other benefits or compensation to which Employee may be entitled or for
which he may be eligible, whether funded or unfunded, by reason of his
employment with the Company.

         20. Tax Withholding. There shall be deducted from the payment under
this Agreement the amount of any tax required by any governmental authority to
be withheld and paid over by the Company to such governmental authority for the
account of Employee.

         21. Compensation. Any compensation paid on behalf of Employee under
this Agreement shall not be considered "compensation," as the term is defined in

Ownership Plan or The Southern Company Pension Plan. The payment under this
Agreement shall not be considered wages, salaries or compensation under any
other employee benefit plan.

         22. No Guarantee of Employment. No provision of this Agreement shall be
construed to affect in any manner the existing rights of the Company to suspend,
terminate, alter, modify, whether or not for cause, the employment relationship
of Employee and the Company.

         23. Interpretation. The judicial body interpreting this Agreement shall
not more strictly construe the terms of this Agreement against one party, it
being agreed that both parties and/or their attorneys or agents have negotiated
and participated in the preparation hereof.
